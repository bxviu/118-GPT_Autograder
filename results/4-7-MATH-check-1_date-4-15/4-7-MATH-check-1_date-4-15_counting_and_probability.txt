It must either rain tomorrow or not rain tomorrow, so the sum of the probability that it rains and the probability it doesn't rain is 1.  Therefore, the probability it doesn't rain is $1 - \frac{1}{11} = \boxed{\frac{10}{11}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
For $n$ dice, there are $\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \cdot 6^n}=\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\begin{aligned}{{47}\over{288}}&=
4\left({1\over6}\right)^2+2\left({1\over6}+x\right)
\left({1\over6}-x\right)\cr&=
{4\over36}+2\left({1\over36}-x^2\right)\cr&=
{1\over6}-2x^2.\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\boxed{29}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\frac{2005}{3} = 668\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{4} = 501\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{12} = 167\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.

Every multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)

We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\dbinom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\dbinom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.

We begin by finding all possible ways to arrange the 1, 2, 3, and 6.  There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\boxed{25}$ orderings in all.

Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.

Extracting Answer from: 
If the resulting integer is divisible by 11 then the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits has the same remainder when divided by 11 as the sum of the second and fourth digits. This only occurs when the first, third, and fifth digits are 2, 3, and 7 (in some order) and the second and fourth digits are 4 and 8 (in some order).

There are $\binom{5}{2}$ total ways to partition these five digits into a group of 3 and a group of 2. From above, only one of these partitions will result in five-digit integers that are divisible by 11. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \[ abc = 2310 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11,\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.

Finally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \[\frac{240}{3!} = \frac{240}{6} = \boxed{40}.\]

There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one.

First choose a seat for Alice. It doesn't matter what seat we choose because we can rotate the table to move Alice's seat to wherever we want. After Alice's seat has been chosen, there are five seats Bob is willing to sit in. Of these seats, 2 are two seats away from Alice, and 3 are not. If Bob sits in either of the locations two seats away from Alice, there will be 3 places left Eve is willing to sit. If he sits in one of the other seats, there will be 2 places left Eve is willing to sit. Once Alice, Bob, and Eve's seats have been chosen, the remaining people can be placed in $5!$ ways.

Extracting Answer from: 
After some trial and error, we obtain the two lists $\{4,5,7,8,9\}$ and $\{3,6,7,8,9\}$.

Why are these the only two?

If the largest number of the five integers was 8, then the largest that the sum could be would be $8+7+6+5+4=30$, which is too small.  This tells us that we must include one 9 in the list.  (We cannot include any number larger than 9, since each number must be a single-digit number.)

Therefore, the sum of the remaining four numbers is $33-9=24$.

If the largest of the four remaining numbers is 7, then their largest possible sum would be $7+6+5+4=22$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 8 in the list.

Thus, the sum of the remaining three numbers is $24-8=16$.

If the largest of the three remaining numbers is 6, then their largest possible sum would be $6+5+4=15$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 7 in the list.

Thus, the sum of the remaining two numbers is $16-7=9$.

This tells us that we need two different positive integers, each less than 7, that add to 9.  These must be 3 and 6 or 4 and 5.

This gives us the two lists above, and shows that they are the only two such lists.  The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3=\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\dfrac{125}{216}=\boxed{\dfrac{91}{216}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since a multiple of 196 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 7, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 7. For one thing, 98 can be paired with any even number as it has 1 factor of 2, since $98=2 \cdot 7^2$ takes care of all the other primes. So, 98 can be paired with 2, 4, 12, 14, and 28, for 5 pairs. Then, 28 can be paired with (excluding 98 which we already counted) 21 and 14, both of which have the necessary factor of 7, giving us 2 more pairs. There are no remaining pairs of numbers 21 and smaller that are multiples of 196, because the only pair with two factors of 7, $\{14, 21 \}$, has a factor of 2 but not 4. So, there are $5+2=7$ pairs. And in total, there are ${7 \choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\frac{7}{21} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\pi \cdot 6^2 = 36\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\pi \cdot 4^2 - \pi \cdot 2^2 = 12 \pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\pi - 12\pi = 24\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\frac{24\pi}{36\pi}=\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \boxed{6}$.

The number $ad-bc$ is even if and only if $ad$ and $bc$ are both odd or are both even.  Each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd if both of its factors are odd, and even otherwise. Exactly half of the integers from 0 to 2007 are odd, so  each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd with probability $(1/2)\cdot(1/2) = 1/4$ and are even with probability $3/4$. Hence the probability that $ad-bc$ is even is \[

We then count the odd terms of the sequence. Subtract $3$ from the list to get $4,$ $8,$ $12,$ $\ldots,$ $92,$ then divide by $4$ to get $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\ldots,$ $23.$ So this list has ${23}$ numbers.

There are 23 numbers in the list. 

Explanation: We can get the number of terms in this list by counting using the formula for an arithmetic sequence. The first term is 6, the common difference is 1, and the last term is 98. Using the formula, we have:

$$n = \frac{98 - 6}{1} + 1 = 93 + 1 = 94$$

So, there are 94 terms in the sequence. However, we only want to count the terms that are multiples of 3. Starting with 6, every third term will be a multiple of 3. Thus, we have:

$$23 = \frac{94}{3}$$

So there are 23 numbers in the list that are multiples of 3.

The last house number on the south side of the street is $4 \cdot 50-3=197$, and the first house number on the north side is $2$. Since these sets are arithmetic sequences, each term is the average of its two adjacent terms, so the total number of digits painted is $$2\cdot T_n, \qquad\qquad(1)$$ where $T_n$ is the $50\text{th}$ triangular number. The last digit of this is $5$ and it has $50-4 = 46$ extra $5$s in the remaining slot of the two-digit numbers. Following the pattern gives forty-six $0$s, forty-six $2$s, etc., down to one $9$, for a total of $$46+44+42+\cdots+4+2+1.$$


Using the formula $1+2+\cdots+k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}$, this sum is $$\frac{23\cdot24}{2}=12\cdot23=276.$$ Therefore, the total number of digits painted is $$2\cdot\frac{50\cdot51}{2}+276=5100+276= \boxed{5376}$$

We first note that each circle can intersect any other circle a maximum of two times.

To begin, the first circle is drawn. The second circle is then drawn overlapping the first, and two points of intersection are created. Since each pair of circles overlap (but are not exactly on top of one another), then the third circle drawn can intersect the first circle twice and the second circle twice. We continue in this manner with each new circle drawn intersecting each of the previously drawn circles exactly twice. That is, the third circle drawn intersects each of the two previous circles twice, the fourth circle intersects each of the three previous circles twice, and so on.  Diagrams showing possible arrangements for $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ circles, each giving the maximum number of intersections, are shown below.

[asy]
draw((Circle((-6,.2),1)));
draw((Circle((-5,.2),1)));
draw((Circle((-5.5,1.2-sqrt(3)),1)));
draw((Circle((-2,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-2,0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-.5,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-.5,0.3),1)));

draw((Circle((3.6,.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2,.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2.3,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((3.3,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2.8,.8),1)));
[/asy]


The resulting numbers of intersections are summarized in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
Circles&New intersections&Total number of intersections\\ \hline
1&0&0\\ \hline
2&2&2\\ \hline
3&$2\times2=4$&$2+4$\\ \hline
4&$3\times2=6$&$2+4+6$\\ \hline
5&$4\times2=8$&$2+4+6+8$\\ \hline
6&$5\times2=10$&$2+4+6+8+10$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Continuing in this vein, the greatest possible total number of intersection points using ten circles is\[2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16+18=\boxed{90}.\] Or, we notice that every unique pair of circles carries at most two unique intersections. There are $\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10\cdot 9}{2!} = 45$ different pairs of circles, which give a total of $2\cdot 45 = \boxed{90}$ possible intersections.

To be complete, we technically need to show that this number is possible, though we don't expect students to do this to answer the question. The diagram below demonstrates a possible positioning of the ten circles that achieves the maximum $90$ points of intersection. That is, every pair of circles intersects exactly twice and all points of intersection are distinct from one another. It is interesting to note that this diagram is constructed by positioning each of the ten circles' centres at one of the ten vertices of a suitably sized regular decagon, as shown.

With the original format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first three slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last three. Therefore, there are $26^3 \cdot 10^3$ license plates possible. With the new format, any one of 26 letters can be used for each of the first four slots, and any one of 10 digits can be used for each of the last two: thus, there are now $26^4 \cdot 10^2$ license plates possible. Subtracting the two yields an answer of $26^3 \cdot 10^2 \cdot (26 - 10)$, which equals $\boxed{28121600}$.

When we expand this out, we get a bunch of terms with $\sqrt7$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we do the following trick: Add $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\sqrt7=\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\cdot5^3\cdot(2\sqrt7)+6\cdot5^2\cdot(2\sqrt7)^2+4\cdot5\cdot(2\sqrt7)^3+(2\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\cdot5^3\cdot(2\sqrt7)+6\cdot5^2\cdot(2\sqrt7)^2-4\cdot5\cdot(2\sqrt7)^3+(2\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\cdot5^2(2\sqrt7)^2+(2\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\sqrt7)^4$.

Note that at least one of the boxes must be a $1$-piece box, because the number of chocolates ordered was odd. The problem is now to determine how many ways $14$ pieces can be assembled using the $1$, $2$, and $4$-piece boxes. If we begin with all $1$-piece boxes, there's one way to do that. There are seven ways to have a mix of $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (one $2$-piece, two $2$-pieces, etc. all the way through seven $2$-pieces). Now, each pair of $2$-piece boxes can be replaced by a $4$-piece box. If there is one $4$-piece box, there are six ways to box the remaining ten pieces of chocolate with $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (no $2$-pieces, one $2$-piece, etc. all the way through five $2$-pieces). If there are two $4$-piece boxes, there are four ways to box the remaining six pieces of chocolate (zero through three $2$-piece boxes). Finally, if there are three $4$-piece boxes, there are two ways to box the remaining two pieces of chocolate (either no $2$-piece boxes or one $2$-piece box). Thus, there are a total of $1 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{20}$ combinations of boxes possible.

The only way in which there won't be two dice displaying the same number is if exactly one number between 1 and 6 isn't being displayed on any of the dice and the 5 dice all display different numbers. There are 6 different possibilities for the number that isn't being displayed, and then there are a total of $5!$ ways in which the 5 dice displaying different numbers can be arranged, so there are a total of $6\cdot5!$ outcomes that result in the dice all displaying different numbers. Since each of the 5 dice can have 6 results when rolled and all of the rolls are determined independently, there are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\dfrac{6\cdot5!}{6^5}=\dfrac{5}{54}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\dfrac{5}{54}=\boxed{\dfrac{49}{54}}$.

There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.

Consider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.

In the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.

So there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house.

We see that it's easier to count the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes and perfect fifth powers less than $33^{2}=1089$. We see there are 32 perfect squares less than 1089, which are $1^2$, $2^2$, $\ldots$, $32^2$ and then there are 10 perfect cubes which are $1^3$, $\ldots$, $10^3$. There are 4 perfect fifth powers less than 1089 which are $1^5$, $\ldots$, $4^5$. Then notice there are 3 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes which are 1, $2^{6} = 64$ and $3^{6} = 729$. There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$. So within the first 1089 positive integers we need to get rid of $32+10+4-3-2-1+1 =41$ integers which means the $1000^{\text{th}}$ term is $1000+41 = \boxed{1041}$.

Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\frac{10}{120} = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\heartsuit$ or $\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \[ E_1 = \frac{1}{13}(\$1+\$2+\cdots+\$10+(3\times\$20)) = \$\frac{115}{13}. \]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \[ E = \frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\$\frac{805}{52}}, \]or about $\boxed{\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.

In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.  We can choose 3 men from the 30 men total in $$ \binom{30}{3} = \frac{30 \times 29 \times 28}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 4,\!060 $$ways, and 4 women from the 40 women total in $$ \binom{40}{4} = \frac{40 \times 39 \times 38 \times 37}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 91,\!390 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \binom{30}{3}\binom{40}{4} = (4,\!060)(91,\!390) = \boxed{371,\!043,\!400}. $$

Given any pair of the 4 CDs, there is exactly one arrangement with only these two CDs in the correct cases, because each of the remaining two CDs must be in the case of the other one.  Therefore, there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ arrangements of the CDs for which exactly two of the CDs are in the correct case.  The probability that one of these 6 arrangements will be chosen from among the $4!=24$ equally likely arrangements is $\dfrac{6}{24}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}$.

First, we can count the number of ways to arrange the letters.  There are $5$ choices for the first letter, since it must be a vowel.  This leaves $25$ possibilities for the second letter, since there are no repeats, and then $24$ possibilities for the third letter, for a total of: $$5\times25\times24=3000\text{ letter arrangements}$$Next, we can count the number of ways to arrange the digits.  There are $4$ possible choices for the first digit, corresponding to the four elements of the set $\{1,2,4,6\}$.  This leaves $9$ remaining choices for the next digit, and $8$ choices for the last digit, a total of: $$4\times9\times8=288\text{ digit arrangements}$$Since the digits and letters can be arranged independently, the total number of license plates will be: $$3000\times288=\boxed{864000}$$

We split the problem into two cases.

Case I: A red ball is removed. The probability that a red ball is removed is $\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$. After it is replaced by a white ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3}$.

Case II: A white ball is removed. The probability that a white ball is removed is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. After it is replaced by a red ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is $\frac{5}{6}$. Thus, the probability that a red ball will be drawn in this case is $\frac{5}{18}$.

We add the two probabilities for a total probability of $\boxed{\frac{11}{18}}$.

The probability that two particular dice will show 1's, two particular dice will show 2's, and the other two dice will show neither of those is $\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{4}{6}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{2916}$. There are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to select two out of the 6 dice to be 1's and $\binom{4}{2}=6$ to select two dice out of the remaining four to show 2's, which means that there are a total of $15\cdot6=90$ ways of selecting which dice will be 1's and 2's.

More generally, suppose coin $A$ is tossed $n + 1$ times and coin $B$ is tossed $n$ times.

Consider the situation when coin $A$ has been tossed $n$ times and coin $B$ has been tossed $n$ times.  At this point, in terms of heads, either $A$ is ahead of $B,$ $B$ is ahead of $A,$ or they are tied.  Let $p$ be the probability that $A$ is ahead of $B.$  Then by symmetry, $p$ is the probability that $B$ is ahead of $A,$ so the probability of a tie is $1 - 2p.$

Now coin $A$ is tossed one more time.  If coin $A$ ends up with more heads, then either it was ahead before the last flip (which occurs with probability $p$), or it was tied before the last flip and got heads for the last flip (which occurs with probability $(1 - 2p) \cdot \frac{1}{2}$).  Therefore, the probability that coins $A$ ends up with more heads is
\[p + (1 - 2p) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]

Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.

Now we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.

There are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\frac{3015}{4005} = \boxed{\frac{67}{89}}$.

There are 30 ways to draw the first white ball, 29 ways to draw the second, and 28 ways to draw the third.

To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ such $n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If a triangle with sides of length 1, $x$, and $y$ exists, the triangle inequality must be satisfied, which states that $x+y>1$, $1+x>y$, and $1+y>x$.  We can draw a plane with $x$ and $y$ axes and shade in the area where all of these inequalities are satisfied.

draw((0,0)--(0,3));

draw((.1,2)--(-.1,2));

draw((0,1)--(2,3));

[/asy]

The total area of the square is $3^2=9$.  The area of the unshaded region is $2^2+1/2=9/2$.  Thus, the shaded area is $9/2$ and the probability that such a triangle exists is $(9/2)/9=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

We want to deal with the restriction first.

Without worrying about which specific boys and girls go in which seats, in how many ways can the girls sit together?

There are 5 basic configurations of boys and girls:  $$GGGBBBB, BGGGBBB, BBGGGBB,$$ $$BBBGGGB, BBBBGGG$$ where $B$ is a boy and $G$ is a girl.  Then, within each configuration, there are $4!$ ways in which we can assign the 4 sons to seats, and $3!$ ways in which we can assign the 3 daughters to seats.

Therefore the number of possible seatings is $5 \times 4! \times 3! = \boxed{720}$.

The total area of the target is $\pi\cdot 10^2=100\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\pi\cdot 4^2=16\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\pi \cdot 8^2 - \pi \cdot 6^2 = 28\pi$.  The total shaded area is $16\pi+28\pi=44\pi$.  The probability a dart will hit a shaded region is equal to $\frac{44\pi}{100\pi}=\boxed{\frac{11}{25}}$.

For $1\times3$ rectangles, the upper left unit square of the rectangle must be in one of the leftmost four columns and can be in any row, giving 24 possible locations. Similarly, there are 24 possible locations for a $3\times1$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 3 which can be formed is $\boxed{48}$.

To visit all four points, we notice that we must travel along at least three different segments. The sum of the shortest three segments is $3+4+5=12$, but we quickly notice that it is impossible to start at one point and visit the other three points by traveling on a path with length $12$ ($DB$, $BC$, and $CD$ do not let us visit point $A$, and it is not possible to travel on $AD$, $CD$, and $BD$ in a continuous path). We now look for a path with length $13$ and notice that traveling from point $A$ to $D$ to $B$ to $C$ works. Alternatively, $B$ to $D$ to $C$ to $A$ also works. Both paths have length $\boxed{13}$.

There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\dfrac{\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \dfrac{252}{1024} = \dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{63}{256}\right)=\boxed{\frac{193}{512}} $$

Rotate each bracelet so the teal bead is at the top. If we flip a bracelet over, leaving the teal bead in place, the three beads on the left flip to the right, and vice-versa. We can flip all of the bracelets so there are more orange beads on the left than on the right, since there are an odd number of orange beads total. If there are 2 orange beads on the left, there are three choices for the position of the black bead on the left and 3 for the position of the orange bead on the right, making 9 bracelets. If all three beads on the left are orange, we get one more bracelet, for a total of $9+1=\boxed{10}$ bracelets.

The shaded region represents the times that Annie and Xenas would see each other at the party.  For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{4}=\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\frac{25}{16}=\frac{64-25}{16}= \frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \boxed{\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The sample space of all possible outcomes is $$|\Omega| = {5\choose 2}\cdot 10 = 100.$$Therefore, we need to count the number of outcomes such that Sergio's number is greater than the sum of the two numbers chosen by Tina. 

If Tina chooses 1 and 2, Sergio must choose a number from $\{4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}$. There are 7 such choices for Sergio, and since Tina can choose her numbers in $\binom{5}{2}=10$ different ways, there are a total of $7\cdot 10 = 70$ ways that satisfy this condition.

If Tina chooses 1 and 3, Sergio must choose a number from $\{5,6,7,8,9,10\}$, and there are 6 such choices. There are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose the numbers for Tina, therefore this case gives us $6\cdot 10 = 60$ outcomes.

If Tina chooses 1 and 4, then Sergio must choose a number from $\{6,7,8,9,10\}$, and there are 5 such choices. The number of ways to choose the numbers for Tina is 10, so this case gives us $5\cdot 10 = 50$ outcomes.

If Tina chooses 1 and 5, then Sergio must choose a number from $\{7,8,9,10\}$, so there are 4 possible choices for Sergio. Thus, there are $4\cdot 10 = 40$ possible outcomes in this case.

If Tina chooses 2 and 3, Sergio must choose a number from $\{6,7,8,9,10\}$, giving us $5\cdot 10=50$ outcomes. 

If Tina chooses 2 and 4, then Sergio must choose a number from $\{7,8,9,10\}$, giving us $4\cdot 10 = 40$ outcomes.

If Tina chooses 2 and 5, then Sergio must choose a number from $\{8,9,10\}$, so there are 3 possible choices for Sergio, and there are $3\cdot 10 = 30$ possible outcomes in this case.

If Tina chooses 3 and 4, Sergio must choose a number from $\{8,9,10\}$, giving us $3\cdot 10 = 30$ outcomes.

If Tina chooses 3 and 5, Sergio must choose a number from $\{9,10\}$, so there are 2 possible choices for Sergio, giving us $2\cdot 10 = 20$ possible outcomes.

Finally, if Tina chooses 4 and 5, then Sergio must choose a number from $\{10\}$, so there are 1 possible choice for Sergio, and this case gives us $1\cdot 10 = 10$ outcomes.

Therefore, the total number of outcomes that satisfy the condition is $70+60+50+40+50+40+30+20+10=370.$ The probability of getting such an outcome is therefore $\dfrac{370}{1000}=\boxed{0.37}$.

To begin, consider the number of ways to arrange the three countries around the circle.  We can consider the English representatives a block, the Germans another block, and the French a third block.  There are $(3-1)!=2$ ways to arrange these three blocks around a circle.  We can also see this by simply drawing the two possible arrangements: [asy]

label("F",(-.75,-1));
label("G",(.75,-1));

[/asy] Within the English group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the three representatives.  Similarly, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Germans and $2!$ ways to arrange the French representatives.

Extracting Answer from: 
Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\frac{5}{9}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.

There are 4 ways to pick the first girl and 3 ways to pick the second one; however, this counts each pair of girls twice since selecting girl A followed by girl B is the same as selecting girl B followed by girl A, so the total number of ways to pick the girls is $\frac{4\times3}{2}=6$. Similarly, there are 7 ways to pick the first boy, 6 ways to pick the second one, and 5 ways to pick the last one, but this counts each combination of boys 6 times since picking any of the three boys first followed by either of the other two followed by the third one will give the same triplet of boys. So the total number of ways to pick the boys is $\frac{7\times6\times5}{3\times2}=35$, and the total of number of ways to pick the students for the group presentation is $\frac{4\times3}{2}\cdot \frac{7\times6\times5}{3\times2}=\boxed{210}$

We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}$, or $\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\frac{1}{18} = \boxed{\frac{17}{18}}$.

First, suppose that the dart lands between $A$ and $B$.  It then has a probability of 1/2 of being closer to $A$ than to $B$, and it is always closer to $B$ than it is to $C$, so it is closer to $B$ than it is to $A$ and $C$ with probability 1/2.

On the other hand, if it lands between $B$ and $C$, then it is definitely closer to $B$ than to $A$, and it has a probability of 1/2 of being closer to $B$ than to $C$.  As before, it is closer to $B$ than it is to $A$ and $C$ with probability ${1/2}$.

If Polya is never to visit the sixth floor after she begins, we know that her first stop is at the seventh floor. Moreover, her second stop must be at the eighth floor. She has three moves left, and the only way she can ever visit the 6th floor from the 8th floor in three remaining moves is to go down in both of the following two steps. The probability of getting to the eighth step in two moves is $\frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}$. And the probability of not going downward in the next two steps is $1- \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. So the overall probability of never hitting the sixth floor after the beginning is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{16}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
We must find the probability that Joan can solve it at any time before the sixth try, so it is the sum of the probabilities that she will solve it on her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth tries.  We could evaluate all those cases, but seeing all that casework, we wonder if it will be easier to find the probability that she fails to solve it before 6 tries, and subtract the result from 1.

In order for her to fail to solve it before her sixth try, she must fail 5 times.  The probability of failure on each try is $1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$, so the probability that she fails on each of her first 5 tries is $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5 = \frac{243}{1024}$.  Therefore, the probability that she succeeds before her sixth try is \[1-\frac{243}{1024} = \boxed{\frac{781}{1024}}.\]

We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{36} = \boxed{\frac{11}{36}}$.

First, a solution with a Venn diagram: [asy]size(230);
import graph;
pair A = (0,-1); pair B = (sqrt(3)/2,1/2); pair C = (-sqrt(3)/2,1/2);
draw(Circle(A,1.2) ^^ Circle(B,1.2) ^^ Circle(C,1.2));
label(" 5",A); label("10",B); label("11",C); label("$12$",(0,0)); label("$19$",(B+C)/2); label("$8$",(A+B)/2); label("$17$",(A+C)/2);
label("Math",2.4C,C); label("English",2.4B,B); label("Science", 2.4A,A);[/asy] We build this diagram by working from the inside out.  First, we put the 12 in the middle for the 12 students who do all three subjects.  We then take care of the other 3 overlap regions by subtracting this 12 from each of the totals of students who did a pair of subjects.  Finally, we can find out the number of students who did only math by subtracting from 59 (the number of students who did math homework) the numbers in the math-and-other-subjects overlaps.  We can then do the same for the other subjects.  Adding all the numbers in the diagram, we see that there are 82 students who did some homework, so there are $100-82=\boxed{18}$ who did no homework at all.

Alternatively, we could solve this problem by first adding the number of students for each subject.  But students who do two subjects are counted twice, so we subtract the doubles (students doing homework for 2 subjects).  Now, we've added the students who did all three subjects three times (adding them in for each subject) and we've subtracted them three times (once for each "double" a student who did all three subjects is in).  So, we haven't counted them at all!  So, we have to add these "triples" back in!  This gives a total of  $$59+49+42-20-29-31+12=82$$ students.

Extracting Answer from: 
The color of the center square is unrestricted, so we can call that color 1.

If, without loss of generality, we assign color 2 to the top left corner, the vertical line of symmetry forces the top right square to also be color 2, and the diagonal line of symmetry forces the bottom right square to be color 2, which then, by the vertical line of symmetry, forces the bottom left square to be color 2.

Finally, if, without loss of generality, we assign color 3 to the top middle square, the diagonal line of symmetry forces the right middle square to be color 3, which then, by the vertical line of symmetry, forces the left middle square to be color 3, and this then forces the bottom middle square to also be color 3, by the diagonal line of symmetry. Thus, at most $\boxed{3}$ colors may be used.

It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.

The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors. If the number has no factors of 3, the qualifying numbers are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ for 7 total. If there is one factor of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^1, 2^1 \cdot 3^1, 2^2 \cdot 3^1, 2^3 \cdot 3^1, 2^4 \cdot 3^1, 2^5 \cdot 3^1$ for 6 total. With two factors of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^2, 2^1 \cdot 3^2, 2^2 \cdot 3^2, 2^3 \cdot 3^2$ for 4 total. With three factors of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^3, 2^1 \cdot 3^3$ for 2 total. Finally, $3^4$ gives us 1 more. So, there are $7+ 6+4+2+1 = 20$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have only 2 and 3 as prime factors. Therefore, there are $100-20 = \boxed{80}$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.

We pretend that the letters are all different, and we have P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$.  We have $4!$ permutations (since all the letters are different).

But how many arrangements of P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$ (where the P's and A's are considered different) correspond to a single arrangement of PAPA (where the P's and A's are identical)?  PAPA is counted in 4 different ways: as P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$, P$_1$A$_2$P$_2$A$_1$, P$_2$A$_1$P$_1$A$_2$, and P$_2$A$_2$P$_1$A$_1$.  Rather than list out the possibilities, we could have reasoned as follows: For the 2 P's, each possibility is counted $2! = 2$ times, and for the 2 A's, each of these 2 possibilities is counted $2! = 2$ times, for a total of $2 \times 2 = 4$ ways. (Make sure you see why it isn't $2+2 = 4$ ways.) Therefore, there are 4! ways to arrange the 4 letters P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$; this counts each arrangement of PAPA $2! \times 2! = 4$ times, so we have $4!/(2! \times 2!) = \boxed{6}$ ways to arrange PAPA.

There are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ pairs of circles that can be picked. Each pair of circles can have at most two intersection points, so a maximum of $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ intersection points are possible. However, we must check if all 4 circles can intersect at a single point. If so, then this needs to be added to the count. Suppose the four circles intersect at point P. Then there are at least ${4 \choose 1} = 4$ circles that intersect at P, so we can have a maximum of $12+1=13$ intersection points in total. Answer: $\boxed{13}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3} \right\rfloor$.  (The notation $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3}\right\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{9} \right\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3}\right\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.

The sum is $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{27} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{81} \right\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \boxed{97}$.

If the number is divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$.  So $a+b$ must be one more than a multiple of $3$, since $5$ is one less than a multiple of $3$.  We have several options:

If $a+b=1$, it must be $(1,0)$, one possibility.

For $a+b=4$, $a$ can be $1$ to $4$, for four possibilities.

For $a+b=7$, $a$ can be $1$ to $7$, so seven possibilities.

For $a+b=10$, anything from $(1,9)$ to $(9,1)$ works, so nine possibilities.

For $a+b=13$, the pairs range from $(4,9)$ to $(9,4)$, for six possibilities.

If $a+b=16$, we can have $(7,9)$, $(8,8)$, or $(9,7)$, so three possibilities.

$a+b=19$ and up is not possible.

There are $\binom{7}{4}=35$ ways to choose 4 of the islands. For each choice, there is a probability of $\left( \frac{1}{5} \right)^4 \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^3$ that those 4 islands will have treasure and the others will not.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a total of $\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ ways to choose two distinct vertices.  When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.

Therefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\frac{100}{190}=\boxed{\frac{10}{19}}$$

Let the two random numbers be $x$ and $y$. In order to form an obtuse triangle, since 1 will be the longest side, we must simultaneously satisfy the following inequalities: $$x+y>1\text{ and }x^2+y^2<1.$$The first is the triangle inequality and the second guarantees that the triangle is obtuse. Graphing these in the $xy$-plane, we get the following shaded region. [asy]

We have enough information to solve for the size of each team. There are $\dfrac{60}{2}=30$ members of the basketball team, $\dfrac{4}{3}(30)=40$ members of the math team, and $\dfrac{2}{3}(30)=20$ members of the soccer team. Adding these up gives us 90, so clearly we're overcounting since there are only 60 students. The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on. This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times. Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$. However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\boxed{14}$.

This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\left(\dfrac{2}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\left(\dfrac{3}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\left(\dfrac{4}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\dfrac{1}{100}+\dfrac{4}{100}+\dfrac{9}{100}+\dfrac{16}{100}=\frac{30}{100}=\boxed{\dfrac{3}{10}}$.

There are  $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $4$ spins will come up red. Each spin has a $1/4$ chance of coming up red, and $3/4$ chance of not coming up red, so once we pick which $2$ spins we want to come up red, there is a $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\!2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\!2}$ chance that the two spins we pick come up red and the other two do not. So, there is a $$6\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\!2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\!2}=\frac{27}{128}$$chance that exactly $2$ come up red.

There are  $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to pick which 3 of the 4 spins will point to an arm. Each spin has a $1/2$ chance of pointing to an arm, and $1/2$ chance of not pointing to an arm, so once we pick which $3$ spins we want to point to an arm, there is a $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!1}$ chance that the three spins we pick come up arm and the other one does not. So, there is a $$4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!1} = \frac{1}{4}$$chance that exactly $3$ spins point to an arm.

The color selection and limb selection are independent events, so the probability that they both happen is the product of their individual probabilities; $\frac{27}{128} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{27}{512}}$.

The probability that a single spin lands on a red spot is $\frac{1}{4}$, and we need to consider the probability that a spin lands on a red spot versus a non-red spot.

The probability that the 2 of the 4 spins land on red spots is $\binom{4}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2$, as there are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose which 2 of the 4 spins land on red spots.

The probability that 3 of the 4 spins require moving an arm is $\binom{4}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$, as there are $\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose which 3 of the 4 spins require moving an arm, each with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, and the non-arm move must be the fourth spin.

Combining these probabilities, the probability that we seek is

$$\binom{4}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2\cdot\binom{4}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)~=~\boxed{\frac{3}{32}}.$$

To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$, we can find the coefficient in each of the 4th powers. These are the only things that can contribute $x^2y^2$ terms to the final expansion.

The expansion of $(x+y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$, by the Binomial Theorem.

The expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.

Thus the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ will be $\binom{4}{2}+4\binom{4}{2}=\boxed{30}$.

There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\boxed{0}$.

The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls.

Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.

If all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.

If $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.

If $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.

If $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.

If $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.

If $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.

If $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.

In total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.

See if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.

The first digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Whatever the first digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be.  If we are going to have an even integer, the units digit must be even.  This restricts the first digit to 2, 4 or 6.  Then, there are 10 choices for the next (thousands) digit. That fixes what the tens digit can be.  Finally, there are 10 choices for the third (hundreds) digit.  So, we can construct $3\times10\times10= \boxed{300}$ palindromes by choosing the digits.

The probability that Phillip flips $k$ heads is $$\binom8k\left(\frac23\right)^k\left(\frac13\right)^{8-k}=\frac1{3^8}\binom8k2^k,$$  since there are $\binom{8}{k}$ ways that $k$ out of $8$ coins will come up heads, and each of these arrangements of $k$ heads out of $8$ coins occurs with probability $\left(\frac23\right)^k\left(\frac13\right)^{8-k}$.   Therefore, the ratio of the two probabilities in the problem is equal to $$\frac{\binom832^3}{\binom822^2}=\frac{8\cdot7\cdot6}{3\cdot2\cdot1}\cdot\frac{2\cdot1}{8\cdot7}\cdot\frac{2^3}{2^2}=\frac{6}{3}\cdot2=\boxed{4}.$$

The point can be randomly selected anywhere inside the orange square, which has area $10\cdot10=100$. The point satisfies the given inequality if it lies within the shaded region (the diagonal side of the shaded region is a segment of the line $2x+5y=20$). We will find its area by subtracting the area of the non-shaded region from the area of the square. The non-shaded region is a triangle with base of length 10 and height of length 4, so its area is $\frac{10\cdot4}{2}=20$. The area of the shaded region is then $100-20=80$. So the probability that the point falls within the shaded region is $80/100=\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The line $2x + 5y = 20$ passes through $(10,0)$ and $(0,4)$. The region bounded by the axes and the line $2x+5y = 20$ is an isosceles trapezoid.

The height of this trapezoid is the distance between the $x$-axis and the line $2x+5y = 20$. Solving the equation $2x+5y=20$ for $y$ gives $y=\frac{20-2x}{5}$. Thus, the $y$-intercept of this line is $\frac{20}{5}=4$, so the height of the trapezoid is $4$.

The parallel sides of the trapezoid have lengths of $10$ and $4$, so its area is $\frac{1}{2}(10+4)(4)=28$. The square has an area of $10\times 10=100$.

Therefore, the probablity the point is in the trapezoid is $\frac{28}{100}=\boxed{\frac{7}{25}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's try counting the number of perfect squares and cubes less than $441=21^2$. There are twenty perfect squares less than 441: $1^2, 2^2, \ldots, 20^2$. There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.

But wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes. Thus, the $400^{\text{th}}$ term is $\boxed{425}$.

Thus the sum of the elements of the $k$th row, for $k \le n$, is $2^k$, so the total sum of all the elements of the previous rows is \[\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \frac{2^n-1}{2-1} = 2^n-1\] by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, $f(n)=2^n-(2^n-1)=1$ for all $n \ge 2015$. (That is, it is a constant!) Thus, the minimum value is clearly $\boxed{1}$.

The given expression is the expansion of $(101-1)^3$. In general, the expansion of $(a-b)^3$ is equal to  \[a^3-3\cdot a^2\cdot b+3\cdot a\cdot b^2-b^3\]

In this case, $a=101,b=1$. Thus $101^3-3\cdot 101^2+3\cdot 101-1=(101-1)^3$; we can easily calculate $100^3=\boxed{1000000}$.

There are $5!$ ways to arrange 5 beads in a line.  Since there are 5 rotations in a circle for each of these arrangements, we must divide by 5, and since there are two matching reflections for each arrangement, we must divide by 2.  So there are $\dfrac{5!}{5 \times 2} = \boxed{12}$ ways.

Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\cdot 4\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.

Solution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \boxed{960}$.

Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\boxed{\frac{73}{100}}$.

Because 17 is between $5\times3=15$ and $6\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2=\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\times9=288$ and $33\times9=297$ and thus that $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\boxed{27}$ integers.

A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\frac{10}{100} = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

The prime numbers from 1 to 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on any one die is equal to $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$, since there is an equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6. Since the two dice are independent, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on either die is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

To make such a number, we'd start with the last digit. We'd then consider different combinations of the first two digits that give us this sum.  We always have $10$ choices for the third digit. \[
\begin{array}{|c|c|}\hline
\text{Last digit} & \text{First two digits} \\ \hline
0 & - \\ \hline
1 & 10 \\ \hline

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{21}(1) + \frac{2}{21}(2) + \cdots + \frac{6}{21}(6) = \frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots 6^2}{21} = \boxed{\frac{13}{3}}. \]

There are $\binom{12}{5}=792$ equally likely choices for the set of 5 CDs Carlos purchases.  Of these, $\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.  Therefore,  \[
\binom{9}{5}+\binom{8}{5}+\binom{7}{5}-1=126+56+21-1=202
\] of the sets of 5 CDs do not include at least one CD from each category.  Subtracting from 792, we find that 590 of the sets do include at least one CD from each category.  The probability that a chosen randomly set will be one of these is $\dfrac{590}{792}=\boxed{\frac{295}{396}}$.

We can choose two numbers in $\binom{99}{2}=4851$ ways. Two numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 3 if at least one of them is a multiple of 3. We can more easily count the number of ways for the product to not be a multiple of 3: this happens when neither of the numbers is a multiple of 3. There are $\frac{99}{3}=33$ multiples of 3 less than 100, and $99-33=66$ numbers which aren't multiples of 3. The number of ways to choose two of these numbers is $\binom{66}{2}=2145$, so the number of way to choose two numbers where at least one is a multiple of 3 is $4851-2145=2706$. The final probability is $\frac{2706}{4851}=\boxed{\frac{82}{147}}$.

The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{9}$.  In total, the probability that the log reaches B is $\dfrac{1}{6}+\dfrac{1}{9}=\boxed{\frac{5}{18}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:

Case 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.

Case 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.

Putting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \boxed{144}$ seatings.

Every positive integer appears at least once; if we consider an arbitrary integer $k$, it can be written in the form $\binom{k}{1}$. Almost all integers can be written twice, because $\binom{k}{1} = \binom{k}{k-1} = k$, but when $k-1 = 1$, the two occurrences overlap into one. This takes place for $k = 2$, and $2$ only appears once in Pascal's Triangle, because succeeding rows of Pascal's Triangle only contain $1$'s and numbers greater than $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\boxed{1}$.

We need to choose 3 parents out of 7, which gives $\dbinom{7}{3}=35$ ways to choose the parents.  Finally, we choose the students.  There are 3 students chosen from 6, which gives $\dbinom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose the students.

We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to use casework. Suppose first that bag A is chosen: there is a $1/2$ chance of this occurring. There are ${5 \choose 2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10$ total ways to select two balls from bag A. If the two balls are the same color, then they must be either both white or both red. If both are white, then there are ${3\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the two white balls, and if both are red, then there is $1$ way to pick the two red balls. Thus, the probability of selecting two balls of the same color from bag A is $\frac{1+3}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$.

Next, suppose that bag B is chosen, again with $1/2$ chance. There are ${9 \choose 2} = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2} = 36$ ways to pick the two balls. There are ${6 \choose 2} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = 15$ ways to pick two white balls, and ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick two red balls. Thus, the probability that two balls drawn from bag B are the same color is equal to $\frac{15+3}{36} = \frac 12$.

Thus, the probability that the balls have the same color is $\frac 12 \cdot \frac 25 + \frac 12 \cdot \frac 12 = \boxed{\frac 9{20}}$.

There are $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to answer the questions on the true/false test. However, we can also compute the number of ways of answering the questions on the true/false test by using combinations; there are $\binom{10}{k}$ ways to answer $k$ of the questions on the test with a false, so we have: $$\binom{10}{0} + \binom{10}{1} + \cdots + \binom{10}{9} + \binom{10}{10} = 2^{10}.$$ The desired answer is \begin{align*}
&\binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{4} + \cdots + \binom{10}{9} + \binom{10}{10} \\

Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.

Extracting Answer from: 
The number of ways to choose one white ball and one black ball is $5k$, since there are 5 choices for the white ball and $k$ choices for the black ball.  The number of ways to pick any 2 balls out of $(k+5)$ balls is $\dbinom{k+5}{2}=\dfrac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}$.  So we have to solve for $k$ in the equation \[\frac{5k}{\frac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}}=\frac{10}{21}.\]After clearing the denominators, we can simplify to $210k = 10(k+5)(k+4)$, giving the quadratic $10k^2 - 120k + 200 = 0$.  This is the same as $k^2 - 12k + 20 = 0$, which factors as $(k-2)(k-10)=0$, so its solutions are $k={2}$ or $k={10}$. Since the problem is asking for the smallest value, $\boxed{2}$ is the correct answer.

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\{1,n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\{1,2\}$, $\{1,3\}$, $\{1,4\}$, and $\{1,5\}$.  There are a total of $\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\frac{4}{10}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

Alternatively, we know that the seating arrangement is the same if it is rotated. Once the chief's spot is chosen, the rotations are eliminated.

First, notice that Crystal cannot purchase an entire meal that includes Fried Rice.  The cheapest possibility would be Fried Rice, Soda, and Cookies, which still costs 50 cents too much.  Then, looking at the Pizza option, it is not possible for Crystal to purchase Frozen Yogurt with Pizza, as that would leave only one dollar for a drink.  Thus, she can purchase 2 different meals with Pizza (Pizza, Cookies, and either drink).  Since Fish and Chips cost the same as Pizza, there are likewise 2 different possible meals with Fish and Chips.  With a Corn Dog as her entree, Crystal can buy the most expensive meal (Corn Dog, Lemonade, and Frozen Yogurt), thus, she has 4 possible meals (Corn Dog, either drink, either dessert), making for $\boxed{8\text{ meals}}$ total.

We'll start with the naive estimate that there are $5^4=625$ colorings, since there are 5 choices for the color of each square. Obviously, some colorings will be counted more than once. Consider a general coloring and the three other colorings obtained by rotating it. If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color). In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same. Therefore, the total number of distinct colorings is $$5+\frac{20}2+\frac{600}4=5+10+150=\boxed{165}.$$[asy]

It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^5=\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\cdot\dfrac{32}{6561}=\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^6\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2=\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\cdot\dfrac{4}{6561}=\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\dfrac{112}{6561}=\boxed{\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.

To divide 12 dimes into three piles with an odd number of dimes in each pile is to express 12 as a sum of three odd numbers. This is impossible to do, since $12=2\cdot6$ is even and the sum of three odd integers is odd: $(2l+1)+(2m+1)+(2n+1)=2l+2m+2n+3=2(l+m+n+1)+1$.

We know that every third whole number starting from one must be removed from the list. Since the greatest multiple of $3$ less than $100$ is $3\cdot33=99$, this gives us a total of $33$ such numbers. We then consider the multiples of four. Every fourth whole number starting from one is a multiple of four and since $4 \cdot 25=100$, this gives us $25$ such numbers. However, we also have to account for the numbers that are multiples of both $3$ and $4$ which we counted twice. These are the multiples of $12$ (the least common multiple of $3$ and $4$). Since $100 \div 12 = 8 \text{ R}4$, we know that there are $8$ multiples of both $3$ and $4$. Thus, we have $33+25-8=50$ numbers that we removed from the list. Since there were $100$ whole numbers total, this leaves us with $100-50=\boxed{50}$ whole numbers.

By the equation $$ \dbinom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} $$we have $$ \binom{11}{4} = \frac{11!}{4!7!}. $$$$ \binom{11}{4} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times1}{(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)\times (7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times1)}. $$This leaves us with just the first 4 terms of $11!$ in the numerator, and $4!$ in the denominator.  Thus: $$ \binom{11}{4} = \frac{11!}{4!7!} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \boxed{330}. $$

On her first turn, Kendra must get 10 points.  If she wants a total of 30 after three turns, she must then either get two tens in a row or a 5 and then a 15.  To get three tens in a row, she can move any direction on her first move, go in two possible directions for her second move, and go in two possible directions for her third spin, meaning her probability of success is $\frac{1}{4}$.  On the other hand, if she wants to get a 10, a 5, and a 15, she can only move left or right on her first move, further out on her second move, and then up or down on her third move, leading to a probability of success of $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$.

For the ball to end up back in the center, the ball must deflect left 4 of the 8 times, and right the other 4 times. There are $\binom{8}{4}$ ways to pick which 4 of the rows to deflect the ball left and then the other 4 to deflect it right.  Each deflection is to the left with probability $\frac12$ and to the right with probability $\frac12$, so each possible path to the bottom occurs with probability $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{\!8}$.  Thus, the probability that 4 out of 8 deflections go left and the ball goes in the middle is \[\binom{8}{4}\frac{1}{2^8}=\boxed{\frac{35}{128}}.\]

The probability that the ball goes to the left of the first peg is $\frac{1}{2}.$ Likewise, the probability that the ball goes to the right of the first peg is $\frac{1}{2}.$ So the probability that the ball lands in the second column slot is $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}.$

Now the probability that the ball ends up in the third column slot given that it started in the second column slot is again $\frac{1}{2}.$ The probability that the ball ends up in the fourth column slot given that it started in the third column slot is $\frac{1}{2}.$ And so on, until we cover all $8$ columns. Taking into account all these probabilities, the final probability that the ball lands in the middle slot is $\frac{1}{2^8}$.


Therefore, the probability that the ball lands in the middle slot is $\boxed{\frac{1}{256}}.$

If Julie includes one of the colors that cover three cupcakes, she must also include the other color that covers three cupcakes. This is because she must make ten cupcakes total, and all of the other colors cover an even number of cupcakes, so there is no way to make ten with three and some combination of even numbers. Thus, if she includes blue and violet, she has four cupcakes left to choose. There are three ways in which she can choose four cupcakes if she chooses colors that cover two (green and orange, green and yellow, or orange and yellow). Alternately, she can choose a color that covers four (red). Finally, if she doesn't include any colors that cover three cupcakes, she must choose all of the other cupcakes in order to make ten.

There are $9!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not taking rotations, reflections, and the restriction on the purple and green beads into account. We need to subtract off the number of arrangements where the purple and green beads are adjacent from this number. There are $2\cdot3=6$ horizontally adjacent pairs of locations, $3\cdot2=6$ vertically adjacent ones, and $2\cdot2+2\cdot2=8$ pairs of diagonally adjacent locations. For each of these pairs, there are two ways to put the purple and green beads in them, and $7!$ ways to put the rest of the beads on the grid, giving a total of $2(6+6+8)7!=40\cdot7!$ invalid arrangements. So, the number of valid arrangements not counting rotations and reflections is $9!-40\cdot7!=(9\cdot8-40)7!=32\cdot7!$. The grid can be rotated onto itself in four different ways, by rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. It can also be reflected onto itself in four different ways, by reflecting across its two diagonals and through horizontal and vertical lines through its center. So, the arrangements come in groups of $4+4=8$ equivalent arrangements, and the number of different arrangements is $32\cdot7!/8=4\cdot7!=\boxed{20160}$.

We can compute this a few ways, but the numbers seem small enough that we can go ahead and just compute the probability of A being selected all three days, and the probability of A being selected exactly 2 of the three days. Team A is selected on any given day with probability $\frac{2}{3}$, because there are ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ possible pairs of teams, and 2 of them contain A. So, there is a $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}$ chance of being selected all three days. Of being selected exactly twice, there is a $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot {3 \choose 2} = \frac{4}{9}$ chance. Adding these two yields $\frac{8}{27} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{8+12}{27} = \boxed{\frac{20}{27}}$.

The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\dfrac{6!}{\frac{7!}{2}} = \dfrac{2}{7}$.  So the probability that the two E's aren't next to each other is $1 - \dfrac{2}{7} = \boxed{\dfrac{5}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The solution to this question relies on finding when the product $a\cdot b$ is negative and when it is zero (neither positive or negative); by subtracting from 1 we can find what we are looking for. The product will only be negative if the two numbers have different signs, in which case one of them is negative and the other is positive. To find the probability we must integrate the area of the restrictions for $a$ and $b$ where they differ in signs and divide that by the entire possible space. Now:

1. If $a<0$, then $b>0$ in order to product a negative product.
2. If $a=0$, then the product is zero, which is neither negative nor positive.
3. If $a>0$, then $b<0$ in order to product a negative product.

The area we have to integrate is represented by the darker blue area in the figure below:

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

By doing the integral above the blue area bounded by the x-axis and the curve, we get that the area is equal to -8. The entire rectangle has an area of $4\cdot 6=24$, and therefore the probability that the product $a\cdot b$ is positive is:

$$1- \frac{8}{24} =\frac{2}{3}.$$

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.

Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \[ E_W = \frac{5}{6}\times\$8 + \frac{1}{6}\times\$500 = \$90. \]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \[ E_B = \frac{3}{4} \times \$1 + \frac{1}{4} \times \$7 = \$2.5. \]Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{5}E_W + \frac{4}{5}E_B = \frac{1}{5}(\$90) + \frac{4}{5}(\$2.5) = \boxed{\$20}. \]

Extracting Answer from: 
We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\dfrac{5\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3\times10=\boxed{\dfrac{40}{243}}$.

Alternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\dbinom{5}{2}\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3=\boxed{\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method.

In general, \[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\]

Consider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\boxed{1092}$.

We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\frac{4}{6}\cdot \frac{2}{6}=\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{2}{9}=\boxed{\frac{7}{18}}$.

The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$. [asy]

We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.

The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ whose product is odd is $\{1,3\}$.  Since there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\{1,3\}$ is $\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\dfrac{1}{6}=\boxed{\dfrac{5}{6}}$.

There is a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) ^4=\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\cdot \frac{1}{81}=\boxed{\frac{2}{27}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
One possible solution is:

{
    "probability": "3/25"
}

Explanation:

There are 3 people ordering meat brats (M), and 3 people ordering hot dogs (H), so the total number of possible orderings is:

C(4,3) * C(3,2) = 4 * 3 = 12

where C(n,k) is the number of combinations of k items taken from n items.

To count the number of orderings that have 2 meat brats and 2 hot dogs, we can first choose 2 people to order meat brats (out of 4), and then choose 2 people to order hot dogs (out of the remaining 2). The number of ways to do this is:

C(4,2) * C(2,2) = 6 * 1 = 6

So the probability is:

6/12 = 1/2^1 * 3/2^2 = 3/25

We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \[
0<b<\frac{2\pi}{3}, \quad 0<c<\frac{2\pi}{3},
\quad\text{and}\quad |b-c|<\frac{\pi}{3}.
\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\dfrac{\pi}{3}<c<b+\frac{\pi}{3}$.

Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \[
(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.

Similarly, there are 15 possible locations for a $4\times2$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 8 which can be formed is $\boxed{30}$.

We find the probability that Javier does not suffer an allergic reaction, and subtract from 1. For Javier to not suffer an allergic reaction, the server must choose wheat or white bread; turkey, roast beef, or ham; and ranch sauce. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability that Javier suffers an allergic reaction is $1-\frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

The only way for the Dora to end up at her starting point in four steps is for her to traverse the four sides of the gray square.  She can do this in two ways: clockwise and counterclockwise. The probability of each of these two paths is $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^4=\frac{1}{256}$.

Because there are 5 teachers on the committee, there are 6 non-teachers. Now, in total, we can form ${11 \choose 4} = 330$ subcomittees. The number of subcommittees with zero non-teachers is the number of subcommittees formed by the 5 teachers, totaling ${5 \choose 4} = 5$. So, the number of subcomittees with at least one non-teacher is $330 - 5 = \boxed{325}$.

To investigate this summation, we can start by looking at the first terms: $1 + 1 + (2!) \times 2 = 2 + (2!) \times 2 = 6 = 3!$. Thus, adding the next term, $6 + (3!) \times 3 = 3! + (3!) \times 3 = 4 \times 3! = 24 = 4!$. Indeed, we see from the identity $$n! + (n!) \times n = (n+1) \times n! = (n+1)!$$that the sum will be equal to $51!$. The largest prime number to divide this quantity will be the largest prime number less than or equal to $51$, which is $\boxed{47}$.

$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. In order for this fraction to be odd, neither $n$ nor $n-1$ can be divisible by $4$, because only one of $n$ and $n-1$ can be even. There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \boxed{50}$ valid integers.

The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\text{both red}) = P(\text{1st red}) \times P(\text{2nd red \textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{4}{10}\times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\text{both blue}) = P(\text{1st blue}) \times P(\text{2nd blue \textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both blue}) = \frac{6}{10}\times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \begin{align*}P(\text{both same color}) &= P(\text{both red}) + P(\text{both blue}) \\ &= \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{ \frac{7}{15}}. \end{align*}

If $\sqrt{a+\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\leq a \leq 10$, $1\leq c\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.

The arithmetic mean equals the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements in the row. In Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, row $n$ has $n+1$ elements and the sum of the elements is $2^n$, which makes the arithmetic mean $\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. Now we look for the value of $n$ that satisfies $51.2=\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. If $51.2(n+1)=2^n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer, we know that $2^n>51.2\qquad\Rightarrow n\ge 6$. If $n=6$, $2^n=64$, but $51.2(7)$ is much greater than $64$ (we can estimate $51.2(7)$ with $50\cdot7=350$). With $n=7$ and $n=8$, we also find that $51.2(n+1)$ is greater than $2^n$. When we try $n=9$, we get $51.2(10)=2^{9}=512$, which is true. The value of $n$ is $\boxed{9}$.

But we can make a similar argument about the contribution of the digits in the other places (10s, 100s, etc.), so our total sum is $528 + 5280 + \ldots + 5280000 = 528 (1 + 10 + \ldots + 10000) = 528\cdot 11,111 = \boxed{5,\!866,\!608}$.

There are five odd digits and four even digits to be used. Because the digits must alternate between odd and even, this means that there is only one possible way to distribute odds (O) and evens (E): OEOEOEOEO. Now, there are $5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2 = 120$ ways to arrange the odd numbers, as there are five choices for the first slot, four for the second, and so on. Similarly, there are $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24$ ways to arrange the even numbers. Our final answer is the product of $120$ and $24$, which is $\boxed{2880}$.

There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\dfrac{8 \times 5 \times 6!}{8} = 5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$.

There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to choose three of the dice to show prime numbers. Each roll is prime with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ and composite with probability $\frac{1}{3}$, so each arrangement of 3 prime numbers and 3 composite numbers occurs with probability $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\!3}.$ Therefore, the probability that three dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is $$20\cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{\!3}=\boxed{\frac{5}{54}}.$$

Rewrite $x+y\leq 4$ as $y\leq 4-x$.  This inequality is satisfied by the points on and under the line $y=4-x$.  Sketching this line along with the $4\times 8$ rectangle determined by the inequalities $0\leq x\leq 8$ and $0\leq y\leq 4$, we find that the points satisfying $x+y\leq 4$ are those in the shaded triangle (see figure).  The  area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$ square units, and the area of the rectangle is $(4)(8)=32$ square units, so the probability that a randomly selected point would fall in the shaded triangle is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

If every letter of ``Hawaii" were different, there would be $6! = 6\cdot 5 \cdots 2 \cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\frac{6!}{2\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 30 \cdot 6 = \boxed{180}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{6} = \boxed{20}$ triangles.

Since each person shakes hands with each other person, every pair of people will shake hands once. So, 78 represents the number of pairs, which we can count as ${n \choose 2}$ where $n$ is the number of people at the party. So, $n(n-1) = 2 \cdot 78 = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 13 = 12 \cdot 13$. So, $n=13$ gives us $\boxed{13}$ people at the party.

Consider the top left unit square. There are three different ways an L-shaped piece can cover that square:

draw((5,0)--(5,3));
[/asy]

For the first two cases, there is only one way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner. In the last case, there is no way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner without overlapping the first piece. In both of the first two cases, the two leftmost columns will be covered. So, we can use this logic again, on the top left square which has not yet been covered. We have two choices of how to cover the first two columns, two choices of how to cover the next two columns, and two choices of how to cover the last two columns, so there are $2\cdot2\cdot2=\boxed{8}$ total ways to cover the entire board.

Extracting Answer from: 
The best way to approach this problem is to use complementary counting. We already know that there are $20 \times 19 \times 18$ ways to choose the 3 officers if we ignore the restriction about Alex and Bob.  So now we want to count the number of ways that both Alex and Bob serve as officers.

For this, we will use constructive counting.  We need to pick an office for Alex, then pick an office for Bob, then put someone in the last office.  We have 3 choices for an office for Alex, either President, VP, or Treasurer.  Once we pick an office for Alex, we have 2 offices left from which to choose an office for Bob.

Once we have both Alex and Bob installed in offices, we have 18 members left in the club to pick from for the remaining vacant office.  So there are $3 \times 2 \times 18$ ways to pick officers such that Alex and Bob are both in an office.  Remember that these are the cases that we want to exclude, so to finish the problem we subtract these cases from the total number of cases.  Hence the answer is: $$ (20 \times 19 \times 18) - (3 \times 2 \times 18) = ((20 \times 19)-6) \times 18 = 374 \times 18 = \boxed{6732}. $$

Without regard to the distinguishability of the balls, they can be organized into groups of the following:  $$(4,0,0),(3,1,0),(2,2,0),(2,1,1).$$Now we consider the distinguishability of the balls in each of these options.

(4,0,0): There is only $1$ way to do this (since the boxes are indistinguishable).

(3,1,0): There are $4$ options: we must pick the ball which goes into a box by itself.

(2,2,0): There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the balls for the first box, and the remaining go in the second box.  However, the two pairs of balls are interchangeable, so we must divide by 2 to get $6 / 2 = 3$ arrangements.

(2,1,1): There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ options for picking the two balls to go in one box, and each of the other two balls goes into its own box.

The first thing to do is place the B since it has a restriction on it. We can put it anywhere but the first place, so we have 5 options. Once we have done that, we just need to place the two N's and then the rest of the spots will just be A's. We have 5 spots left, so there are 5 options for where to put the first N and 4 options for where to put the second N. However, the two N's are identical, which means that we've counted each new word twice. So our answer is $\frac{5\times5\times4}{2}=\boxed{50}$.

We can divide this into cases:

Case 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.

Case 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.

Case 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.

The total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\boxed{156}$.

Alternatively, there are $\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \begin{align*}
&1, 6, 7, 8\\
&2, 4, 6, 7\\
&2, 3, 7, 8 \\
&3, 4, 4, 7
\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \cdot 24 + 12 = \boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.

We can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{12}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{144}$. This gives us  $$y=\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{16}+\dfrac{1}{36}+\dfrac{1}{144}=\dfrac{25}{72}.$$Substituting this into $2x+y=1$ gives us $2x=\dfrac{47}{72}$, so $x=\boxed{\dfrac{47}{144}}$.

After Gimli has flipped his coin 2008 times, the probability that he has more heads than Legolas is equal the probability that Legolas has more heads than him. Call this probability $p$. Then there is a $1-2p$ probability that they have the same number of heads. If Gimli already has more heads, he will have more heads after he flips again. If he has fewer heads, he cannot have more after just one more flip. If they are even, there is a $1/2$ chance he will flip another head, and therefore have more heads. In all, Gimli flips more heads than Legolas with probability $p+\frac12(1-2p)=p+\frac12-p=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted.

The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{8}.
$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32}.
$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}.
$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$
\frac{1}{8}+ \frac{3}{32}+ \frac{1}{16}= \boxed{\frac{9}{32}}.

We have $8$ choices for president, $7$ choices for vice-president, and $6$ choices for treasurer, for a total of $8\times7\times6 = 336$ choices. Now we have to subtract the number of choices that don't satisfy the requirement, where the $3$ officers are all boys or all girls. For either case, we have $4$ choices for president, $3$ choices of vice-president, and $2$ choices for treasurer, a total of $4\times3\times2 = 24$ choices. So we have $2\times 24 = 48$ total choices that don't satisfy the requirement.

Thus, there are $336-48=\boxed{288}$ good choices.

The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.

We can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.

An integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.

The full number is $12+3+1=\boxed{16}$ integers.

The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product. Thus, our answer is  \[\binom{8}{3}\binom{5}{3}=56\cdot 10=\boxed{560}\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.

To find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.

Since the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \begin{align*}
190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\
&\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\
&= 180 + x.
\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.

To count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5}\right\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5}\right\rfloor$ means "divide 100 by 5 and round down.")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{25} \right\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.

Similarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{125} \right\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\left\lfloor \frac{300}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{300}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{300}{125} \right\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$.

All whole numbers can be written as $4k$, $4k+1$, $4k+2$, or $4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Suppose we look at the smaller of the two consecutive numbers. If it is of the form $4k$, it is a multiple of 4. If it is of the form $4k+3$, the other is $4k+4$, a multiple of 4. If on the other hand, it can be written as $4k+1$ or $4k+2$, neither number is a multiple of 4. So in two of the four equally likely cases, one of the numbers is a multiple of 4, for a probability of $2/4=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

In all, disregarding the gender rule, there are $$\binom{12}4\binom84=\frac{12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5}{4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}=34650$$ways of assigning the teams. We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.

There are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\cdot3\cdot15\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\cdot3\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys. Subtracting this from the total, we get $34650-4950=\boxed{29700}$ ways for the coach to assign the teams.

Extracting Answer from: 
If $a \geq 4$, then $a^3+b^2+c>a^3\geq 4^3>50$. But we want $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, so we must have $a=2$.  Now we substitute $a=2$ into $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, which gives $b^2+c\leq 42$. Since $b^2<42$, we know that $b$ must be one of 2, 4, or 6.

When $b=2,$ $c\leq 38$. There are 19 even positive integers less than or equal to 38, namely $2\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $\ldots$, $2\times 19$.

When $b=4,$ $c\leq 26$. There are 13 even positive integers less than or equal to 26.

When $b=6,$ $c\leq 6$. There are 3 even positive integers less than or equal to 6.

Thus the answer is $19+13+3=\boxed{35}$.

The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.

It is impossible for Chris to have both four aloe plants and five basil plants, so first we consider the case of four aloe plants. There are $\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to choose which of the plants are the aloe plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) ^2$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly four aloe plants is $15\cdot\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^4 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) ^2=\frac{20}{243}$. There are $\binom{6}{5}=6$ ways to choose five plants to be the basil plants. For each of these choices, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^5 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) ^1$ chance of that choice happening. Therefore, the total probability that Chris chooses exactly five basil plants is $6\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^5 \left( \frac{2}{3} \right) ^1=\frac{4}{243}$.

There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Alternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\frac{3}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for Ryan to arrange the lamps, and $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for him to choose which lamps are on, giving $20\cdot20=400$ total possible outcomes. There are two cases for the desired outcomes: either the left lamp is on, or it isn't. If the left lamp is on, there are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are on, and $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are red. This gives $10\cdot10=100$ possibilities. If the first lamp isn't on, there are $\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which lamps are on, and since both the leftmost lamp and the leftmost lit lamp must be red, there are $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which other lamp is red. This case gives 40 valid possibilities, for a total of 140 valid arrangements out of 400. Therefore, the probability is $\dfrac{140}{400}=\boxed{\dfrac{7}{20}}$.

We let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$.  The set of all possible pairs $(x,y)$ satisfy the inequalities $0<x<2$ and $0<y<2$; we can graph these points as a square on the $x-y$ plane with vertices $(0,0),(2,0),(2,2)$ and $(0,2)$.  This square has area $4.$

label("$x$", (2,0), E);

We want to find the area of the set of points which also satisfies $x^2+y^2\le 4$.  The set of ordered pairs that satisfy this inequality is a circle with radius $2$ centered at the origin.

The overlap between the circle and the square is the quarter-circle in the first quadrant with radius $2.$  This region has area $\frac{1}{4}(2)^2 \pi = \pi$.

Thus, the desired probability is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{4}}$.

There are $2^6 = 64$ possible outcomes, since each of the 6 coins has 2 possibilities.  If we do not get at least 2 heads, then we get either no heads or one heads.

From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.

From the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.

There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the tens place.

There are $8$ numbers with a $6$ in the tens place and a $6$ in the units place. (Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)

Adding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times. Therefore subtract $2$ from $28$ to get $\boxed{26}$ numbers containing the digit $6$ at least twice.

Extracting Answer from: 
The conditions under which $A+B=C$ are as follows.


(i) If $a+b< 1/2$, then $A=B=C=0$.


(ii) If $a\geq 1/2$ and $b<1/2$, then $B=0$ and $A=C=1$.


(iii) If $a<1/2$ and $b\geq 1/2$, then $A=0$ and $B=C=1$.


(iv) If $a+b\geq 3/2$, then $A=B=1$ and $C=2$.

These conditions correspond to the shaded regions of the graph shown. The combined area of those regions is 3/4, and the area of the entire square is 1, so the requested probability is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.
