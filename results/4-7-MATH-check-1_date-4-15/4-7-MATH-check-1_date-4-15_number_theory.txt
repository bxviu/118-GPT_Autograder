The positive multiples of 45 are  \[45,90,135,\ldots,990=1\cdot45,2\cdot45,3\cdot45,\ldots,22\cdot45.\] There are 22 multiples on this list. Every positive multiple of 45 less than 1000 is either a two-digit integer or a three-digit integer. Out of the $99-10+1=90$ two-digit integers, $45$ and $90$ are multiples of 45. Therefore, the probability that the selected multiple of 45 has two digits is $2/22=\boxed{\frac{1}{11}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We may begin by noting that $17\cdot 5=85\equiv 2\pmod{83}$. However, we are looking for $n$ such that $17\cdot n\equiv 1\pmod{83}$.

Note that $2\cdot 42=84\equiv 1\pmod{83}$. Therefore, \begin{align*}
17\cdot 5\cdot 42 &\equiv 2\cdot 42 \\
&\equiv 1\pmod{83},
\end{align*}which tells us that $17$ and $5\cdot 42$ are each other's inverses modulo $83$. We can evaluate $5\cdot 42=210$, but this is not in the range $0$ to $82$, so we take its residue $\pmod{83}$, which is $44$.

Therefore, $17^{-1}\equiv \boxed{44}\pmod{83}$.

We may check our answer: $17\cdot 44 = 748 = 9\cdot 83+1 \equiv 1\pmod{83}$, so our answer is correct.

Extracting Answer from: 
We want a remainder of $10$ when divided by both $11$ and $13$. The least common multiple of $11$ and $13$ is $143$. We add $10$ to the number such that the remainder would be $10$ when divided by $11$ and $13$ so we get $143+10=153$. However, that does not give a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7$, so we add more $143$s until we get a value that works. We get that $153+143+143=439$ gives a remainder of $5$ when divided by $7$.

Since we want the largest integer less than 2010, we keep adding the least common multiple of $7$, $11$, and $13$ until we go over. The least common multiple is $7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 =1001$. We add it to $439$ to get $1440$, adding it again would give a value greater than $2010$, so our answer is $\boxed{1440}$.

Jerry arrives 205 minutes after the buses start arriving (8:35 - 5:13 = 3 hours and 22 minutes = 202 minutes plus 3 minutes for the extra time before the 5:13 start time = 205 minutes). Since buses arrive every 20 minutes, and Jerry showed up one time after the start time, he will wait 15 minutes for the next bus (205 minutes รท 20 minutes = 10 with a remainder of 5. Since the remainder is less than half the bus frequency, 10 x 20 = 200, which means he was 5 minutes shy of catching the next bus.)

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the two integers be $a$ and $b$. Then, $\gcd(a,b) = 3$ and, without loss of generality, let $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 12a$. Multiplying the two equations yields that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] \cdot \gcd(a,b) = 36a$. Using the identity that $ab = \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] \cdot \gcd(a,b)$, it follows that $ab = 36a$, and so $b = 36$.

Since $\gcd(a,b) = 3$, we know $a$ is divisible by 3.  However, $a$ cannot be divisible by $3^2 = 9$, because if $a$ was divisible by 9, then $\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 9 as well, since 36 is divisible by 9.  This cannot occur since $\gcd(a,b) = 3$.  Similarly, $a$ cannot be divisible by 2, because if $a$ were divisible by 2, then $\gcd(a,b)$ would be divisible by 2 as well, since 36 is divisible by 2.

In summary, $a$ is a multiple of 3, but not 9, and $a$ is not divisible by 2.  The largest such number less than 100 is 93.  We can verify that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[93,36] = 1116 = 12 \cdot 93$, so the largest possible sum of $a + b$ is $36 + 93 = \boxed{129}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since we are looking for the largest number, we should start at 99 and work our way down.  No number in the 90s works, because the only numbers divisible by $9$ are $90$ and $99$. $90$ is invalid because no number is divisible by zero, and $99$ is invalid because the digits are the same.  The same reasoning applies to numbers with $8$, $7$, $6$, or $5$ in the tens place.  When we get to the 40s, however, there are three numbers that are divisible by $4$: $40$, $44$, and $48$. $48$ is also divisible by $8$, so the number we are looking for is $\boxed{48}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Jan steps on step number $s$ if $13\leq s \leq 130$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.  Jen steps on step number $s$ if $3\leq s \leq 139$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.  Therefore, we are counting the number of integers between $13$ and $130$ which leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$ and a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$. Let's check the remainders of Jan's first few steps when divided by 4. \[
13 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
16 \rightarrow 0
\] \[
19 \rightarrow 3
\] \[
22 \rightarrow 2
\] \[
25 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
\vdots
\] We see that the remainders of Jan's steps when divided by 4 cycle through the list $1,0,3,2$. Therefore, only every fourth step that Jan steps on will also be stepped on by Jen, so we are counting the number of elements in $\{19,31,43,\ldots,127\}$.  Writing this list in the form  \[\{19+0\cdot12,19+1\cdot12,19+2\cdot12,\ldots,19+9\cdot12\},\] we see that $\boxed{10}$ steps are stepped on by both Jen and Jan.

Suppose the book has $p$ pages. It follows that $p \equiv 11 \pmod{12}$. Also, since the second-to-last page has a trivia fact, then $p-1$ is divisible by $5$, so $p \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $11 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, then $p \equiv 11 \pmod{60}$. Now, $p$ is a double-digit number, so it must be either $11$ or $71$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If $\frac{1}{k}$ has a terminating decimal representation, then $k$ can be written in the form $2^a5^b$ for nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. To see this, note that by multiplying and dividing by a sufficiently large power of 10, we can write a terminating decimal as $r/10^s$ for some integers $r$ and $s$. Since the denominator's prime factorization contains only twos and fives, it may contain only twos and fives after simplification as well. Therefore, we start by listing the first several integers which are divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The first seven such values of $k$ are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 16.  Seeing that the list contains six elements preceding the large gap between 10 and 16, we guess that $2\times 6=12$ is the least positive integer up to which half of the positive integers give terminating decimals. Checking that the proportion is above 1/2 for $n=10, 8, 6, 4,$ and $2$, we find that $\boxed{12}$ is indeed the least integer satisfying the given condition.

Let $M$ be the least positive multiple of 30 that can be written with only the digits 0 and 2. First, $M$ is a multiple of 10, so its units digit must be 0. $M$ is also a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we must take at least  three 2's.

We begin by converting $682_{10}$ into base-6. We see that $6^3=216$ is the largest power of 6 that is less than 682, and that $3\cdot216=648$ is the largest multiple of 216 that is less than 682. This leaves us with a remainder of $682-648=34$, which we can express as $5\cdot6^1+4\cdot6^0$. So, $682_{10}=3\cdot6^3+0\cdot6^2+5\cdot{6^1}+4\cdot6^0=3054_6$. The first and last digits are 3 and 4, respectively, making the product of the two equal to $\boxed{12}$.

Notice that $(a+1)(a-5) = a^2 - 4a - 5$, so $a^2 - 4a + 1 = (a+1)(a-5) + 6$.

Also, we know that by the Euclidean algorithm, the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ divides $6$: \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(a+1, a-5) &= \text{gcd}\,(a+1-(a-5),a-5)\\
&= \text{gcd}\,(6,a-5).
\end{align*}As $10508$ is even but not divisible by $3$, for the sum of the digits of $10508$ is $1 + 5 + 8 = 14$, it follows that the greatest common divisor of $a+1$ and $a-5$ must be $2$.

From the identity $xy = \text{lcm}\,(x,y) \cdot \text{gcd}\,(x,y)$ (consider the exponents of the prime numbers in the prime factorization of $x$ and $y$), it follows that \begin{align*}
(a+1)(a-5) &= \text{lcm}\,(a+1,a-5) \cdot \text{gcd}\,(a+1, a-5) \\
&= 2 \cdot 10508.
\end{align*}Thus, the desired answer is $2 \cdot 10508 + 6 = \boxed{21022}.$

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when $N$ is divided by $4$ and $9$. The last two digits of $N$ must be one of $33, 37, 73,$ or $77$; each of these leave a remainder of $1$ after division by $4$. By the divisibility property of $4$, it follows that $N \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.

The sum of the digits of $N$ is equal to $13 \times 7 + 17 \times 3 = 142 = 15 \times 9 + 7$. This leaves a remainder of $7$ after division by $9$, so it follows that $N \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, it follows that $N \equiv 25 \pmod{36}$ satisfies the two congruences, and so $N$ leaves a remainder of $\boxed{25}$ upon division by $36$.

If there are $b$ gold coins in each of the original 7 bags, then $7b+53$ is divisible by 8. In other words, $7b + 53 \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$. Since $53 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$ and $7 \equiv -1 \pmod{8}$, we have that $-b \equiv -5 \pmod{8}$. Multiplying both sides by $-1$, we get that $b \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$. Now, we want $7b + 53 > 200$, so as a result, $b > \frac{200-53}{7} \implies b > 21$. Therefore, we want an integer greater than 21 which leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 8.

The smallest possible value of $\sqrt[3]{ax}$ is $\sqrt[3]{a \cdot 720} = \sqrt[3]{2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot a}$.

$\sqrt[3]{2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot a}$ is a perfect cube if and only if the power of each prime in its prime factorization is a multiple of $3$. So we must factor out as many $2$'s, $3$'s, and $5$'s as possible from $a$, without exceeding $720$.

Let $n$ be the number of soldiers. According to the problem statement, it follows that \begin{align*}
n &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \\
n &\equiv 2 \pmod{3} \\
n &\equiv 5 \pmod{11}
\end{align*}By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is an unique residue that $n$ can leave, modulo $33$; since $5 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$, it follows that $n \equiv 5 \pmod{33}$. Also, we know that $n$ is divisible by $4$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again, it follows that $n \equiv 104 \pmod{132}$. Writing out the first few positive values of $n$, we obtain that $n = 104, 236, 368$, and so forth. The closest value of $n$ is $\boxed{236}$.

We could find the answer by trial and error -- testing each candidate $t$ to see if $t\cdot (t+2)\equiv 1\pmod{23}$. However, here is another way:

We can easily see that $4\cdot 6=24\equiv 1\pmod{23}$, so $4$ fulfills the main requirement that its inverse is $2$ more than it. Unfortunately, $4$ isn't odd. But we also have \begin{align*}
(-4)\cdot (-6) &= 4\cdot 6 \\
&\equiv 1\pmod{23},
\end{align*} so $-4$ and $-6$ are each other's inverses $\pmod{23}$. Since $-4\equiv 19\pmod{23}$ and $-6\equiv 17\pmod{23}$, the answer $t=\boxed{17}$ satisfies the requirements of the problem.

(We can even check that $17\cdot 19 = 323 = 14\cdot 23 + 1$.)

Recall that a simplified fraction has a terminating decimal representation if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 or 5.

The prime factorization for $30$ is $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$. Therefore, the decimal representation for $n/30$ terminates if and only if $n$ has a factor of 3 to cancel the 3 in the denominator. There are $9$ multiples of 3 less than 30 (namely $3(1), 3(2) 3(3), \ldots, 3(9)$) so there are $29-9=\boxed{20}$ integers $n$ between 1 and 29 for which $n/30$ is a repeating decimal.

An integer is divisible by $18$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$ and the last digit is even (meaning it is divisible by both 9 and 2).  The sum of the digits of 142857 is 27, so this number is a multiple of 9.  The number is odd, so it is not a multiple of 18.  Instead the number is 9 more than a multiple of 18.  Therefore  $$\boxed{9}\equiv 142857\pmod {18}.$$

Places to the right of the decimal point represent negative powers of the base, so we notice that the series in base 10 is $2^{-1}-2^{-2}+2^{-3}\ldots=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}\ldots$. We recognize this as a geometric series with a common ratio of $-\frac{1}{2}$ and apply the formula $\frac{a}{1-r}$ for the sum of a geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$. We get $$\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1-\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{2}}=\frac{1}{3}.$$So, the sum of the geometric series is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

For the number to be as small as possible, the leftmost digit should be as small as possible. Therefore, the ten thousandth digit should be $1$. The other four digits would have to add up to $20-1=19$. The leftmost digit is now the thousandth digit, which should be the smallest number possible, $1$. We can also put a $1$ in the hundredths place.  The last two digits then have to add up to $20-1-1-1=17$.  The only single-digit numbers that add to $17$ are $8$ and $9$.  Since $8$ is smaller, that goes in the tens place, and the $9$ goes in the ones place.  Therefore, the smallest five-digit number possible is $\boxed{11189}$.

There are 2009 positive integers less than 2010, of which 1005 are odd. If $\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, then $n$ can only be divisible by 2 and 5. However, since we have the added restriction that $n$ is odd, $n$ must be a power of 5. There are five powers of 5 less than 2010. \begin{align*}
5^0 &= 1 \\
5^1 &= 5 \\
5^2 &= 25 \\
5^3 &= 125 \\
5^4 &= 625
\end{align*} Note that $5^5 = 3125$. Since there are five odd integers that satisfy our desired condition, the desired probability is $\frac{5}{1005} = \frac{1}{201}$. This is in simplest terms, so our answer is $1+201 = \boxed{202}$.

Then,

$1000S = 283.283283283\dots$

Thus,

$999S = 283$

$S = \frac{283}{999}$

Recall that $a\equiv 3 \pmod{7}$ if and only if $a-3$ is divisible by 7. Subtracting 3 from every element in the list gives  $$
82 \qquad 49,\!476 \qquad -70 \qquad 12,\!000,\!000 \qquad -6
$$By dividing, we can see that 82 and $-6$ are not divisible by 7, whereas $-70$ and $49,\!476$ are divisible by 7. To see that $12,\!000,\!000$ is not divisible by 7, note that its prime factorization is $(12)(10^6)=(2^2\cdot 3)(2\cdot 5)^6 = 2^8\cdot 3\cdot 5^6$. So, after striking off the numbers which are congruent to 3 (mod 7), the original list becomes $$

To determine the residue of $a\pmod{10}$, we can subtract $a+b$ from $2a+b$: \begin{align*}
a &= (2a+b) - (a+b) \\
&\equiv 1 - 2 \\
&\equiv -1 \\
&\equiv 9 \pmod{10}.
\end{align*}Then we know that $9+b\equiv 2\pmod{10}$, so we can solve for $b$: \begin{align*}
b &\equiv 2-9 \\
&\equiv -7 \\
&\equiv 3 \pmod{10}.

Here is the solution to the problem.

$2a+b\equiv 1\pmod{10}$ implies $2a+b=10m+1$ for some integer $m$.

$a+b\equiv 2\pmod{10}$ implies that $a$ and $b$ have the same parity. Since $a$ is just a little bit larger than $b$, they are both odd or both even; in any case, their difference is even. We write $a-b=2d$.

So $2b+d=10n+2$ and $2a+d=10n+3$ for some integers $d$ and $n$. Subtracting, we have $2(a-b)=2a-2b=10n+1$, which means $a-b=5n+\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore the last digit of $a-b$ must be $5$. $\boxed{5}$ is the answer.

Extracting Answer from: 
Consider a "normal" year with 365 days.  Since 365 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7, for every normal year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  (For example, if the first day of one normal year is on a Tuesday, then the first day of the next year will be on a Wednesday.)

However, leap years have 366 days.  Since 366 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 7, a leap year shifts the first day of the year by two days.

There are 40 years between 1960 and 2000, and $40/4 = 10$ of these years were leap years.  The remaining $40 - 10 = 30$ years were normal years.  Therefore, the first day shifted forward by $30 + 2 \cdot 10 = 50$ days day-wise.

Since 50 leaves a remainder of 1 by 7, shifting forward 50 days day-wise is equivalent to shifting forward 1 day day-wise.  Since January 1, 2000 was a Saturday, we conclude that January 1, 1960 was a $\boxed{\text{Friday}}$.

An integer $n$ in the form $p^e$, for some prime $p$ and positive integer $e$, has $(e+1)$ positive factors. To maximize $e$, let $p=2$, the smallest prime. Since $n$ is less than 20, $e$ is at most 4, which means $n$ can have 5 factors. If $n$ is in the form $p_1^{e_1}\cdot p_2^{e_2}$, then let $p_1=2$ and $p_2=3$ to find the maximum possible $e_1$ and $e_2$. Both cannot be 2 (else $n=36$), so $e_1, e_2=1, 2$ give the most factors: $(2+1)(1+1)=\boxed{6}$ factors. Finally, $n$ cannot be divisible by any other prime since $2\cdot3\cdot5=30>20$. Thus, the greatest number of distinct positive integer factors that a positive integer less than 20 can have is 6 factors. Of course, we could have solved this problem by finding the number of factors of each positive integer less than 20, but in general our approach is more efficient.

Testing for divisibility by 9 does not work, because the sum of the digits is 18, so the digit could be either 0 or 9. Test for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of the digits of $12!$ is $4-7+a-1+6 = 2+a$, which must be divisible by 11. Therefore, since $2+9=11$, we have $\boxed{a=9}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$12! = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$. Since $10$ and $5$ each appears in the factorial exactly once, we can write:

\begin{align*}
12! &= 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \\
&= 12 \times 11 \times (10 \times 9) \times 8 \times 7 \times (6 \times 5) \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \\
&= 12 \times 11 \times 2 \times 4 \times 9 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 3 \times 2 \\
&= 2^8 \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 7^2 \times 11.
\end{align*}

Since $a$ is the units digit of $12!$, we need only find the units digit of $2^8 \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 7^2 \times 11$, which is the same as the units digit of $2^8 \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \times 1 \times 1$. Following the method described in solution 1 of this [AoPS post] (https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3h461734) we get:

$2^8 \equiv 6 \pmod{10}$

$3^5 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$

$5^2 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$

Thus, $2^8 \times 3^5 \times 5^2 \equiv 6 \times 7 \times 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}$ and $a = \boxed{0}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to multiply the units digit: $5_6 \times 4_6 = 20_{10} = 32_6$. Hence, we write down a $2$ and carry-over the $3$. Evaluating the next digit, we need to multiply $1_6 \times 4_6 + 3_6 = 7_{10} = 11_{6}$. Thus, the next digit is a $1$ and $1$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by $3_6 \times 4_6 + 1_6 = 13_{10} = 21_6$. Writing this out:  $$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}

\end{align*}This is not the answer since we want to find $n$ with $1000\leq n<1099$.  Therefore we should add copies of 99 until we get into this range.  Since 1000 is slightly more than $990=99\cdot10$, we begin by adding 990. \[86\equiv 86+990\equiv1076\pmod{99}.\]That is in our range, so $n=\boxed{1076}$.

If we are working in base $b$, then we have $(4b+4)(5b+5) - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 = 0$. \begin{align*}
0 &= (4b+4)(5b+5) - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\
&= 20(b+1)^2 - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\
&= 20b^2 + 40b + 20 - 3b^3 - 5b^2 - 6 \\
&= -3b^3 + 15b^2 + 40b + 14
\end{align*}Therefore, we must solve the cubic $3b^3 - 15b^2 - 40b - 14 = 0$. By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible positive integer solutions to this equation are 1, 2, 7, and 14. 1 and 2 are invalid bases since the digit 6 is used, so we first try $b=7$. It turns out that $b=7$ is a solution to this cubic. If we divide by $b-7$, we get the quadratic $3b^2 + 6b + 2$, which has no integral solutions. Therefore, in base $\boxed{7}$, we have $44 \times 55 = 3506$.

\end{align*}This is congruent modulo $20$ to $ab+10(a+b)$.

Now we observe that $ab$ is $17$ more than a multiple of $20$, so $ab$ is odd, which means $a$ and $b$ must each be odd. Therefore, $a+b$ is even, so $10(a+b)$ is a multiple of $20$. It follows that $$ab+10(a+b) \equiv ab \equiv \boxed{17}\pmod{20}.$$

Any sum formed by a combination of the numbers $2,4$ and $8$ must be divisible by $2$. The smallest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \cdot 2 = 6$, and the largest possible value of such a sum is equal to $3 \cdot 8 = 24$. After testing, we find that \begin{align*}6 = 2+2+2,\ 8 = 4+2+2,\ 10 = 4+4+2, \\ 12 = 4+4+4,\ 14 = 8+4+2,\ 16 = 8+4+4, \\ 18 = 8+8+2,\ 20 = 8+8+4,\ 24 = 8+8+8.\end{align*} However, we cannot find a combination that will add to be $22$: if two of the numbers are not $8$, then the maximum possible sum is $4 + 4 + 8 = 16$. Thus, two of the numbers picked must be $8$, but then the third ball must have the number $6$, which is not possible.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the residues of $N$ modulo $5$, $6$, and $7$. Since the units digit of $N$ in base $6$ is equal to $0$, it follows that $N$ is divisible by $6$. Also, we note that $N$ is congruent modulo $b-1$ to the sum of its base $b$ digits. Indeed, if $N$ can be represented as $(\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\cdots a_0})_b$, then \begin{align*}N &\equiv a_k \cdot b^k + a_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 \cdot b + a_0 \\ &\equiv a_k \cdot ((b-1) + 1)^k + \cdots + a_1 \cdot ((b-1) + 1) + a_0 \\
& \equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \pmod{b-1}.
\end{align*}It follows that $N \equiv 5+3+1+3+4+0 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ and that $N \equiv 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.$ By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, we determine that $N \equiv 31 \pmod{35}$, so that (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again) $N \equiv \boxed{66} \pmod{210}$.

By the Euclidean algorithm, we have  \begin{align*}

\end{align*}since the integer $3a^2+19a+30$ is divisible by $a+3$ for all integers $a$, as the factorization $3a^2+19a+30=(3a+10)(a+3)$ shows. Thus $f(a)-a$ is equal to 3 for all positive integers $a$, so its maximum value is $\boxed{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We start by changing the expressions to base 10 in terms of $a$ and $b$. We also know that the two expressions should be equal since they represent the same number. \begin{align*}
32_a&=23_b\quad\Rightarrow\\
3\cdot a+2\cdot 1&=2\cdot b +3\cdot1\quad\Rightarrow\\
3a+2&=2b+3\quad\Rightarrow\\
3a&=2b+1.
\end{align*}For the smallest sum $a+b$, we would want the smallest bases $a$ and $b$. $a$ and $b$ must be greater than 3, so we'll let $a=4$ and that means $12=2b+1$ and $b$ is not an integer. Next we try $a=5$ and that means $15=2b+1$ and $b=7$. That means our sum is $5+7=\boxed{12}$. We can check that both expressions work: $32_5=3\cdot5+2=17$ and $23_7=2\cdot7+3=17$.
Also, it makes sense that $a=5$ works while $a=4$ does not since $3a$ must be odd for $b$ to be an integer ($3a-1=2b$ means $3a$ must be even after subtracting 1), and for $3a$ to be odd, $a$ must also be odd.

Alternatively, we can just try different bases. The smallest possible value for $a$ and $b$ is 4. If we let $b=4$, we'd need a smaller base for $a$ (since we have $3\cdot a\approx2\cdot b$), which isn't possible. When we let $a=4$, we get $32_4=14$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=14$. That means $2b+3=14$ and $b$ is not an integer. When we let $a=5$, we get $32_5=17$ and try to find a $b$ such that $23_b=17$. If $2b+3=17$, then $b=7$ and we still get $a+b=\boxed{12}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that by pairing up divisors of $n$, we can show that the product of the positive integer factors of $n$ is $n^\frac{x}{2}$. We divide this formula by $n$ to get the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$, and we obtain $\frac{n^\frac{x}{2}}{n} = n^{\frac{x}{2}-1} = n^\frac{x-2}{2}$. Therefore, $a = 1$, $b = -2$, and $c = 2$, so $a+b+c = \boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$(ax+b)/c$ represents the average of the exponents of the prime factorization of all the divisors of $n$. Since the product of the divisors of $n$ is $\sqrt{n}$ raised to a power that is an integer (the combined exponents of the prime factorization of $n$), the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$ is $\sqrt{n}$ raised to the power of the average of these exponents (which is the average of the number of divisors of $n$). Hence, $n^{(ax+b)/c}=(\sqrt{n})^{ax+b}/\sqrt{n^c}$ is the product of the proper positive integer factors of $n$. Because $c$ is a positive integer and $ax+b$ is divisible by $c$, $a+b+c$ is a factor of $a^c+b^c+c^c$. Thus, since $1+1+1=3$ is coprime to $a+b+c$, $a+b+c=3$.

Since $9 \cdot 2 = 18 = 17 + 1$, it follows that $9$ is the modular inverse of $2$, modulo $17$. Thus, $2^n \equiv 2^9 \pmod{17}$. After computing some powers of $2$, we notice that $2^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17}$, so $2^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{17}$, and $2^9 \equiv 2 \pmod{17}$. Thus, $(2^9)^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{17}$, and $(2^9)^2 - 2 \equiv \boxed{2} \pmod{17}$.

Notice that this problem implies that $\left(a^{2^{-1}}\right)^2 \not\equiv a \pmod{p}$ in general, so that certain properties of modular inverses do not extend to exponentiation (for that, one needs to turn to Fermat's Little Theorem or other related theorems).

A three-digit palindrome must be of the form $1\Box1, 2\Box2, \cdots 9\Box9$, where $\Box$ is any digit from 0 to 9. So there are $9\cdot10=90$ three-digit palindromes. Now we look at which ones are multiples of 3. Recall that a positive integer is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. If we look at $1\Box1$, we want $1+1+\Box$ to be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 1, 4, or 7. With $2\Box2$, $2+2+\Box$ should be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 2, 5, or 8. With $3\Box3$, $\Box$ could be 0, 3, 6, or 9. The possible $\Box$ values then repeat, $4\Box4$ giving 1, 4, or 7, $5\Box5$ giving 2, 5, or 8, etc. So the number of multiples of 3 is $3\times (3+3+4)=30$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2\cdot11$. So for $\frac{n}{99}$ to be in lowest terms, $n$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 11. The possible values of $n$ are from 1 to 98, inclusive, so there are 98 possible values for $n$. We can find the number of multiples of 3 and multiples of 11 and subtract from 98 to get the number of values that aren't divisible by 3 or 11. For multiples of 3, we go from 3 to 96, or $3\cdot1$ to $3\cdot32$, so there are 32 multiples of 3 from 1 to 98, inclusive. For multiples of 11, we go from 11 to 88, so there are 8 multiples of 11 from 1 to 98, inclusive. We have to make sure we don't double-count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 11: 33 and 66. So there are $32+8-2=38$ values of $n$ that are divisible by 3 or 11. That means there are $98-38=\boxed{60}$ values of $n$ for which $\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms.

The positive integers with exactly four positive factors can be written in the form $pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers, or $p^3$, where $p$ is a prime number.

Using this, we can see that the smallest five positive integers with exactly four positive factors are $2\cdot 3 = 6$, $2^3 = 8$, $2\cdot 5 = 10$, $2\cdot 7 = 14$, and $3\cdot 5 = 15$. Summing these numbers, we get $6 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 15 = \boxed{53}$.

If $m$ is any integer, then $\gcd(m,100)$ is one of the positive divisors of $100$: $$1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.$$We note that the numbers on this list with more than one digit are all multiples of $10$, with the exception of $25$. Thus, $m$ has a single-digit $\gcd$ with $100$ if and only if $m$ is not a multiple of either $10$ or $25$. Thus, we just need to count integers $m$ between $0$ and $100$ which are not multiples of $10$ or of $25$.

There are $99$ integers $m$ such that $0<m<100$. These include nine multiples of $10$ ($10,20,30,\ldots,80,90$) and two more multiples of $25$ ($25$ and $75$; we don't count $50$ because we already counted it). So, that leaves $99-9-2=\boxed{88}$ integers whose greatest common divisor with $100$ has a single digit.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $k = n+2005$. Since $1 \le n \le 9999$, we have $2006 \le k \le 12004$. We know that $k$ has exactly 21 positive factors. The number of positive factors of a positive integer with prime factorization $p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_r^{e_r}$ is $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)\cdots(e_r+1)$. Since $21 = 7 \cdot 3$ and 7 and 3 are prime, the prime factorization of $k$ is either of the form $p^{20}$ or $p^6 q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct prime numbers. Since $p^{20} \geq 2^{20} > 12004$ for any prime $p$, we can't have the first form. So $k = p^6 q^2$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q$.

If $p=2$, then $k=64q^2$. So $2006 \le 64q^2 \le 12004 \Rightarrow 31.34375 \le q^2 \le 187.5625$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $6 \le q \le 13$. Since $q$ is prime, $q$ is 7, 11, or 13. So if $p=2$, the possible values of $k$ are $2^6 7^2 = 3136$, $2^6 11^2 = 7744$, and $2^6 13^2 = 10816$.

If $p=3$, then $k = 729q^2$. So $2006 \le 729q^2 \le 12004 \Rightarrow 2.75\ldots \le q^2 \le 16.46\ldots$. For $q$ an integer, this holds when $2 \le q \le 4$. Since $q$ is a prime distinct from $p=3$, we have $q=2$. So if $p=3$, $k = 3^6 2^2 = 2916$.

If $p \ge 5$, then $k \ge 15625q^2 > 12004$, a contradiction. So we have found all possible values of $k$. The sum of the possible values of $n = k - 2005$ is thus \begin{align*}
&(3136-2005) \\
+ &(7744-2005)\\
+ &(10816-2005)\\
+ &(2916-2005)\\

Extracting Answer from: 
A) By the definition of factor, there must be some integer $n$ such that $60=b \cdot n.$ In addition, there must be some integer $m$ such that $b= a \cdot m.$ Substituting the second equation into the first yields $60=(a \cdot m) \cdot n=a \cdot (mn).$ Because $m$ and $n$ are integers, so is $mn.$ Thus, $a$ is a factor of $60.$ This statement is true.

B) By the definition of divisor, there must exist some integer $n$ such that $60=b \cdot n.$ However, because $n$ is an integer, this also means that $60$ is a multiple of $b.$ This statement is true.

C) $b$ and $c$ are both factors of 60, and $b<c.$ In many cases, this statement is true. However, there are counterexamples. For example, $c=30$ and $b=20.$ Both numbers are divisors of $60,$ but $20$ is not a factor of $30$ because there is no integer $n$ such that $30=20 \cdot n.$ This statement is false.

D) If $a$ were to be $20,$ then the given inequality would be $20<b<c<60$ where $b$ and $c$ are factors of $60.$ Listing out the factors of $60,$ we see $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6,$ $10,$ $12,$ $15,$ $20,$ $30,$ $60.$ However, there is only one factor of $60$ that is between $20$ and $60,$ so it is impossible to choose a $b$ and $c$ that satisfy the conditions. Thus, this statement is true.

E) If $b$ is negative, then by the given inequality, so is $a$ because $a<b.$ We also know that $a$ is a divisor of $b.$ Thus, there exists an integer $n$ such that $b=a \cdot n.$ Dividing both sides by $a$ yields $n=\frac{b}{a}.$ Because both $a$ and $b$ are negative, $n$ must be positive. Recall that $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{-x}{-y}.$ Thus, the fraction $\frac{b}{a}$ where $a<b$ and both are negative is the same as the fraction $\frac{-b}{-a}$ where $-a>-b.$ However, because both the numerator and denominator are positive, and the denominator is greater than the numerator, it is impossible for this fraction to be an integer. But $n$ must be an integer, so this statement is false.

Thus, the false statements are $\boxed{\text{C,E}}.$

$\bullet$ If $a$ is a factor of $b,$ then $b$ must be a multiple of $a$.

$\bullet$ Since $b<c$ and $b|60, c|60,$ $b$ must be a divisor of $60$ and a factor of $c.$

$\bullet$ Let $a=20,$ then $b$ would have to be $30.$ But then $c$ could not be a divisor of $60.$

$\bullet$ $60$ cannot be negative, so $b$ must be positive.

Let $\alpha$ be the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $m$. That is, $m=2^\alpha\cdot t$, where $t$ is some odd integer.

Note that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[8m,10^{10}] = \mathop{\text{lcm}}[2^3m,2^{10}5^{10}]$, so the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[8m,10^{10}]$ is equal to $\max\{3+\alpha,10\}$.

Similarly, the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $4\cdot\mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,10^{10}]$ is $2+\max\{\alpha,10\}$. Thus we have $$\max\{3+\alpha,10\} = 2+\max\{\alpha,10\},$$which is possible only if $\alpha=9$. So, $m$ is divisible by $2^9=512$. The only 3-digit multiple of $2^9$ is $512$ itself, so $m=\boxed{512}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
For an integer $abcde$ to be divisible by $11$ then $a-b+c-d+e$ is divisible by $11.$

We start with the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 0.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d.$ Since we have a palindrome, we must have $a = e$ and $b = d,$ meaning that $2a+c=2b.$ We must have that $a$ and $e$ must be at least $1,$ so then we can let $b$ and $d$ also be 1 and $c$ be zero. So the smallest such five-digit palindrome is $11011.$

Then, we investigate the case where $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = 11.$ Then, $a+c+e=b+d+11,$ and $a = e$ and $b = d,$ so  $2a + c = 11 + 2b.$ We see that we can let $a$ be 1 and $c$ be 9, then $b = 0,$ and we have the palindrome $10901.$

Finally, $(a+c+e)-(b+d) = -11.$ Then, $2a + c = 2b - 11.$ We check if $a = 1$ has any solutions. We get $2 + c = 2b - 11,$ so $c - 2b = -9.$ Then, we can see that there are no solutions for $b = 0$, since then we would have $c = -9.$ Since we already found $10901,$ we do not need to check for any $b$ greater than $0$, so we see that our solution is $\boxed{10901}.$

Notice that for each integer $n$ satisfying $1 \le n \le 19, n \neq 10$, then using the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + (20 - n)^3 = (n + 20 - n)(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$ $ = 20(n^2 + (20-n)n + (20-n)^2)$. Thus, we can pair each integer with the difference between $20$ and that integer, and the sum of their cubes is divisible by $20$. Hence, the units digit of the sum of the first $19$ cubes, excluding $10$, is equal to $0$. Also, the units digits of $10^3$ and $20^3$ are clearly $0$, so we just need to find the units digit of the cube of $21$, which is $\boxed{1}$.

4$ = 4!^{4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}}$. Therefore, in order to find the units digit of the quantity, we only need to find the units digit of $4!$, $4!^{4!}$, $4!^{4!^{4!}}$, $4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}$, etc. 

We start by finding the units digit of $4!$. We know $4! = 24$, hence the units digit is 4.

Next, to find the units digit of $4!^{4!}$, we find the units digit of $4!$ and then raise it to the power of the units digit of $4!$. We get the following:

- Units digit of $4!$: 4
- Units digit of $4!^{4!}$: $4^4 = 256$, hence the units digit is 6.

Following the same process for $4!^{4!^{4!}}$ and $4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}$, we get:

- Units digit of $4!^{4!^{4!}}$: $4^6 = 4096$, hence the units digit is 6.
- Units digit of $4!^{4!^{4!^{4!}}}$: $4^6$ ends in a 6, hence the units digit is 6.

We first compute the prime factorization of 2010, which is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$. Therefore, if we want $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ to be a repeating decimal, then $n^2$ cannot be divisible by 3 and 67 at the same time. If this were the case, then we could convert our fraction to $\frac{k}{10}$, where $201k = n^2$, and $\frac{k}{10}$ is clearly a terminating decimal. Conversely, no simplified terminating decimal has a factor of 3 or 67 in the denominator. It follows that if $n$ is not divisible by $3\cdot 67$, then $n$ is a repeating decimal. Therefore, we need to compute the number of values of $n$ that yield squares which are not divisible by 3 and 67. However, $n^2$ is divisible by 3 and 67 if and only if $n$ must be divisible by 3 and 67. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $3 \cdot 67=201$. There are $10$ multiplies of $201$ which are less than or equal to $2010$, so there are $2010 - 10 = \boxed{2000}$ values of $n$ that yield a fraction $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ which is a repeating decimal.

The base-$b$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$ if and only if $2013$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $b$: that is, if $2010$ is a multiple of $b.$ Since $2010 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 67^1,$ it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ positive divisors. However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$). Therefore, the answer is $16 - 3 = \boxed{13}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Suppose $n$ is a solution to the congruence $$(12{,}500{,}000)\cdot n\equiv 111\pmod{999{,}999{,}999}.$$Then, by multiplying both sides by $80$, we see that $n$ satisfies $$(1{,}000{,}000{,}000)\cdot n\equiv 8{,}880 \pmod{999{,}999{,}999}.$$The left side of this congruence is equivalent to $1\cdot n = n\pmod{999{,}999{,}999}$, so we have $n\equiv 8{,}880\pmod{999{,}999{,}999}$.

Since $80$ is relatively prime to $999{,}999{,}999$, it has an inverse $\pmod{999{,}999{,}999}$. (In fact, we know this inverse: it's $12{,}500{,}000$.) Thus we can reverse the steps above by multiplying both sides by $80^{-1}$. So, any integer $n$ satisfying $n\equiv 8{,}880\pmod{999{,}999{,}999}$ is a solution to the original congruence.

The smallest positive integer in this solution set is $n=\boxed{8{,}880}$.

We could do this by the divisibility rules, but that would be quite tedious. It's easier to note that a number divisible by $3, 4,$ and $5$ must be divisible by their product, $3 \times 4 \times 5 = 60$. This is because a number which is divisible by several integers must be divisible by their least common multiple -- however, since $3, 4,$ and $5$ are relatively prime, the least common multiple is just the product of all three. Clearly, there is only one number between $1$ and $100$ divisible by $60;$ that is, $60$ itself. Thus there is only $\boxed{1}$ such number.

We begin by realizing that the largest power of $7$ which is less than $441$ is $7^3 = 343$, and the greatest multiple of $343$ which is less than $441$ is $1 \cdot 343 = 343$. We then have $441 = 1 \cdot 343 + 98$. Now, we consider the remainder $98$. The largest power of $7$ that is less than $98$ is $7^2 = 49$ and $98 = 2 \cdot 49$. There is no remainder so we have $$441 = 1 \cdot 7^3 + 2 \cdot 7^2 + 0 \cdot 7^1 + 0 \cdot 7^0.$$Therefore, our base $7$ representation of $441_{10}$ is $\boxed{1200_7}$.

Since $\overline{ab} | \overline{abcd} = 100 \cdot \overline{ab} + \overline{cd}$, then $\overline{ab}$ also divides into $\overline{abcd} - 100 \cdot \overline{ab} = \overline{cd}$. Similarly, since $\overline{cd} | \overline{abcd} = 100 \cdot \overline{ab} + \overline{cd}$, then $\overline{cd}$ must divide into $\overline{abcd} - \overline{cd} = 100 \cdot \overline{ab}$. To minimize $\overline{abcd}$, then we would like to try $a = b = 1$. It follows that $\overline{cd}$ is divisible by $11$, and also divides into $100 \cdot \overline{ab} = 1100$. Thus, $\overline{cd} = 11,22,44,55$, but we can eliminate the first due to the distinctness condition. Trying each of the others, we see that $1122 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 11 \cdot 17$ is not divisible by $12$; $1144 = 2^3 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ is not divisible by $14$; and $\boxed{1155} = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$ is indeed divisible by $15$.

The smallest possible value of ab, bc, and cd, would be `10`. Thus, we can try all integers, greater than or equal to 1023,  such that when divided by `10` yields a remainder of `0`. We will divide this number into `ab`, `bc`, and `cd`. If these divisions produce no remainder, we have a solution. If we reach 10000 and have not yet found a solution, then we know that no solution exists.

The smallest possible value of `abcd` with this condition is `1023`. Here is the list of four-digit numbers we need to try with a step of `10`: `1023`, `1030`, `1040`, $\cdots$, `9990`.

Let the desired number be $a$. Then \begin{align*}
a \equiv 0 & \pmod {17}\\
a \equiv -1\equiv 7 & \pmod 8
\end{align*} The first congruence implies that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=17n$. Substituting this into the second congruence yields $$17n\equiv 7\pmod 8,$$ $$\implies n\equiv 7\pmod 8.$$ So $n$ has a lower bound of $7$. Then $$n\ge 7,$$ $$\implies a=17n\ge 119.$$ $119$ satisfies both congruences, so subtracting it from both sides of both congruences gives \begin{align*}
a-119\equiv -119\equiv 0 &\pmod {17}\nonumber\\
a-119\equiv -112\equiv 0 &\pmod 8\nonumber
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(17,8)=1$, we get $a-119\equiv 0\pmod{17\cdot 8}.$ That is, $a\equiv 119\pmod {136}.$

Note that every number that satisfies this congruence satisfies the original two congruences. The largest number of the form $119+136m$ for some non-negative integer $m$, and less than $1000$, is $119+136\cdot 6=\boxed{935}.$

Note $1980 = 2^23^25^111^1$, $384=2^7 3^1$, $1694 = 2^1 7^1 11^2$, and $343=7^3$. Their GCD is $1$, so the integer $m$ is not a perfect power (i.e., we can't take $n=1$). We need $n=2^a3^b5^c7^d$ (any other prime factors of $n$ would be superfluous) such that $(1980+a,384+b,1694+c,343+d)$ has GCD greater than $1$ (i.e., we must use $n$ to "modify" the exponents of the primes in the prime factorization to get an integer $mn$ which actually is a perfect power).

First we search for a prime which divides at least three of the exponents $1980$, $384$, $1694$, and $343$, which would mean we only have to modify one of them (hence have $n$ be a prime power). This, however, is only true of the prime $2$, and the exponent not divisible by $2$ is $343$, which is the exponent of 7 in $m$. Therefore, to modify only one of the exponents, we would need $(a,b,c,d)=(0,0,0,1)$, giving $n=7$. But there is one number less than $7$ which has more than one prime divisor, and that is $6$. Furthermore, $7 \mid 1694, 343$, and $1980 \equiv 384 \equiv -1 \mod{7}$, so if we set $a=b=1$ and $c=d=0$, we find that $(1980+a,384+b,1694+c,343+d)$ has $7$ as a divisor.

This gives $n=6$, which is therefore the smallest value such that $mn$ is a perfect power. In this case, $mn$ is a perfect $7$th power, so $k=7$. Thus $n+k=6+7=\boxed{13}$.

The sum of an arithmetic series is $(\text{first term}+\text{last term})(\text{number of terms})/2$, so the sum of the possible values of $n$ is $(545+993)(8)/2=\boxed{6152}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The sum of all possible values of $n$ in base 10 is equal to the sum of all possible values for $d$ in the range $0\leq d\leq 7$, since $d$ can take on any base-8 digit. In base 8, the number $1d41_8$ can be expressed as $160+8d+4+1$, or $165+8d$. Thus, the possible values of $n$ are $165+0\cdot8$, $165+1\cdot8$, $165+2\cdot8$, $\ldots$, $165+7\cdot8$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the values of $n$ is equal to $(165+0+165+7\cdot8)/2\cdot8=1056$. So the answer is $\boxed{1056}$.

First of all, we know that $a > c,$ we do not have to worry about $2a + b - c$ being negative. In any case, we have: \begin{align*}
a &\equiv 4\pmod{19}, \\
b &\equiv 2\pmod{19}, \\
c &\equiv 18\pmod{19}.
\end{align*}Adding as needed, we have $2a + b - c = a + a + b - c \equiv 4 + 4 + 2 - 18 \equiv -8 \equiv 11 \pmod{19}.$ Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{11}.$

For every divisor $d$ of $12$, the number $12/d$ is also a divisor of $12$. Their product is $d \cdot (12/d) = 12$. It follows that every divisor can be paired with another divisor of $12$ such that their product is $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$. There are $(2+1)(1+1) = 6$ divisors of $12$, namely $1,2,3,4,6,12$. Thus, the product of the divisors is given by $12^{6/2} = 12^3.$ Since we need to exclude $12$ itself, the answer is $\frac{12^3}{12} = \boxed{144}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $16$ is even and only has a prime factor of $2$, all of the odd numbers are relatively prime with $16$ and their modular inverses exist. Furthermore, the inverses must be distinct: suppose that $a^{-1} \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{16}$. Then, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $ab$ to obtain that $b \equiv ab \cdot a^{-1} \equiv ab \cdot b^{-1} \equiv a \pmod{16}$.

Also, the modular inverse of an odd integer $\mod{16}$ must also be odd: if the modular inverse of $m$ was of the form $2n$, then $2mn = 16k + 1$, but the left-hand side is even and the right-hand side is odd.

Thus, the set of the inverses of the first $8$ positive odd integers is simply a permutation of the first $8$ positive odd integers. Then, \begin{align*}&1^{-1} + 3^{-1} + \cdots + 15^{-1} \\
&\equiv 1 + 3 + \cdots + 15 \\ &\equiv 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + (-7) + (-5) + (-3) + (-1) \\ &\equiv \boxed{0} \pmod{16}.\end{align*}

$10101$ is clearly not divisible by $2$ or $5$. The sum of $10101$'s digits is $3$, so it is divisible by $3$, but not by $9$. $10101=3\cdot3367$. $3367/7=481$ and $481/7=68\frac{5}{7}$ so $10101=3\cdot7\cdot481$ and $481$ is not divisible by any prime number less than $11$. Applying the divisibility test for 11, we have $4-8+1=-3$, which is not divisible by 11, so $481$ is not divisible by $11$ either. $481/13=37$ and $37$ is prime, so the prime factorization of $10101$ is $10101=3\cdot7\cdot13\cdot37$.

To see that no other digits work, note that only the bases 4, 5, and 6 use three digits to represent the number 36.

Since no two of the four integers are congruent modulo 6, they must represent four of the possible residues $0,1,2,3,4,5$.

None of the integers can be $0\pmod 6$, since this would make their product a multiple of 6.

The remaining possible residues are $1,2,3,4,5$. Our integers must cover all but one of these, so either 2 or 4 must be among the residues of our four integers. Therefore, at least one of the integers is even, which rules out also having a multiple of 3 (since this would again make $N$ a multiple of 6). Any integer that leaves a remainder of 3 (mod 6) is a multiple of 3, so such integers are not allowed.

Therefore, the four integers must be congruent to $1,2,4,$ and $5\pmod 6$. Their product is congruent modulo 6 to $1\cdot 2\cdot 4\cdot 5=40$, which leaves a remainder of $\boxed{4}$.

We begin by multiplying the units digit: $3_4 \times 3_4 = 9_{10} = 21_4$. So, we write down a $1$ and carry-over the $2$. Moving on to the next digit, we need to evaluate $2_4 \times 3_4 + 2_4 = 8_{10} = 20_{4}$. Thus, the next digit is a $0$ and a $2$ is carried over. Finally, the leftmost digits are given by the operation $1_4 \times 3_4 + 2_4 = 5_{10} = 11_4$. Writing this out, we have  $$\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}

Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $66$, it must be divisible by $2$, $3$ and $11$. Since $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $11$, we know $4-a+5-b+3-2$ is a multiple of $11$, so $11\mid 10-a-b$. So either $10-a-b=-11$, $10-a-b=0$, $10-a-b=11$, etc., which gives $a+b=21$, $a+b=10$, or $a+b=-1$. The only value which works is $a+b=10$, since $a$ and $b$ are digits. There are several pairs $(a,b)$ which fit this condition, but it doesn't matter which one we choose since in all cases, the quantity we want is $a+b=\boxed{10}$.

Just to be safe, we check that if $a+b=10$, the number is also divisible by $2$ and $3$. No matter what $a$ and $b$ are, $4a5,b32$ is divisible by $2$ since the units digit is even. The sum of the digits is $4+a+5+b+3+2=14+a+b=14+(10)=24$, which is divisible by $3$ so $4a5,b32$ is divisible by three. Thus our solution works.

Extracting Answer from: 
According to the divisibility rule for 9, we know that if the sum of the digits of a number is 9, then it must be divisible by 9. Additionally, we know that 9 itself is not a prime number, since it is divisible by 3. Therefore, no such number that satisfies this condition can possibly be prime because it must be divisible by 9, and thus must have at least one factor besides 1 and itself. Since a number can never be prime if the sum of its digits is 9, the probability that the number is prime is $\boxed{0}$.

We know that $\gcd(m,n) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$.  Hence, in this case, the other number is \[\frac{(x + 3) \cdot x(x + 3)}{40} = \frac{x(x + 3)^2}{40}.\] To minimize this number, we minimize $x$.

This expression is not an integer for $x =$ 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when $x = 5$, this expression is $5 \cdot 8^2/40 = 8$.

Note that that the greatest common divisor of 8 and 40 is 8, and $x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8$.  The least common multiple is 40, and $x(x + 3) = 5 \cdot (5 + 3) = 40$, so $x = 5$ is a possible value.  Therefore, the smallest possible value for the other number is $\boxed{8}$.

These numbers are all in the form $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)\pmod 4$, there will be one number of each residue, so one of the numbers will be divisible by 2 and another divisible by 4, leaving the product divisible by 8. Similarly, one of the numbers will be $0\mod 3$, so the product will be divisible by 3. The GCD must therefore be divisible by $3\cdot8=24$. It also must be less than or equal to the smallest number in the set, $1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4=24$, so it must be $\boxed{24}$ exactly.

2z+x+y&\equiv 0 \pmod{13},\\
z+2x+y&\equiv 6 \pmod{13},\\
z+x+2y&\equiv 8 \pmod {13}.
\end{align*}Adding all three together gives $4(x+y+z)\equiv 14\pmod {13}\implies x+y+z\equiv 10\pmod {13}$. Subtracting this from each results in \begin{align*}

If we first get a "common denominator" as if 3 and 13 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\frac 13 + \frac 1{13} \equiv \frac{13 + 3}{39} \equiv \frac{16}{2 \cdot 19 + 1} \equiv \frac {16}1 \equiv \boxed{16} \pmod{19}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \equiv 3^{-1} \pmod{19}$ and $b \equiv 13^{-1} \pmod{19}$. Then $39a \equiv 13 \pmod{19}$ and $39b \equiv 3 \pmod{19}$. Summing these congruences shows that $39(a+b) \equiv a+b \equiv 13 + 3 \equiv 16 \pmod{19}$, so $a+b \equiv 16 \pmod{19}$, as desired.

We first get the prime factorization of $80000$. \begin{align*}
80000 &= 8 \cdot 10^4 \\
\qquad &= 2^3 \cdot 10^4 \\
\qquad &= 2^3 \cdot 2^4 \cdot 5^4 \\
\qquad &= 2^7 \cdot 5^4
\end{align*}Therefore, we can rewrite $\frac{54317}{80000}$ as $\frac{54317}{2^7 \cdot 5^4}$. If we multiply this fraction by $10^7$, the denominator is eliminated entirely. Note that multiplying by $10^6$ is insufficient, so since $10^7$ is the smallest power of ten we can multiply this fraction by to get an integer, there are $\boxed{7}$ digits to the right of the decimal point.

Let $u=a/b$. Then the problem is equivalent to finding all positive rational numbers $u$ such that \[
u+\frac{14}{9u}=k
\]for some integer $k$. This equation is equivalent to $9u^2-9uk+14=0$, whose solutions are \[
u=\frac{9k\pm\sqrt{81k^2-504}}{18}=
\frac{k}{2}\pm\frac{1}{6}\sqrt{9k^2-56}.
\]Hence $u$ is rational if and only if $\sqrt{9k^2-56}$ is rational, which is true if and only if $9k^2-56$ is a perfect square. Suppose that $9k^2-56=s^2$ for some positive integer $s$. Then $(3k-s)(3k+s)=56$. The only factors of $56$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $7$, $8$, $14$, $28$, and $56$, so $(3k-s,3k+s)$ is one of the ordered pairs $(1,56)$, $(2,28)$, $(4,14)$, or $(7,8)$. The cases $(1,56)$ and $(7,8)$ yield no integer solutions.  The cases $(2,28)$ and $(4,14)$ yield $k=5$ and $k=3$, respectively. If $k=5$, then $u=1/3$ or $u=14/3$. If $k=3$, then $u=2/3$ or $u=7/3$. Therefore, the pairs $(a,b)$ that satisfy the given conditions are $(1,3),(2,3), (7,3),$ and $(14,3)$, for a total of $\boxed{4}$ pairs.

\end{align*}The last two numbers are $9\cdot 7!$ and $(8\cdot 10)\cdot 7!$, so their least common multiple is equal to $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9,8\cdot 10]\cdot 7!$. Since $9$ and $8\cdot 10$ are relatively prime, we have $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9,8\cdot 10] = 9\cdot 8\cdot 10$, and so $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[7!+8!,8!+9!] = 9\cdot 8\cdot 10\cdot 7! = 10!.$$Finally, we note that all the other numbers in our list ($1!+2!,2!+3!,\ldots,6!+7!$) are clearly divisors of $10!$. So, the least common multiple of all the numbers in our list is $10!$. Writing this in the form specified in the problem, we get $1\cdot 10!$, so $a=1$ and $b=10$ and their sum is $\boxed{11}$.

Note that $14$, $46$, and $100$ all have a common factor of $2$, so we can divide it out: the solutions to $$14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}$$ are identical to the solutions to $$7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.$$ Make sure you see why this is the case.

Now we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $7$ to obtain $$49u \equiv 161 \pmod{50},$$ which also has the same solutions as the previous congruence, since we could reverse the step above by multiplying both sides by $7^{-1}$. (We know that $7^{-1}$ exists modulo $50$ because $7$ and $50$ are relatively prime.)

Replacing each side of $49u\equiv 161$ by a $\pmod{50}$ equivalent, we have $$-u \equiv 11\pmod{50},$$ and thus $$u \equiv -11\pmod{50}.$$ This is the set of solutions to our original congruence. The two smallest positive solutions are $-11+50 = 39$ and $-11+2\cdot 50 = 89$. Their average is $\boxed{64}$.

An integer is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  Because $2+0+0+4=6$ is divisible by 3, 2004 is divisible by 3.  Also, the last two digits of 2004 form a multiple of 4, so 2004 is divisible by 4 as well. Therefore, 2004 is divisible by 12 and hence leaves a remainder of $\boxed{0}$ when divided by 12.

Extracting Answer from: 
Notice that $3^{17} + 3^{10} = 3^{10} \cdot (3^7 + 1)$; thus $9$ divides into $3^{17} + 3^{10}$. Furthermore, using the sum of seventh powers factorization, it follows that $3+1 = 4$ divides into $3^7 + 1$.

Using the divisibility criterion for $4$, we know that $\overline{AB}$ must be divisible by $4$. Thus $B$ is even and not divisible by $3$. Also, $A$ is odd, so $\overline{AB} = 10A + B$, where $4$ does not divide into $10A$. Thus, $4$ cannot divide into $B$ either, otherwise $10A + B$ would not be divisible by $4$. Then, $B$ must be equal to $2$.

Using the divisibility criterion for $9$, it follows that $3(A+B+C)$ is divisible by $9$, that is $3$ divides into $A+C+2$. Thus, $A+C = 4,7,10,13,16 \quad (*)$. Using the divisibility criterion for $11$, since \begin{align*}10^{8} \cdot A + 10^7 \cdot B + \cdots + B &\equiv (-1)^8 \cdot A + (-1)^7 \cdot B + \cdots + B \\ &\equiv A - B + \cdots + B \\ &\equiv -1 \pmod{11},\end{align*}then the alternating sum of digits, which works out to be $B+C-A \equiv -1 \pmod{11}$. Thus, $2+C-A$ is either equal to $10$ or $-1$, so $A-C = 3,-8$.

In the former case when $A-C = 3$, summing with $(*)$ yields that $2A \in \{7,10,13,16,19\}$, of which only $A = 5$ fit the problem conditions. This yields that $C = 2$. However, we know that $B$ and $C$ are distinct, so we can eliminate this possibility. Thus, $A-C = -8$, of which only $C = 9, A = 1$ works. The answer is $\boxed{129}$.

$100A + 10B + C = (3^{16} - 3^{9})A + 3^{12}B + (3^{16} + 3^{9})C$. Observe that $3^{16} \equiv 1\pmod{11}$ and $3^{9} \equiv -1\pmod{11}$. Thus, $(3^{16} - 3^{9})A + (3^{16} + 3^{9})C \equiv 2 \cdot 1 \cdot A + 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot C \equiv -2C + 2A\pmod{11}$. Since $n\equiv -1 \pmod{11}$, $-(2C-2A) + 3^{12}B \equiv -1\pmod{11}$, or $2C - 2A - 3^{12}B \equiv 1\pmod{11}$. Testing the ten possible residues of $B$ mod 11, we see that $B$ must be $5$. Now $2C - 2A \equiv 4 \pmod{11}$, so $C$ and $A$ are congruent to 2 and 7 in some order. And since $C$ and $A$ must be odd, we have $C=7$ and $A=3$. Therefore $100A + 10B + C = \boxed{375}$.

The student will answer a question correctly if

Case 1: both the student and the answer key say it is true. This happens when the answer is NOT a multiple of 3 but IS a multiple of 4.

Case 2. both the student and the answer key say it is false. This happens when the answer IS a multiple of 3 but is NOT a multiple of 4.

Since the LCM of 3 and 4 is 12, the divisibility of numbers (in our case, correctness of answers) will repeat in cycles of 12. In the first 12 integers, $4$ and $8$ satisfy Case 1 and $3,6,$ and $9$ satisfy Case 2, so for every group of 12, the student will get 5 right answers. Since there are 8 full groups of 12 in 100, the student will answer at least $8 \cdot 5 = 40$ questions correctly. However, remember that we must also consider the leftover numbers 97, 98, 99, 100 and out of these, $99$ and $100$ satisfy one of the cases.

Here's how to get there:

Since $b^2$ is written as $121_c$, $b$ must be either $c+1$ or $c-1$. However, $b$ can't be equal to $c$ since $b$ and $c$ are both positive integers. We now consider the two possibilities: 

Case 1: $b = c+1$ 
If $b = c+1$, we can rewrite $b^2$ as $(c+1)^2 = c^2 + 2c + 1$. This means we have $2c + 1 = (c+2)c$, or $c^2 - c - 1 = 0$. The positive solution to this quadratic is $c = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, but $c$ must be a positive integer, so this case doesn't work.

Case 2: $b = c-1$
If $b = c-1$, we can rewrite $b^2$ as $(c-1)^2 = c^2 - 2c + 1$. This means we have $-2c + 1 = (c-7)b$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $c > 7$. We can rewrite $-2c + 1$ as $b(c-7) - 49b + 49b$. This gives us $b(c-7) - 49b + 1 = 0$, or $b = \frac{49}{c-7}$. Since $b$ is a positive integer, $c-7$ must divide $49$. The possibilities for $c$ are $8, 10, 16, 18, 56$. Trying each of these values, we find that only $c=16$ yields a positive integer value of $b$. 

We can now check that $c^2$ written in base $b$ is indeed equal to $71_b$. We have $c^2 = 256$, which can be written in base $b$ as $100_b + 20_b + 1_b$, or $101_b + 70_b$. Thus, $c^2$ written in base $b$ is $71_b$. 

Therefore, $b+c = 16+5 = 21$.

Since no number less than 11 divides $30N + 7$ while $N < 7$, we only need to check when $30N + 7 \ge 11^2$.  When $N = 4$, $30N + 7 = 127$ is prime.  When $N = 5$, $30N + 7 = 157$ is prime.  However, when $N = \boxed{6}$, $30N + 7 = 187 = 11 \cdot 17$ is composite.

We can write $\frac{123}{999}$ as $0.\overline{123}$. To see why, let $x=0.\overline{123}$, and subtract $x$ from $1000x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&1000x &=& 123&.123123123\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.123123123\ldots \\
\hline
&999x &=& 123 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{123} = \frac{123}{999}$.

This decimal repeats every 3 digits. Since $123{,}999$ is divisible by $3$ (as the sum of the digits of $123{,}999$ is equal to $33$), it follows that $123{,}999^{\rm th}$ digit after the decimal point is the same as the third digit after the decimal point, namely $\boxed{3}$.

An integer congruent to $7 \pmod{19}$ can be written as $19n+7$. Therefore, we have the inequality $$100 \le 19n+7 \le 999.$$We solve for the inequality by subtracting each term by $7$ and then dividing by $19$ to get  $$93\le 19n \le 992 \implies \frac{93}{19} \le n \le \frac{992}{19}.$$The smallest integer greater than $\frac{93}{19}$ is $5$ and the largest integer less than $\frac{992}{19}$ is $52$.

If $n = 6$, then $\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1) = \gcd(13,13) = 13$, which shows that the value of 13 is attainable.  Therefore, the greatest possible value of $\gcd(n + 7, 2n + 1)$ is $\boxed{13}$.

When subtracting, we notice that we can't perform the subtraction of the right-most digits unless we borrow. However, we cannot borrow from the $6$'s digit, since it is $0$, so we must borrow from the $36$'s digit. Borrowing allows us to replace $1 \cdot 36^2 + 0 \cdot 6 + 1$ with $0 \cdot 36 + 6 \cdot 6 + 1$, which in turn we can borrow to replace with $0 \cdot 36 + 5 \cdot 6 + 7$. Now, we can subtract directly to find that: $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{\ }c@{\ }c@{\ }c} & & & \cancelto{0}{1} & \cancelto{5}{0} & \cancelto{7}{1}_{6} \\ &- & & & 3 & 2_{6} \\ \cline{2-6} && & & 2 & 5_{6} \\ \end{array}$$Thus, the answer is $\boxed{25_{6}}$.

We should begin by converting $527_{10}$ to base 4. The largest power of 4 that is less than $527$ is $4^4$, which equals $256$. Since, $(2\cdot 4^4)=512<527<(3\cdot 4^4)=768$, the digit in the $4^4$ place is $2$. We know that $527-512=15$, so there will be zeros in the $4^3$ place and $4^2$ place. The largest multiple of $4^1$ that goes into $15$ without going over is $3\cdot 4^1=12$, so $3$ will be the digit in the $4^1$ place. Since $15-12=3$, we can also see that $3$ will be the digit in the $4^0$ place. We now know that $527_{10}=20033_{4}$. The sum of the digits of $20033_{4}$ is $2+0+0+3+3=\boxed{8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the five-digit number must be divisible by each of its non-zero digits. We should include the digit zero since it does not have to be included as a possible divisor and it will keep the integer smaller. Knowing this, the least possible five-digit number that we could try is $10,234$. Any number we choose will be divisible by one. We also see that it is even, and therefore, divisible by two. However, the two-digit number formed by its last two digit ($34$) is not divisible by four, and therefore, neither is the five-digit number. We also see that the sum of the five digits is $10$, and since $10$ is not divisible by three, neither is the five-digit number. However, notice that by increasing the five-digit number by two to form the number $10,236$, we create another even number and increase the digit-sum to $12$ (which takes care of the number being divisible by three). We have now eliminated the digit of four and added the digit of six, which is fine because $10,236$ being divisible by both two and three means that it is divisible by six. Our five-digit number is $\boxed{10,\!236}$.

$200,000$ is equal to $2^5\cdot 5^5$, so to find the GCF we need only take care of the $20!$. Separating this factorial into its prime factorization we can count the amount of $2$s, $3$s, $5$s, etc. that divide 20! (which is equivalent to adding up the amount of 2s, 3s, 5s, etc. on the prime quick list. Pairing these factors up with the prime factorization of 200,000, we see that $2^5\cdot 5^5$ is the greatest common factor. 

Therefore, the answer is $2^5\cdot 5^5$.

We can line up the numbers and add just as we do in base 10.  For example, when we sum the digits in the rightmost column, we get a sum of 4. Since 4 divided by 2 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0, we leave 0 as the rightmost digit of the sum and carry 2 to the next column. Continuing in this way, we find $$\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1_2 \\
& & & 1 & 1 & 1_2 \\
& & & & 1 & 1_2 \\
& + & & & & 1_2 \\
\cline{2-6}
& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0_2, \\
\end{array}$$so the sum is $\boxed{11010_2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Write $x$ in the form $10a + b$, where $b$ is the units digit of $x$ and $a$ is the "remaining" part of $x$.  (For example, if $x = 5718$, then $a = 571$ and $b = 8$.)  Then \[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2.\]Since the older brother was the last brother to receive a whole payment of $\$10$, the tens digit of $x^2$ must be odd.  The tens digit of $100a^2$ is 0, and the tens digit of $20ab$ is even, so for the tens digit of \[x^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2\]to be odd, the tens digit of $b^2$ must be odd.

We know that $b$ is a digit from 0 to 9.  Checking these digits, we find that the tens digit of $b^2$ is odd only for $b = 4$ and $b = 6$.

We also see that the units digit of $x^2$ is the same as the units digit of $b^2$.  For both $b = 4$ and $b = 6$, the units digit of $b^2$ is 6.  Therefore, the last payment to the younger brother was $\boxed{6}$ dollars.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that an integer is called square-free if the only exponent which appears in the prime factorization of the integer is $1.$ For example, $2\cdot3\cdot11$ is square-free, but $7^3\cdot13$ and $2^2\cdot3$ are not. We define the "square-free part" of a positive integer which is not a perfect square to be largest square-free factor of the integer. For example, the square-free part of $18$ is $6,$ and the square-free part of $54$ is $6.$ Perfect squares have a square-free part of $1.$

Notice that two positive integers multiply to give a perfect square if and only if either their square free parts are equal or the integers are both perfect squares. Therefore, if we look at the square free parts of the integers between $1$ and $16,$ the maximum number of slips that Jillian can draw is the number of distinct square free parts that appear. The table below (broken into two lines) shows the square-free parts of the integers between $1$ and $16.$ \begin{tabular}{cccccccc}

We know that the prime factors of the set of numbers must equal the prime factors of 84, which are $2^2\cdot3\cdot7$. The set with the smallest sum would be the factors themselves - 2, 2, 3, and 7. However, the set can't have two 2's since the integers must be distinct, but it can have a 4, 3, and 7 instead.  The sum of those numbers is $\boxed{14}$.  We could also have paired one of the 2's with the 3, to have 2, 6, and 7, but these have sum 15.

Original File: 4-7-MATH-test-answers/test/number_theory/209.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We could use long division to find the decimal representations of the three fractions, but there's a slicker way.

We begin by finding an equivalent fraction whose denominator is 1 less than a power of 10. Take $\frac{3}{11}$, for example. We can multiply the numerator and denominator by 9 to rewrite this number as $\frac{27}{99}$. Now, we can rewrite this fraction as $0.\overline{27}$. To see why, let $x=0.\overline{27}$, and subtract $x$ from $100x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&100x &=& 27&.272727\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.272727\ldots \\
\hline
&99x &=& 27 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{27} = \frac{27}{99}$.

We can apply the same trick to our other fractions. For $\frac{4}{37}$, we have to recognize that $37\cdot 27 = 999$, allowing us to write $\frac{4}{37}$ as $\frac{4\cdot 27}{37\cdot 27} = \frac{108}{999}$. Now the trick above yields $\frac{4}{37} = 0.\overline{108}$.

To deal with $\frac{23}{9}$, we first write it as $2+\frac{5}{9}$. The trick we used for the other two fractions then gives $\frac{23}{9} = 2+0.\overline{5} = 2.\overline{5}$.

Finally, we find the first six digits after the decimal point of the sum.  $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}& & 2 &. &\stackrel{1}{5} & \stackrel{1}{5} & \stackrel{1}{5} & 5 & \stackrel{2}{5} & 5\\& & &. &2 &7 & 2 & 7& 2 & 7\\&+ & &. & 1 &0 & 8 & 1 & 0 & 8\\ \hline & &2 & .& 9 &3 & 6 & 3 & 9 & 0\\ \end{array} $$ We should check that in adding the seventh digits after the decimal point, nothing is carried over to affect the sixth digit. Notice that continuing the addition past the first six digits will result in repeating blocks of the same six digits ($.555555+.272727+.108108=.936390$). That means the seventh digit will be a 9 (same as the first digit after the decimal point) and there is nothing carried over to affect the sixth digit. So, the sum $a+b+c+d+e+f$ is $9+3+6+3+9+0=\boxed{30}$.

The residue of $4n\pmod 6$ is determined by the residue of $n\pmod 6.$ We can build a table showing the possibilities: $$\begin{array}{r || c * 5 {| c}}
n\pmod 6 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
\hline
4n\pmod 6 & 0 & 4 & 2 & 0 & 4 & 2
\end{array}$$As the table shows, $4n\equiv 2\pmod 6$ is true when $n\equiv 2$ or $n\equiv 5\pmod 6.$ Otherwise, it's false.

So, our problem is to count all $n$ between $0$ and $60$ that leave a remainder of $2$ or $5$ modulo $6.$ These integers are $$2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \ldots, 56, 59.$$There are $\boxed{20}$ integers in this list.

We can re-write the given expression as $(16 \times 17 \times 18)^{17} \times 17 \times 18^2$. First, we find the units digit of $(16 \times 17 \times 18)^{17}$. The units digit of $16 \times 17 \times 18$ is that of $6 \times 7 \times 8,$ or that of $2 \times 8$, or $6$. When raised to any perfect power, a positive integer ending in $6$ will still end in $6$, so $(16 \times 17 \times 18)^{17}$ has a units digit of $6$. Now, we need to find the units digit of $6 \times 17 \times 18^2$, or the units digit of $2 \times 18^2$, which is $\boxed{8}$.

The largest power of $13$ which is smaller than $53$ is $13$, and the largest multiple of $13$ less than $53$ is $4\cdot 13$. $53-4 \cdot 13= 1$.

To minimize our work, we may begin by rewriting $3^{-1}+5^{-1}$ in the following way: \begin{align*}
3^{-1}+5^{-1} &\equiv 5\cdot 5^{-1}\cdot 3^{-1} + 3\cdot 3^{-1}\cdot 5^{-1} \\
&\equiv 5\cdot 15^{-1} + 3\cdot 15^{-1} \\
&\equiv (5+3)\cdot 15^{-1} \\
&\equiv 8\cdot 15^{-1},
\end{align*}where all congruence is modulo $31$. Notice that this process is just like finding a common denominator!

Now we wish to find the inverse of $8\cdot 15^{-1}$. This inverse must be $15\cdot 8^{-1}$, since $$8\cdot 15^{-1}\cdot 15\cdot 8^{-1} \equiv 8\cdot 1\cdot 8^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{31}.$$Finally, we note that $8^{-1}\equiv 4\pmod{31}$, since $8\cdot 4 = 32\equiv 1\pmod{31}$. Therefore, we have \begin{align*}
(3^{-1}+5^{-1})^{-1} &\equiv 15\cdot 8^{-1} \\
&\equiv 15\cdot 4 \\
&\equiv 60 \\
&\equiv \boxed{29} \quad\pmod{31}.

Since any positive integer(expressed in base ten) is some multiple of $5$ plus its last digit, its remainder when divided by $5$ can be obtained by knowing its last digit.

Note that $1999^1$ ends in $9,$ $1999^2$ ends in $1,$ $1999^3$ ends in $9,$ $1999^4$ ends in $1,$ and this alternation of $9$ and $1$ endings continues with all even powers ending in $1.$ Therefore, the remainder when $1999^{2000}$ is divided by $5$ is $\boxed{1}.$

Instead of adding up the sum and finding the residue, we can find the residue of each number to make computation easier.

Each group of 6 numbers would have the sum of residues $1+2+3+4+5+0 \equiv 15 \equiv 3 \pmod6$.

There are $\left\lfloor\frac{100}{6}\right\rfloor=16$ sets of $6$ numbers. This leaves the numbers $97,98,99,$ and $100$, which have the residues $1,2,3,$ and $4$. Adding together all the residues, we have $3 \cdot 16 + 1+2+3+4 \equiv 58 \equiv \boxed{4} \pmod6$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First of all, we notice that $11 = 1 + 10,$ and so we write $11^n$ as follows: $$(1 + 10)^n = \binom{n}{0} \cdot 1^n + \binom{n}{1} \cdot 1^{n-1} \cdot 10^{1} + \binom{n}{2} \cdot 1^{n-2} \cdot 10^{2} + \cdots$$ We can see that every term after the first two in our expansion has at least two powers of $10,$ therefore they will not contribute to the tens digit of anything. Meanwhile, the first term is always $1,$ and the second term can be simplified to $10n.$

Therefore, we have: \begin{align*}
&11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \cdots + 11^9 \\
&\qquad\equiv (1 + 10) + (1 + 20) + \cdots + (1 + 90) \pmod{100}. \\
&\qquad\equiv 459 \equiv 59 \pmod{100}.

The marbles will be grouped into piles of 10.  We might as well group the number of marbles each of Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe brought into as many piles of 10 as possible before sorting out the rest.

174 &\equiv 4 \pmod{10} \\

\end{align*}  Our goal is to find the modulo 10 residue of the total number of marbles.  We find this by adding the residues above: $9 + 4 + 3 = 16 \equiv \boxed{6} \pmod{10}$.  Since we were working in modulo 10, this is the same as a units digit calculation.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, $2005^2 = 4020025$, so the last two digits of $2005^2$ are 25.

We need to look at $2005^5$, but since we only need the final two digits, we don't actually have to calculate this number entirely.

Consider $2005^3 = 2005^2 \times 2005 = 4020025 \times 2005$.  When we carry out this multiplication, the last two digits of the product will only depend on the last two digits of the each of the two numbers being multiplied (try this by hand!), so the last two digits of $2005^3$ are the same as the last two digits of $25 \times 5 = 125$, ie. are 25.

Similarly, to calculate $2005^4$, we multiply $2005^3$ (which ends in 25) by $2005$, so by the same reasoning $2005^4$ ends in 25. Similarly, $2005^5$ ends in 25.

Therefore, $2005^2$ and $2005^5$ both end in 25.

Also, $2005^0 = 1$, so the expression overall is equal to $$\ldots 25 + 1 + 1 + \ldots 25 = \ldots 52.$$Therefore, the final two digits are $\boxed{52}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 6, $m = 6x$ and $n = 6y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 6x + 6y = 6(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.

The LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $126=2\cdot3^2\cdot7= 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 3 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 3 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $6(3 + 7) = \boxed{60}$.

We can rewrite $31_b$ as $3b+1$ in base 10. So, we have $P\cdot P=3b+1$. The value of $P$ is one less than $b$, so we substitute $(b-1)$ for $P$ and get \begin{align*}
(b-1)^2&=3b+1\quad\Rightarrow\\
b^2-2b+1&=3b+1\quad\Rightarrow\\
b^2-5b&=0\quad\Rightarrow\\
b(b-5)&=0.
\end{align*}That means $b=0$ or $b=5$, but a base of 0 would mean $P=-1$ and the multiplication problem would not be true. So, the base $b$ is $\boxed{5}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let us first analyze the fraction $\frac{17k}{66}$. We can rewrite this fraction as $\frac{17k}{2 \cdot 3 \cdot 11}$. Since the denominator can only contain powers of 2 and 5, we have that $k$ must be a multiple of 33. We now continue to analyze the fraction $\frac{13k}{105}$. We rewrite this fraction as $\frac{13k}{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7}$, and therefore deduce using similar logic that $k$ must be a multiple of 21. From here, we proceed to find the least common multiple of 21 and 33. Since $21 = 3 \cdot 7$ and $33 = 3 \cdot 11$, we conclude that the least common multiple of 21 and 33 is $3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 = 231$.

We now know that $S$ contains exactly the multiples of 231. The smallest multiple of 231 that is greater than 2010 is $231 \cdot 9 = \boxed{2079}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can simplify $\frac{19}{t}+\frac{5}{t}$ as $\frac{19+5}{t}$, or $\frac{24}{t}$. So, in order for this expression to have an integral value, 24 must be divisible by $t$. In other words, $t$ must be a factor of 24. Therefore, to find the number of positive integers $t$ that will make the expression have an integral value, we just need to find the number of factors of 24. We know that if $ n ={p_{1}}^{e_{1}}\cdot{p_{2}}^{e_{2}}\cdot{p_{3}}^{e_{3}}\cdots{p_{k}}^{e_{k}} $, where $p_1, p_2...p_k$ are prime numbers, then the number of factors of $n$ is equal to $(e_1+1)(e_2+1)(e_3+1)\cdots(e_k+1)$. We have that the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3\cdot3^1$, so using the formula above, 24 has $(3+1)(1+1)=\boxed{8}$ factors.

The same is true for other bases, since the base divides the place value of each digit to the left of the ones digit.

We notice that $455 = 5 \cdot 91$, so it follows that if $n$ divides into $91$, then it must divide into $455$. Then, we only need to find the factors of $91$, which are $\{1,7,13,91\}$. Summing the factors other than $1$ gives $7 + 13 + 91 = \boxed{111}$.

Note that \begin{align*}
1342 &= 1300+39+3 \\
&= 13(100+3)+3,
\end{align*}so $r=3$.

We are seeking the smallest multiple of $1342$ that is congruent to $0$, $1$, or $2$ modulo $13$.

We have $1342n \equiv 3n\pmod{13}$, so the remainders of the first four multiples of $1342$ are $3,6,9,12$. The next number in this sequence is $15$, but $15$ reduces to $2$ modulo $13$. That is: $$5\cdot 1342 \equiv 5\cdot 3 \equiv 2\pmod{13}.$$Therefore, the number we are looking for is $5\cdot 1342 = \boxed{6710}$.

Taking the given equation modulo 1399 gives \[35\cdot40\equiv1\pmod{1399},\]so we know that 35 is the multiplicative inverse to 40.  We want to use this to find the multiplicative inverse to $4\cdot40=160$, so we want to try to "divide" 35 by 4.

The difficulty in dividing by 4 is that 35 is odd.  We do know, though, that  \[35\equiv35+1399\equiv1434\pmod{1399}\]and this number is even!  Let's go even further, though, to find a multiple of 4: \[35\equiv35+3\cdot1399\equiv4232\pmod{1399}.\]Factoring 4 we get  \[35\equiv4\cdot1058\pmod{1399}.\]Finally we multiply by 40: \[1\equiv 40\cdot35\equiv40\cdot4\cdot1058\equiv160\cdot1058\pmod{1399}.\]This argument is inelegant.  Let's write it in a more clear order: \begin{align*}
1058\cdot160&\equiv1058\cdot(4\cdot40)\\
&\equiv(1058\cdot4)\cdot40\\
&\equiv35\cdot40\\

$(666)_7 = (6\cdot 7^2)+(6\cdot 7)+6$. Since any three-digit number in base $7$ is at most $6\cdot 7^2+6\cdot 7+6$, the hundreds digit of $A$ must be $6$ and the hundreds digit of $B$ must be $0$. Then $A=6xy$ and $B=xyz$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are digits from $0$ to $6$. We need to solve $666_7=6(7^2x+7y+z)+7(6x+y)+6z$, which simplifies to $97x+48y+7z=54$. Checking residues mod $7$, we find that $6x \equiv 5 \pmod{7}$, so the only solutions for $x$ are $5$ and $12$. If $x=5$, then $y=1$ and $z=5$, and if $x=12$, then $y=2$ and $z=6$. Thus there are $\boxed{2}$ ordered pairs.

If you notice carefully, the two sequences of digits never both have a $1$ in the same place. Thus, whether you add them in base $10$ or binary, the resulting sequence of digits is the same. Thus whether we add them in base $10$ or add them in binary and interpret the digits in base $10$, we get the same result, so the difference is $\boxed{0}$.

Let's find the cycle of the final three digits of $5^n$, starting with $n=3$ : $125, 625, 125, 625,\ldots$ . The cycle of the final three digits of $5^{n}$ is 2 numbers long: 125, 625. Thus, to find the final three digits of $5^n$ for any positive $n\ge3$, we must find the remainder, $R$, when $n$ is divided by 2 ($R=1$ corresponds to 125, and $R=0$ corresponds to 625). Since $100\div2=50$ without remainder, the final three digits of $5^{100}$ are 625. Their sum is $6+2+5=\boxed{13}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.

If the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is
\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \dotsm (e_n + 1).\]Note that $e_i \ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.

If $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$

Otherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:
\[20 = 2 \cdot 10 = 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5.\]Thus, we have the following cases:

(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$

(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\cdot3.$

(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3^3=432.$

(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3\cdot5=240.$

Therefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\boxed{240}$ tiles.

We can perform the Euclidean Algorithm two times.

First, we use it for $3339$ and $2961$. \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(3339,2961) &=\text{gcd}\,(3339-2961,2961)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(378,2961)\\

&=\text{gcd}\,(378,315)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(378-315,315)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(63,315)\\
\end{align*}Since $63$ is a divisor of $315$, the greatest common divisor of $3339$ and $2961$ is $63$.

Next, we can find the greatest common divisor of $63$ and $1491$, also using the Euclidean Algorithm. \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}\,(63,1491) &=\text{gcd}\,(63,1491-63 \cdot 23)\\
&=\text{gcd}\,(63,42)\\

We start subtract the rightmost digits, keeping in mind that we are in base $5$.

Since $1$ is less than $4$, we must borrow $1$ from the $2$, which then becomes $1$. Since $11_5-4_5=2_5$, we have $2$ in the rightmost digit. Since the $1$ left over is less than $3$, we must borrow $1$ from the $3$, which becomes a $2$. Next, $11_5-3_5=3_5$, so we have $3$ in the second rightmost digit. Since $2-2=0$, the third digit is 0. We subtract $1$ from $4$ to get $3$ for the fourth digit. In column format, this process reads $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & &4 & \cancelto{2}{3}& \cancelto{1}{2} & 1_5\\ & -& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4_5\\ \cline{2-6} & & 3 & 0 & 3& 2_5\\ \end{array} $$The difference is $\boxed{3032_5}$.

Let $a$ be the number of apples that Sophia originally had. Clearly $a=6b$ for some positive integer $b$. Additionally, $a-1\equiv 0\pmod n\implies 6b\equiv 1\pmod n$. This is solvable for $b$ if and only if $6$ is invertible modulo $n$. In other words, $\gcd(6,n)=1$. The only such $n$ less than $10$ are $1,5,7$, so there are $\boxed{3}$ possibilities for $n$.

We know that $6^{4}>999_{10}>6^{3}$. So, we can tell that $999_{10}$ in base six will have four digits. $6^{3}=216$, which can go into 999 four times at most, leaving $999-4\cdot216 = 135$ for the next three digits. $6^{2}=36$ goes into 135 three times at most, leaving us with $135-3\cdot36 = 27$. Then, $6^{1}=6$ goes into 27 four times at most, leaving $27-4\cdot6 = 3$ for the ones digit. All together, the base six equivalent of $999_{10}$ is $\boxed{4343_6}$.

Recall the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Thus, $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{\gcd(9999,100001)},$$so we focus on computing $\gcd(9999,100001)$.

Notice that $100001 = 99990+11 = 10(9999)+11$. Therefore, any common divisor of $100001$ and $9999$ must be a divisor of $100001-10\cdot 9999 = 11$. The possibilities are $1$ and $11$.

In fact, $9999=11\cdot 909$, so $11$ is a divisor of $9999$ and $100001$, which gives $\gcd(9999,100001) = 11$.

Therefore, \begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] &= \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{11} \\
&= 909\cdot 100001 \\
&= 909\cdot 100000 + 909 \\
&= \boxed{90{,}900{,}909}.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the pattern of the sequence, we begin by converting each of the decimal values into a common fraction. The first term $0$ is equal to $\frac{0}{1}$. The next term, $0.5$, can be written as $\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}$. To express $0.\overline{6}$ as a common fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$:

$$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& 6&.66666\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.66666\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& 6 &
\end{array}$$

This shows that $0.\overline{6} = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3}$. The fourth term in the series, $0.75$, becomes $\frac{75}{100}=\frac{3}{4}$. Thus, when we write fractions instead of decimals, our sequence is: $$\frac{0}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{3}{4}, \cdots$$  By observing this sequence, we realize that the first term of the sequence is $\frac{0}{1}$ and each successive term is found by adding $1$ to both the numerator and denominator of the previous term. Thus, the next term in the sequence is $\frac{3+1}{4+1}=\frac{4}{5}=\boxed{0.8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, for simplicity, let's make all the amounts of money into integers by considering them all in cents. For example, $\$5.43$ becomes 543. Let the purchase price be $A=A_1A_2A_3$ and the amount of change be $B_1B_2B_3$ where $A_1$ represents the first digit of $A$, $B_1$ represents the first digit of $B$, $A_2$ represents the second digit of $A$, etc.

We know that $A+B=1000$, and we can conclude that $A_1+B_1=9$ because if $A_1+B_1<9$ then $A+B<1000$ and if $A_1+B_1=10$ then $A_2=B_2=A_3=B_3=0$, but then the only way that B can be a rearrangement of the digits of A is if $A_1=B_1=5$, which means $A=B=500$, but the problem states that the price and the amount of change are different.

Since 9 is odd, we can also conclude that $A_1$ and $B_1$ are distinct, which, using the fact that $A$'s digits can be rearranged to get B's digits, implies that $A_1=B_2$ or $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_2$ or $B_1=A_3$. We can also observe that A and B have the same remainder when divided by 9 because the remainder when $n$ is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of the digits of $n$ is divided by 9 for all $n$ and the sum of the digits of A is obviously equal to the sum of the digits of B.

Since the remainder when 1000 is divided by 9 is 1, we can in fact conclude that the remainder when A and B are divided by 9 (and when the sum of their digits is divided by 9) is 5. Keeping in mind that two of the digits of $A$ are $A_1$ and $B_1$ and that $A_1+B_1=9$, we can conclude that the other digit is 5, which is the only digit that would result in the sum having a remainder of 5 when divided by 9. By similar logic we can conclude that 5 is also one of the digits of $B$. A little thought makes it clear that at least one of these 5's appears as the last digit in its number (that is, $A_3=5$ or $B_3=5$) since if neither of them appears as the last digit in a number, then $A_1=B_3$ and $B_1=A_3$ and $A_3+B_3=9\Rightarrow A+B$ ends in a 9, which is a contradiction. But if $A_3=5$ then the only way for the sum of $A$ and $B$ to end in a 0 is for $B_3=5$, so we can conclude that $A_3=B_3=5$, $A_1=B_2$, and $A_2=B_1$. So once we have picked a value for $A_1$, the other 5 digits are all determined. Since both amounts are greater than a dollar, we know that $A_1$ can be any number between 1 and 8 for a total of 8 possible prices (and thus 8 possible amounts of change). To double check, we can work out $A$ and $B$ for each value of $A_1$ and reconvert them to dollars to make sure that the price and the amount of change satisfy the given conditions:

$A_1=1\Rightarrow A=\$1.85, B=\$8.15$;

$A_1=2\Rightarrow A=\$2.75, B=\$7.25$;

$A_1=3\Rightarrow A=\$3.65, B=\$6.35$;

$A_1=4\Rightarrow A=\$4.55, B=\$5.45$;

$A_1=5\Rightarrow A=\$5.45, B=\$4.55$;

$A_1=6\Rightarrow A=\$6.35, B=\$3.65$;

$A_1=7\Rightarrow A=\$7.25, B=\$2.75$; and finally

$A_1=8\Rightarrow A=\$8.15, B=\$1.85$.

This confirms that there are $\boxed{8}$ possible amounts of change.

Extracting Answer from: 
First we consider integers that have $2$ digits in base $2$ and $1$ digit in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $10_2 = 2$, but strictly less than $10_3 = 3$. The only such integer is $2$.

Next we consider integers that have $4$ digits in base $2$ and $2$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $1000_2 = 2^3$, but strictly less than $100_3 = 3^2$. The only such integer is $8$.

Next we consider integers that have $6$ digits in base $2$ and $3$ digits in base $3$. Such an integer must be greater than or equal to $100000_2 = 2^5$, but strictly less than $1000_3 = 3^3$. There are no such integers, because $2^5 > 3^3$.

If we continue in this fashion, we may come to suspect that there are no more solutions of any length. Let us prove this. If an integer $N$ has $2d$ digits in base $2$, then $N\ge 2^{2d-1}$. But if $N$ has only $d$ digits in base $3$, then $N<3^d$. A mutual solution is possible only if $$2^{2d-1}<3^d.$$We can rearrange this inequality as $$\left(\frac 43\right)^d < 2.$$By inspection, this inequality is valid for $d=1,2$ but invalid for $d=3$, and also invalid for any larger $d$ since the left side increases as $d$ increases.

Since $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = 108 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3$, we know $m = 2^a \cdot 3^b$ and $n = 2^c \cdot 3^d$ for some positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  Furthermore, $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = \mathop{\text{lcm}}[2^a \cdot 3^b, 2^c \cdot 3^d] = 2^{\max\{a,c\}} \cdot 3^{\max\{b,d\}}$, so $\max\{a,c\} = 2$ and $\max\{b,d\} = 3$.

Also, $\gcd(m,n) = 2$, but $\gcd(m,n) = \gcd(2^a \cdot 3^b, 2^c \cdot 3^d) = 2^{\min\{a,c\}} \cdot 3^{\min\{b,d\}}$, so $\min\{a,c\} = 1$ and $\min\{b,d\} = 0$.

There are only 2 pairs $(a,c)$ that satisfy $\min\{a,c\} = 1$ and $\max\{a,c\} = 2$, namely $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.  There are only 2 pairs $(b,d)$ that satisfy $\min\{b,d\} = 0$ and $\max\{b,d\} = 3$, namely $(0,3)$ and $(3,0)$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$(m,n)=(2a,2b)$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[m,n] = 108 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3$. Therefore, $2^2 \cdot 3^3 = 2a\cdot2b \cdot \gcd(a,b) = 4ab\cdot\gcd(a,b)$. Now $\gcd(a,b)$ must divide $3^3$ and be odd, so $\gcd(a,b)$ must be one of $1, 3, 9$. Thus either $\{\gcd(a,b),ab\} = \{1,2^2 \cdot 3^2\}$ or $\{\gcd(a,b),ab\} = \{3,2^2 \cdot 3\}$.
So for the first case we have $3$ choices for $\gcd(a,b)$. Once $\gcd(a,b)$ is chosen $ab$ is uniquely determined as $2^2 \cdot 3^2 / \gcd(a,b)$. Therefore, there are
$$3\cdot \tau(2^2 \cdot 3^2)=84$$
such pairs $(m,n)$.
For the second case, we have $3$ choices for $\gcd(a,b)$. Once $\gcd(a,b)$ is chosen $ab$ is uniquely determined as $2^2 \cdot 3 / \gcd(a,b)$. Therefore, there are
$$3\cdot \tau(2^2 \cdot 3)=36$$
such pairs.
Hence the answer is $84+36=\boxed{120}$.

The common difference of the arithmetic sequence 106, 116, 126, ..., 996 is relatively prime to 3.  Therefore, given any three consecutive terms, exactly one of them is divisible by 3.  Since there are $1+(996-106)/10=90$ terms in the sequence, $90/3=30$ of them are divisible by 3.  Since every term is even, a term is divisible by 3 if and only if it is divisible by 6.  Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected term in the sequence is a multiple of 6 is $30/90=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

There are many ways to solve this problem, the most obvious being to list all of the proper divisors and add them up. There is, however, a creative solution that uses the fact that the sum of the proper divisors of 18 is 21. Note that we can factor 198 into $11\cdot 18=11\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 3$. Each proper divisor will be composed of three or fewer of these factors. Those divisors that do not contain the factor 11 will be either the proper divisors of 18 or 18 itself, contributing 21 and 18, respectively, to the sum. Those divisors that do contain the factor 11 will again by the proper divisors of 18, only multiplied by 11. The sum of these divisors, therefore, is $11\cdot 21=231$. Since these are all possible divisors, the sum of the proper divisors of 198 is $21+18+231=\boxed{270}$.

We need to find a pattern in $T$ first. You may have heard of it by the name Fibonacci sequence. Reduced modulo $7$ (we can still use the recurrence relation), it looks like \[T\equiv \{0,1,1,2,3,5,1,6,0,6,6,5,4,2,6,1,0,1\ldots\}.\]The first $16$ terms are $\{0,1,1,2,3,5,1,6,0,6,6,5,4,2,6,1\}.$ As the next two are $0$ and $1$ and since the sequence is defined by recursion on the most recent two terms, the Fibonacci sequence modulo $7$ consists of repetitions of $0,$ $1,$ $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $1,$ $6,$ $0,$ $6,$ $6,$ $5,$ $4,$ $2,$ $6,$ $1.$ Now \[\begin{cases}
a\equiv 5\pmod {16}\implies t_a\equiv 5\pmod 7\\
b\equiv 10\pmod {16}\implies t_b\equiv 6\pmod 7\\
c\equiv 15\pmod {16}\implies t_c\equiv 1\pmod 7
\end{cases}~.\]Thus, $$t_a+t_b+t_c\equiv 5+6+1\equiv 12\equiv \boxed{5}\pmod 7.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we observe that the only pairs of integers from 1 to 6 that fail to be relatively prime are any pair of even integers as well as the pair (3, 6). If we temporarily ignore the pair (3, 6), we can focus only on parity. We must arrange the six digits in such a way that no two even digits are consecutive. Using $\color{blue}e$ to denote even and $o$ to denote odd, this gives us four different possible arrangements:

\begin{align}
{\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e} o \\
o {\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e} \\
{\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e} o o {\color{blue}e} \\
{\color{blue}e} o o {\color{blue}e} o {\color{blue}e
}\end{align}For any of these four arrangements, there are $3!$ ways to select the three even numbers and $3!$ ways to select the three odd numbers, for a total of $3! \cdot 3! = 36$ total arrangements. Hence, ignoring the issue of (3, 6) adjacencies, we have $36 \cdot 4 = 144$ such numbers.

Now, we must count the number of the above arrangements that include any (3, 6) adjacencies and subtract them off. Let's consider the number of (3, 6) adjacencies in arrangement $(1)$. Suppose that the first digit is 6. Then if the second digit is 3, there are $2! \cdot 2! = 4$ arrangements of the remaining digits. So there are 4 arrangements that go 6 3 \_ \_ \_ \_. If instead the third digit is 6, then by similar reasoning, there are 4 arrangements that go \_ 3 6 \_ \_ \_, and 4 arrangements that go \_ \_ 6 3 \_ \_, for a total of 8 arrangements. By symmetry, there are also 8 arrangements that include a (3, 6) adjacency when the fifth digit is 6. So, there are a total of $4 + 8 + 8 = 20$ arrangements of $(1)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. By symmetry, there are also $20$ arrangements of $(2)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent.

Finally, we must count the number of arrangements of $(3)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. From previous reasoning, we see that if the 6 is on an endpoint, there are 4 arrangements with an adjacent 3, and if 6 is in the interior, there are 8 such arrangements. Hence, in this case, there are $4 + 8 + 4 = 16$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent. Again, by symmetry, there are also $16$ arrangements of $(4)$ with 3 and 6 adjacent.

Overall, there are $20 + 20 + 16 + 16 = 72$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent. So, our final answer is $144 - 72 = \boxed{72}$ numbers.

Extracting Answer from: 
If a number is divisible by 450, then it must be divisible by all divisors of 450, including 9 and 50.

For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since a positive number must have at least one digit which is not 0, the number we're looking for is forced to have at least 9 ones among its digits.

The number we're looking for must also be divisible by 50, which means that it ends in 50 or 00. Since the digit 5 is not allowed, our number must end in 00, which means the smallest candidate is  $\boxed{11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100}$. In fact, because 9 and 50 $\emph{do}$ divide this number, and because 450 is the least common multiple of 9 and 50, we know that 450 does divide 11,111,111,100; so that number is the correct answer.

Note that $27$ and $40$ are relatively prime, so $27$ has an inverse $\pmod{40}$. Conveniently, the inverse of $27\pmod{40}$ is easily found to be $3$, as we have $27\cdot 3 = 81\equiv 1\pmod{40}$.

To solve the congruence $27a\equiv 17\pmod{40}$, we multiply both sides by $3$ and simplify: \begin{align*}
3\cdot 27a &\equiv 3\cdot 17 \pmod{40} \\
a &\equiv 51 \pmod{40} \\
a &\equiv 11 \pmod{40}
\end{align*}Each operation in this sequence is reversible, so the solution set is exactly the set of integers congruent to $11\pmod{40}$. The smallest and second-smallest positive solutions are $11$ and $51$. Their sum is $\boxed{62}$.

First, we find $A$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $2^2 \cdot 5^3$. Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.

Now we prime factorize $7 \cdot 156 = 7 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\boxed{25}$.

We start off by replacing $C$ with $A+B$ and changing the form of the two-digit integer in the second equation. \begin{align*}

11A-B&=2A+2B\quad\Rightarrow\\
9A&=3B\quad\Rightarrow\\

\end{align*}Now we replace $C$, change the two-digit integer, and then substitute $B$ with $3A$ in the third equation. \begin{align*}
(A+B)\times B&=10A+A+A\quad\Rightarrow\\
&=12A\quad\Rightarrow\\
(A+3A)\times3A&=12A\quad\Rightarrow\\
(4A)\times3A&=12A\quad\Rightarrow\\
12(A)^2&=12A
\end{align*}For $(A)^2$ to equal $A$, $A$ must equal 1. Since $3A=B$, $B=3$. That means $A+B=C=4$. So the sum of the three digits is $1+3+4=\boxed{8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Obviously, we have that $k > 3$, because otherwise two of the integers would be identical and not be relatively prime. Start by testing $k=4$. $6n+4$ and $6n+3$ are relatively prime because they are consecutive integers, but $6n+4$ and $6n+2$ are both even and are therefore not relatively prime. The next candidate to test is $k=5$. Firstly, we have that
\begin{align*}
\gcd(6n+5, 6n+3) &= \gcd(6n+3, (6n+5)-(6n+3)) \\ &= \gcd(6n+3, 2). 
\end{align*}Since $6n+3$ is always odd, the two integers $6n+5$ and $6n+3$ are relatively prime.
Secondly,
\begin{align*}
\gcd(6n+5, 6n+2) &= \gcd(6n+2, (6n+5)-(6n+2)) \\&= \gcd(6n+2, 3). 
\end{align*}Note that $6n+3$ is always divisible by 3, so $6n+2$ is never divisible by 3. As a result, we have that $6n+5$ and $6n+2$ are relatively prime. Finally,
\begin{align*}
\gcd(6n+5, 6n+1) &= \gcd(6n+1, (6n+5)-(6n+1)) \\ &= \gcd(6n+1, 4). 
\end{align*}Note that $6n+1$ is always odd, so $6n+5$ and $6n+1$ are also relatively prime. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ that permits $6n+k$ to be relatively prime with each of $6n+3$, $6n+2$, and $6n+1$ is $k = \boxed{5}$.

The first possibility we have is that $A$ and $B$ are both equal to 0, in which case the addition problem would simplify to $0+0=0$. However, since the problem states that both $A$ and $B$ are positive integers, we can eliminate this possibility. Therefore we can assume that there is carrying in the right column, giving us $A_9+B_9=10_9$ or that $A+B=9$. Since we know that there is a 1 carried over, the left column tell us that $1+A=B$. Solving this system of equations, we find that $A=4$ and $B=5$. Thus, $A\cdot B=4\cdot5=\boxed{20}$.

The product of the (positive and negative) divisors of an integer $a$ is negative if $a$ has an odd number of negative divisors. It follows that $-a$ must have an odd number of positive divisors. However, for every positive divisor $d$ of $-a$, then $(-a)/d$ is also a positive divisor of $-a$, so that the positive divisors of $-a$ can be paired up. The exception is if $-a$ is a perfect square, in which case $\sqrt{-a}$ will not be paired up with another divisor.

We have $$729_{16} = 7\cdot 16^2 + 2\cdot 16 + 9.$$ We could actually convert this to base 10 and divide by $15$, but we can also use a clever trick here, writing $16$ as $15+1$ and $16^2$ as $15\cdot 17+1$. Then \begin{align*}
729_{16} &= 7(15\cdot 17+1) + 2(15+1) + 9 \\
&= 15(7\cdot 17+2) + (7+2+9) \\
&= (\text{a multiple of 15}) + 18,
\end{align*} so when we divide by $15$, the remainder is the same as the remainder left by $18$. This is $\boxed{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We start by computing the sum of the units digits of all multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$. Excluding $0$, every possible digit appears exactly once as a unit digit of a multiple of $3$: the set of multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $30$ consists of the numbers $0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30$. Thus, the sum of their units digits is equal to $$1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 45.$$ We must sum the units digits of the multiples of $3$ between $31$ and $50$. The relevant multiples of $3$ are  $33,36,39,42,45,48$, and the sum of their units digits is $3+6+9+2+5+8 = 33$. Thus, the answer is $45 + 33 = \boxed{78}$.

To find the smallest reversible prime greater than 17, we first consider the two-digit primes greater than 17. 19 is prime, but $91=7\times13$ is not.

We skip all of the two-digit primes whose tens digit is 2 since the number formed by reversing the digits will be even and hence not prime.

Next try the prime 31, and since 13 is prime as well, the smallest reversible prime greater than 17 is $\boxed{31}$.

We first recognize that $132=11\times 12$, so its prime factorization is $132 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 11$. We only need to see if these three prime factors will divide into $6432$. Indeed, $6432$ will satisfy the divisibility properties for both $3$ and $4$, and we can long divide to see that $11$ does not divide into $6432$. Thus, the greatest common factor is $3 \times 4 = 12$. The greatest common factor increased by 11 is $12+11 = \boxed{23}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The positive integers with exactly four positive divisors are the integers of the form $p^3$, where $p$ is a prime, or $p \cdot q$, where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. We consider each case:

Suppose that $m = p^3$ for some prime $p$. Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + p^2 + p^3.$ For $p = 11,$ this value of $m$ is too low, and for $p = 13,$ the value of $m$ is too high; therefore, no prime $p$ gives a value of $n$ in the given set.

Therefore, we must have $m = p \cdot q$, for some distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ Then the sum of the divisors of $m$ is $1 + p + q + pq$, which we can factor as $(1+p)(1+q)$. First suppose that one of $p$ and $q$ equals $2$; without loss of generality, let $p = 2$. Then $(1+p)(1+q) = 3(1+q).$ Since $q \neq p = 2$, we see that $q$ is odd, and so $1+q$ is even. Thus $3(1+q)$ is divisible by $6,$ so it must be either $2010$ or $2016.$ Trying both cases, we see that both $3(1+q) = 2010$ and $3(1 + q) = 2016$ give a non-prime value of $q.$

If neither $p$ nor $q$ equals $2$, then both are odd primes, so $(1+p)(1+q)$ is the product of two even numbers, which must be divisible by $4.$ The only multiples of $4$ in the given range are $2012$ and $2016$.  We have $2012 = 2^2 \cdot 503,$ so the only way to write $2012$ as the product of two even positive integers is $2012 = 2 \cdot 1006.$ But we cannot have $1+p=2$ or $1+q=2$, since $2-1=1$ is not prime.  Note that $2016 = (1 + 3)(1 + 503).$  Since both 3 and 503 are prime, 2016 is nice.

Thus, $\boxed{2016}$ is the only nice number in the given set.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by multiplying both sides of the congruence by $10$ and evaluating both sides modulo $997$: \begin{align*}
10\cdot 100x &\equiv 10\cdot 1 \pmod{997} \\
1000x &\equiv 10 \pmod{997} \\
3x &\equiv 10 \pmod{997}
\end{align*}

Why multiply by $10$? Well, as the computations above show, the result is to produce a congruence equivalent to the original congruence, but with a much smaller coefficient for $x$.

From here, we could repeat the same strategy a couple more times; for example, multiplying both sides by $333$ would give $999x\equiv 2x$ on the left side, reducing the coefficient of $x$ further. One more such step would reduce the coefficient of $x$ to $1$, giving us the solution.

However, there is an alternative way of solving $3x\equiv 10\pmod{997}$. We note that we can rewrite this congruence as $3x\equiv -987\pmod{997}$ (since $10\equiv -987\pmod{997}$). Then $-987$ is a multiple of $3$: specifically, $-987 = 3\cdot (-329)$, so multiplying both sides by $3^{-1}$ gives $$x \equiv -329\pmod{997}.$$ This is the solution set to the original congruence. The unique three-digit positive solution is $$x = -329 + 997 = \boxed{668}.$$

Looking at our sum, we can see that the numbers $1$ through $8$ can be paired off to form $9,$ so we may eliminate them. That is, $1 + 8 = 2 + 7 = 3 + 6 = 4 + 5 = 9.$ Therefore, the only remaining terms are $9$ and $10,$ and $9$ is obviously also divisible by $9,$ hence we only need to find the remainder of $10$ when divided by $9,$ which is $\boxed{1}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we know that $x$ is even. Every prime number larger than $3$ is odd, so the sum of three members has to be even.

Now, $12$ does not work because $(2+10+12)+1=25$, which is not prime.

Similarly, $14$ does not work because $(2+4+14)+1=21$, which is not prime.

But $16$ works because all the possible sums involving $x=16$ generate prime results: $(2+4+16)+1=23$, $(2+10+16)+1=29$, and $(4+10+16)+1=31$.

So the smallest possible value of $x$ is $\boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we observe that both $4$ and $25$ will divide into the least common multiple. Thus, $100$ will divide into the least common multiple, and so $C = 0$.

Also, we notice that $9$ and $11$ divide into the least common multiple. Thus, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$: $$2 + 6 + A + 7 + 1 + 1 + 4 + B + 4 = 25 + A + B = 27,36$$and the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by $11$ (the divisibility rule for $11$): $$2 - 6 + A - 7 + 1 - 1 + 4 - B + 4 = -3 + A - B = 0, -11.$$It follows that $A+B = 2,11$ and $A - B = 3, -8$. Summing the two equations yields that $2A \in \{-6,3,5,14\}$, of which only $2A = 14 \Longrightarrow A = 7$ works. It follows that $B = 4$, and the answer is $\boxed{740}$.

To express 87 in base 2, first note that $2^6=64$ is the largest power of 2 which is less than 87. Therefore, the first non-zero digit goes in the 7th place to the left of the decimal point. Since $2^4=16$ is the highest power of 2 less than $87-64=23$, the next non-zero digit goes in the 5th place to the left of the decimal point.  Continuing this process, we find $87 = 2^6 + 2^4 + 2^2 +2^1 + 2^0$, so $87_{10}=1010111_2$.  Similarly, we find $87=3^4+2\cdot 3^1$ so $87_{10}=10020_3$.  The difference between 7 digits and 5 digits is $\boxed{2}$ digits.

Let $d = \gcd(n + 5, n + 11)$, so $d$ divides both $n + 5$ and $n + 11$.  Then $d$ divides $(n + 11) - (n + 5) = 6$.  Therefore, $d$ can only be 1, 2, 3, or 6.

If $n = 2$, then $\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \gcd(7,13) = 1$.

If $n = 3$, then $\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \gcd(8,14) = 2$.

If $n = 4$, then $\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \gcd(9,15) = 3$.

If $n = 1$, then $\gcd(n + 5, n + 11) = \gcd(6,12) = 6$.

If $m\equiv 6\pmod 9$, then we can write $m$ as $9a+6$ for some integer $a$. This is equal to $3(3a+2)$, so $m$ is certainly divisible by $3$.  If $n\equiv 0\pmod 9$, then $n$ is divisible by $9$. Therefore, $mn$ must be divisible by $3\cdot 9 = 27$.

Note that $m$ can be 6 and $n$ can be 9, which gives us $mn = 54$.  Also, $m$ can be 15 and $n$ can be 9, which gives us $mn = 135$.  The gcd of 54 and 135 is 27.

Therefore, the largest integer that $mn$ must be divisible by is $\boxed{27}$.

Both $a$ and $b$ must be divisible by $6$, so the choices for $a$ are $$12, 42, 72, 102, 132, \ldots\phantom{~.}$$and the choices for $b$ are $$24, 54, 84, 114, 144, \ldots~.$$We know that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$ (since this identity holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$). Therefore, $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = \frac{ab}{6},$$so in order to minimize $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$, we should make $ab$ as small as possible. But we can't take $a=12$ and $b=24$, because then $\gcd(a,b)$ would be $12$, not $6$. The next best choice is either $a=12,b=54$ or $a=42,b=24$. Either of these pairs yields $\gcd(a,b)=6$ as desired, but the first choice, $a=12$ and $b=54$, yields a smaller product. Hence this is the optimal choice, and the smallest possible value for $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[12,54] = \frac{12\cdot 54}{6} = 2\cdot 54 = \boxed{108}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We can rewrite $0.1\overline{23}$ as $0.1$ + $0.0\overline{23}$. The first decimal is simply $\frac{1}{10}$. Let the second decimal be $x$. Multiplying by 100, we have $100x = 2.3\overline{23}$, which gives $99x = 2.3 \implies x = \frac{23}{990}$. Therefore, $0.1\overline{23} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{23}{990} = \frac{61}{495}$. Thus $a+b=61+495 = \boxed{556}$.

From the addition problem, we know that in the units digit, it's impossible to have $B+A=0_7$, so it must be that $B+A=10_7=7$. That means we carry a 1 to the next column and get $A+B+1=AA_7$. Since $B+A=10_7$, then $A+B+1=11_7$ and $A$ represents the digit 1. That tells us that $B+1=7$, so $B$ represents the digit 6. The product of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{6}$.

Written  as a product of primes, we have \[

\]A cube that is a factor has a prime factorization of the form $2^p\cdot 3^q\cdot 5^r\cdot 7^s$, where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are all multiples of 3. There are 3 possible values for $p$, which are  0, 3, and 6. There are 2 possible values for $q$, which are $0$ and $3$. The only value  for $r$ and for $s$ is 0.

Extracting Answer from: 
We want to find the residue $c$ such that $35c \equiv 1 \pmod{47}$. Recall that, since 35 is relatively prime to 47, this inverse exists and is unique. To make use of the table we are given, we notice that $35 = 5\cdot 7$. We can multiply both sides of $35c \equiv 1\pmod{47}$ by the inverse of 5 to obtain  \begin{align*}
19\cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot c &\equiv 19\cdot 1 \pmod{47} \implies \\
(19\cdot 5) \cdot 7 \cdot c &\equiv 19 \pmod{47} \implies \\
1 \cdot 7 \cdot c &\equiv 19 \pmod{47}. \\
\end{align*}Now we can multiply both sides by 27, the inverse of 7, to find  \begin{align*}
27\cdot 7 \cdot c &\equiv 27\cdot 19 \pmod{47} \implies \\
c &\equiv 513 \pmod{47}.
\end{align*}Subtracting 470 from 513 does not change its residue (mod 47), so we have $c\equiv 43\pmod{47}$. Since $0\leq 43 < 47$, $\boxed{43}$ is the desired residue.

Remark: More generally, the approach above shows that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$, where $b^{-1}$ denotes the modular inverse of $b$.

Define the sequence $$x_i = \text{the remainder when }2^i\text{ is divided by 100}.$$  Then note that $x_{22} = x_2 = 4$, and thus this sequence repeats every 20 terms from $x_2$ onward.  The desired product is $2^{1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 99 + 100} = 2^{5050}$.  If we can find $x_{5050}$, we will then be done.  But since $5050 = 20\cdot 252 + 10$, we see that $x_{5050} = x_{10} = 24$.  Thus our answer is $2\cdot 4 = \boxed{8}$.

First we find the prime factorization of 288 to be $2^5\cdot 3^2$, and we have to split these factors among two consecutive even integers. The 3 must be with at least one 2 for the integer to be even, meaning one of the factors must be a multiple of $6.$ After some playing around, we find that when one factor is 18, that leaves us with $2^4=16$.

We first look at the hundreds place. Since $E\ne G$, it must be that $E+1=G$ in order to get $G$ in the hundreds place. Since a $1$ is carried over, we have $G+G=10+M$. Now we look at the units place. Either $M+M=M$ or $M+M=10+M$. In the second case, $2M=10+M\qquad\Rightarrow M=10$, which is not a possible digit. So it must be that $2M=M$, which is only possible if $M=0$. Now $2G=10\qquad\Rightarrow G=5$ and $E+1=G\qquad\Rightarrow E=4$. The numerical value of $E$ is $\boxed{4}$. We can check that $450+50=500$, which matches the digits in the addition problem.

We can consider both $n$ and $k$ as multiples of their greatest common divisor: \begin{align*}
n &= n'\cdot\gcd(n,k), \\
k &= k'\cdot\gcd(n,k),
\end{align*}where $n'$ and $k'$ are relatively prime integers. Then $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,k] = \frac{n\cdot k}{\gcd(n,k)} = n'\cdot k'\cdot\gcd(n,k)$, so $$\frac{\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\gcd(n,k)} = n'k'.$$We have $\frac{n'}{k'} = \frac nk$. So, we wish to minimize $n'k'$ under the constraint that $5<\frac{n'}{k'}<6$. That is, we wish to find the smallest possible product of the numerator and denominator of a fraction whose value is between 5 and 6. Clearly the denominator $k'$ is at least $2$, and the numerator $n'$ is at least $5(2)+1=11$, so the smallest possible value for $n'k'$ is $(11)(2)=\boxed{22}$.

Note that this result, $\frac{\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n,k]}{\gcd(n,k)}=22$, can be achieved by the example $n=11,k=2$.

Under 10,000, there are 5,000 numbers divisible by 2, 2,000 numbers divisible by 5, and 1,000 numbers divisible by 10. (Every other number is divisible by 2, so $\frac{10,\!000}{2}$ is the number of multiples of 2 less than or equal to 10,000, every fifth number is divisible by 5, so $\frac{10,\!000}{5}$ is the number of multiples of 5 less than or equal to 10,000, and so on.)  If something is divisible by 10, then it is divisible by both 2 and 5, we need only count the number of distinct multiples of 2 and 5.  There are 5,000 multiples of 2, and 2,000 multiples of 5, so adding them up, we get 7,000, and then we must subtract those of which we overcounted, which happen to be the multiples of 10, so subtracting 1,000, we get $\boxed{6,\!000}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \cdot 10$ palindromes.

Next, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.

Now we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$

Therefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$

Since there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\frac{10}{90}=\boxed{\frac19}$.

We are interested in the remainders when prime numbers are divided by 7. The first ten primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The remainders when these prime are divided by 7 are 2, 3, 5, 0, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, respectively. Starting with the first triple, add the remainders to see whether the sum is a multiple of 7, in which case the corresponding prime numbers have a sum that is a multiple of 7. We see that $6+3+5=14$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Use the Euclidean algorithm on $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. \begin{align*}
h(x) &= \gcd(f(x), g(x)) \\
&= \gcd(12x+7, 5x+2) \\
&= \gcd(5x+2, (12x+7)-2(5x+2)) \\
&= \gcd(5x+2, 2x + 3) \\
&= \gcd(2x+3, (5x+2)-2(2x+3)) \\
&= \gcd(2x+3, x - 4) \\
&= \gcd(x-4, (2x+3)-2(x-4)) \\
&= \gcd(x-4, 11)
\end{align*}From applying the Euclidean algorithm, we have that the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is 11 if and only if $x-4$ is a multiple of 11. For example, note that $f(4) = 55$ and $g(4) = 22$, and the greatest common divisor of 55 and 22 turns out to be 11. If $x-4$ is not a multiple of 11, then the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be one, since 11 is prime and therefore has no other factors.

We must find the least prime number, $p$, such that $p=25n+2$ for some positive integer $n$. It is clear that $n$ must be odd because otherwise $p$ is divisible by 2 and hence not prime. $n=1$ gives $p=27$, which is composite. $n=3$ gives $p=77$, which is composite. But $n=5$ gives $p=127$, which is prime. Thus, $\boxed{127}$ is the least prime number greater than 25 that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 25.

The divisors of 300 can be split into $d/2$ pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 300: $\{1,300\}, \{2,150\},$ etc. Thus $A=300^{d/2}$, which implies that $A$ has the same prime divisors as 300. Since the prime factorization of $300$ is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$, the sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+5=\boxed{10}$.

We can factor $\frac{1}{x^2+x} = \frac{1}{x(x+1)}$. Therefore, we want both $x$ and $x+1$ to be divisible by 2 and 5. They cannot both be even, so we have that either $x$ or $x+1$ is odd, so either $x$ or $x+1$ is a power of 5. We start by considering the power $5^0 = 1$. If $x=1$, we have the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$, which terminates. If $x+1=1$, we get $x=0$, but then we have an invalid fraction. We now consider the power $5^1 = 5$. If $x=5$, we have the fraction $\frac{1}{30}$, which repeats due to the factor of 3 in the denominator. If $x+1 = 5$, then $x=4$, so the fraction is $\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$. The second smallest integer $x$ such that $\frac{1}{x^2+x}$ is a terminating decimal is $x = \boxed{4}$.

Note that $S_{n+1}-S_n = 2^n$. Also note that $S_n$ is a geometric series with a sum equal to $2^0\cdot\frac{1-2^n}{1-2} = 2^n-1$. Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we obtain: \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(S_{n+1}, S_n) &= \text{gcd}(S_{n+1}-S_n, S_n) \\
&= \text{gcd}(2^n, 2^n-1) \\
&= \text{gcd}(2^n - (2^n-1), 2^n-1) \\
&= \text{gcd}(1, 2^n-1) \\
&= 1.
\end{align*}Therefore, the greatest common divisor of two consecutive terms is always $1$, so the largest possible value is $\boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In the subtraction problem, we can start by looking at the left column. The first possible case is that $A-B=0$, so that $A=B$. However, if $A=B$, that does not work in the right column, since $B-A$ would equal 0 and not 3. So, we have to go with the second possibility for the left column, in which the right column borrowed from the left column and we're left with $(A-1)-B=0$. This tells us that $A-1=B$, so the nonnegative difference of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{1}$.

Note that we are unable to solve for the actual digits $A$ and $B$ even if we consider the units digit. Now that we know the right column borrows from the left column, we get that $$ \begin{array}{c@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & & 1 & B_4\\ &- & & & & A_4\\ \cline{2-6} & & & & & 3_4.\\ \end{array} $$This also means $A+3=1B_4=4+B$, which is the same as $A-1=B$. We can't solve for $A$ and $B$ because any digits that satisfy $A-1=B$ will work, such as $A=3, B=2$ or $A=2, B=1$.

First we change everything to base 10: \begin{align*}
16A+4B+C+200&=81A+9B+C\quad\Rightarrow\\
200&=65A+5B.
\end{align*}Notice that the $C$ cancels out on both sides, so $C$ could be any valid digit that works in both base 4 and 9 (0, 1, 2, 3). Now we maximize $A$ with $A=3$ and solve $200=65(3)+5B$ to get $B=1$. If we take any smaller value for $A$, then $B$ will be too large to be a digit. So there is only one value of $A$, one value of $B$, and four possible values for $C$. The sum is $3+1+0+1+2+3=\boxed{10}$.

Answer: 2

Solution: if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, the entire number is divisible by 3. Since 1, 2, 4, and 6 are all the digits that sum to 13, which is not a multiple of 3, none of these digits can be a factor. However, since 3 divides into 1, 2, and 6, and its sum, 12, is a multiple of 3, the digit 3 itself is a factor. We see that 1452 is divisible by 12, so it is also divisible by 4, and so it is also divisible by 2. Thus, 2 is also a factor of 1452.

We see that $8^4=4096$ is the largest power of 8 less than 8888, and that it can go into the given number 2 times, leaving us with $8888-(2)(4096)=696$. The next largest power of 8, $8^3=512$, can only go into 696 once, giving us the remainder $696-512=184$. Since the largest multiple of $8^2=64$ less than 184 is $2\cdot64=128$, we are then left with $184-128=56$. $8^1=8$ goes into 56 exactly 7 times, leaving us with a remainder of $56-56=0$ and subsequently a coefficient of 0 for the $8^0$ term. So $8888_{10}=2\cdot8^4+1\cdot8^3+2\cdot8^2+7\cdot{8^1}+0\cdot8^0=21270_8$, and the sum of the digits is $2+1+2+7+0=\boxed{12}$.

We find that $p(n+1) = (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 41 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n^2 + n + 41$. By the Euclidean algorithm, \begin{align*} &\text{gcd}\,(p(n+1),p(n)) \\
&\qquad = \text{gcd}\,(n^2+n+41,n^2 - n+41) \\
&\qquad = \text{gcd}\,(n^2 + n + 41 - (n^2 - n + 41), n^2 - n + 41) \\
&\qquad = \text{gcd}\,(2n,n^2-n+41). \end{align*}Since $n^2$ and $n$ have the same parity (that is, they will both be even or both be odd), it follows that $n^2 - n + 41$ is odd. Thus, it suffices to evaluate $\text{gcd}\,(n,n^2 - n + 41) = \text{gcd}\,(n,n^2-n+41 - n(n-1)) = \text{gcd}\,(n,41)$. The smallest desired positive integer is then $n = \boxed{41}$.

In fact, for all integers $n$ from $1$ through $40$, it turns out that $p(n)$ is a prime number.

The identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$ holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.

Let $a=315$ in this identity, and let $b$ be the number we're looking for. Thus $$7!\cdot 9 = 315\cdot b,$$so $$b = \frac{7!\cdot 9}{315} = \frac{7!\cdot 9}{35\cdot 9} = \frac{7!}{35} = \frac{\cancel{7}\cdot 6\cdot \cancel{5}\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{\cancel{35}} = 6\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2 = \boxed{144}.$$

Since $18=2\cdot 3^2$, an integer is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.  For $k3,\!57k$ to be divisible by 2, $k$ must be even.  To determine whether $k3,\!57k$ is divisible by 9, we find the sum of its digits, which is $2k+15$.  Substituting $k=0,2,4,\ldots$, we find that none of the numbers 15, 19, or 23 are divisible by 9, but $15+2(6)=27$ is divisible by 9.  Therefore, $k=\boxed{6}$.

Recall the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Applying this identity to $12$ and $t$, we obtain $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[12,t]\cdot \gcd(12,t) = 12t,$$and so (cubing both sides) $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[12,t]^3 \cdot \gcd(12,t)^3 = (12t)^3.$$Substituting $(12t)^2$ for $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[12,t]^3$ and dividing both sides by $(12t)^2$, we have $$\gcd(12,t)^3 = 12t,$$so in particular, $12t$ is the cube of an integer. Since $12=2^2\cdot 3^1$, the smallest cube of the form $12t$ is $2^3\cdot 3^3$, which is obtained when $t=2^1\cdot 3^2 = 18$. This tells us that $t\ge 18$.

We must check whether $t$ can be $18$. That is, we must check whether $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[12,18]^3=(12\cdot 18)^2$. In fact, this equality does hold (both sides are equal to $6^6$), so the smallest possible value of $t$ is confirmed to be $\boxed{18}$.

One gear turns $33\frac{1}{3}=100/3$ times in 60 seconds, so it turns 5/9 times in one second, or 5 times in 9 seconds. The other gear turns 45 times in 60 seconds, so it turns 3/4 times in one second, or 3 times in 4 seconds. To find out after how many seconds the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north, we have to find the least common multiple of $4=2^2$ and $9=3^2$, which is $2^2\cdot3^2=36$. Therefore, the two gears next have both their marks pointing due north after $\boxed{36}$ seconds. (One gear turns exactly $5\times4=20$ times, and the other gear turns exactly $3\times9=27$ times.)

The prime factorization of 252 is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7^1$. The number of factors of 252 is $(2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 18$. Since any divisor of 252 that contains no $2$โs will be odd and any divisor of 252 that contains one or more $2$โs will be even, we count the number of odd divisors and subtract from $18$. The number of odd divisors is the number of divisors of $3^2 \cdot 7^1$, which is $(2+1)(1+1)=6$. Thus there are $18-6=\boxed{12}$ even divisors of 252.

$\underline{\text{Solution}}:$ We simplify the given system of equations as follows \begin{align*}
&x-1\equiv 1-x\pmod {12} \implies 2x\equiv 2 \pmod {12} \implies x\equiv 1 \pmod {6},\\
&x-2\equiv 2-x\pmod{12} \implies 2x\equiv 4 \pmod {12} \implies x\equiv 2\pmod {6}.
\end{align*} Therefore, $x\equiv 1, 7 \pmod {12}$ are the only possible solutions. Since $0\le x< 12$, so we have $x=1, 7$ are two possible solutions. Hence, the number of integers $x$ such that $0\le x< 12$ that satisfies the given system of equations is $\boxed{2}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Divisibility by 4 depends only on the last two digits, since 100 is divisible by 4.  Therefore, to form the largest possible multiple of 4, we must use the smallest pair of digits which form a multiple of 4 as the last two digits and place the remaining digits in descending order in the first four positions.  Neither 43 nor 34 is a multiple of 4, but the next smallest pair of digits does form a multiple of 4, namely 36.  Therefore, the smallest multiple of 4 using the given digits is $\boxed{987,\!436}$.

Here we can use the divisibility rule for 7: drop the last digit, subtract twice its value from the number formed from the remaining digits, and check if the result is divisible by 7. (This rule isn't often used since it's not nearly as simple as the other divisibility rules, but it can still be useful!) To see how this works for the number $\underline{2d2}$, the rule says drop the last digit (2), leaving the number $\underline{2d}$; subtracting twice the last digit gives $\underline{2d} - 4$. This needs to be divisible by 7, but the only multiple of 7 between $20-4=16$ and $29-4=25$ is 21, so we must have $d=\boxed{5}$ since $25 - 4 = 21$.

The inverse of $5\pmod{7}$ is 3, since $5\cdot3 \equiv 1\pmod{7}$. Also, inverse of $2\pmod{7}$ is 4, since $2\cdot 4\equiv 1\pmod{7}$.

2. We can then try to solve for $x$ using the fact that $ax\equiv1$ and $bx\equiv1$ (mod $m$) because $a^{-1}$ and $b^{-1}$ exist.
3. We have $2^{-1}\equiv4$ (mod $7$) and $3^{-1}\equiv5$ (mod $7$).

Call Jan's number $J$. $12 = 2^2 \cdot 3$ and $15 = 3 \cdot 5$, so $J$ has at least two factors of 2, one factor of 3, and one factor of 5 in its prime factorization. If $J$ has exactly two factors of 2, then the prime factorization of $J$ is of the form $2^2 \cdot 3^a \cdot 5^b \cdots$. Counting the number of positive factors of this yields $(2+1)(a+1)(b+1)\cdots = 3k$, where $k$ is some integer. But we know $J$ has 16 factors, and since 16 is not divisible by 3, $16 \neq 3k$ for any integer $k$. So $J$ cannot have exactly two factors of 2, so it must have at least 3. This means that $J$ is divisible by $2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 120$. But 120 already has $(3+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ factors, so $J$ must be $\boxed{120}$ (or else $J$ would have more than 16 factors).

3523 &\equiv 23 \pmod{100},\\
3737 &\equiv 37 \pmod{100},\\

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the base $5$ representation of $123_{10}$, we first write $123$ as the sum of powers of $5$. The largest power of $5$ that is less than $123$ is $5^2 = 25$ and the largest multiple of $25$ that is less than $123$ is $4 \cdot 25 = 100$. Thus, we have $123 = 4 \cdot 25 + 23$. We then consider the largest power of $5$ that is less than $23$ which is $5^1 = 5$. The largest multiple of $5$ that is less than $23$ is $4 \cdot 5 = 20$ and we have $23 - 20 = 3$, which can be written as $3 \cdot 5^0$. Therefore, we can write $123$ as $$123 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 4 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0.$$Thus, $123_{10}$ in base $5$ is $\boxed{443_5}$.

First notice that $a\equiv 8\pmod 9$ tells us that $a\equiv 2\pmod 3$, so once we satisfy the former, we have the latter.    So, we focus on the final three congruences.  We do so by rewriting them as \begin{align*}
a&\equiv -1\pmod 5,\\
a&\equiv -1\pmod 7,\\
a&\equiv -1\pmod 9.
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(5,7)=\gcd(7,9)=\gcd(9,5)=1$, the above congruences apply that $a\equiv -1\pmod{5\cdot 7\cdot 9}$, or $a\equiv 314\pmod{315}$. So $a$ is of the form $314+315n$ for an integer $n$. The smallest non-negative number of this form is $\boxed{314}$, which satisfies the original congruences.

Let the integers be $a$ and $b$. Then $ab = 144$ and $$\frac{\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]}{\gcd(a,b)} = 9.$$The identity $ab = \gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ yields that $$ab = \gcd(a,b) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 144.$$Multiplying the two equations above yields that $\big(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\big)^2 = 9 \cdot 144 = 36^2$, so $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] = 36$.  Then $\gcd(a,b) = 144/36 = 4$.

Since $\gcd(a,b) = 4$ is a divisor of both $a$ and $b$, $a$ must have at least two factors of 2, and $b$ must have at least two factors of 2.  Therefore, their product $ab$ has at least four factors of 2.  But $ab = 144 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2$, which has exactly four factors of 2, so both $a$ and $b$ have exactly two factors of 2.

Since $ab = 2^4 \cdot 3^2$, the only primes that can divide $a$ and $b$ are 2 and 3.  Let $a = 2^2 \cdot 3^u$ and let $b = 2^2 \cdot 3^v$.  Then $\gcd(a,b) = 2^2 \cdot 3^{\min\{u,v\}}$.  But $\gcd(a,b) = 4 = 2^2 \cdot 3^0$, so $\min\{u,v\} = 0$, which means that either $u = 0$ or $v = 0$.

Hence, one of the numbers $a$ and $b$ must be 4, and the other number must be $144/4 = 36$.  Therefore, the sum of the numbers is $4 + 36 = \boxed{40}$.

{"operand_1": 12, "operand_2": 12, "operator": "/", "operand_3": 1, "operand_4": 9}

Since the ratio of the least common multiple by the greatest common divisor is equal to 9:
If the greatest common divisor of these two numbers is x:
- The least common multiple of the two numbers is: 9x
- As the product of the two numbers is 144, then the two numbers can be written as: x(a * b) = 144
- We can then say that the least common multiple of the two numbers is: (ab)/x * 144
Then: (ab/x * 144)/x = 9
From this last equation we can get that x = 4 and since the product of the two numbers is 144,
then a + b = 36. Thus the sum of the two integers is 36.

Note that $400 = 4 \cdot 10^2 = 2^2 \cdot 10^2 = 2^4 \cdot 5^2$. Therefore, $\frac{141}{400} = \frac{141}{2^4 \cdot 5^2}$. If we multiply this fraction by $10^4$, we shift all digits $4$ places to the left, so $\frac{141}{2^4 \cdot 5^2} \cdot 10^4 = 141 \cdot 5^2 = 3525$. The last nonzero digit is therefore $\boxed{5}$.

Since the GCD of $m$ and $n$ is 8, $m = 8x$ and $n = 8y$ for some integers $x$ and $y$.  Note that minimizing $m + n = 8x + 8y = 8(x + y)$ is equivalent to minimizing $x + y$.

The LCM of $m$ and $n$ is $112 = 2^4 \cdot 7 = 8 \cdot 2 \cdot 7$, so one of $x$ and $y$ is divisible by 2 and one is divisible by 7.  Then we can minimize $x + y$ by setting $x$ and $y$ to be 2 and 7 in some order.  Therefore, the least possible value of $m+n$ is $8(2 + 7) = \boxed{72}$.

The units digit of $17^3 - 17$ is the same as the units digit as $7^{13} - 7$.  To find the units digit of $7^{13}$, we look at the first few powers of 7 modulo 10: \begin{align*}
7^0 &\equiv 1, \\
7^1 &\equiv 7, \\
7^2 &\equiv 7 \cdot 7 \equiv 49 \equiv 9, \\
7^3 &\equiv 7 \cdot 9 \equiv 63 \equiv 3, \\
7^4 &\equiv 7 \cdot 3 \equiv 21 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}.
\end{align*}

Since $7^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$, the remainders become periodic, with period 4.  Since $13 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$, $7^{13} \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$, so the units digit of $7^{13} - 7$ is $\boxed{0}$.

If an integer has at least two different prime factors, say, $p$ and $q$, then it must have at least four positive divisors: $1$, $p$, $q$, and $pq$. So, for a number to have exactly three positive divisors, it must be a power of a single prime number. The positive divisors of $p^n$ are $1,p,p^2,p^3,\cdots,p^{n-1},p^n$. Therefore, $p^n$ has $n+1$ different positive divisors, and the only positive integers with exactly three positive divisors are the squares of prime numbers.

The five smallest such integers are, in ascending order, $2^2$, $3^2$, $5^2$, $7^2$, and $11^2$. The fifth number listed is $11^2=\boxed{121}$.

Let $n$ be the number of trees Jax bought. The three conditions can be written as follows:

1. $n$ is a multiple of 8.

2. $n$ is 1 more than a multiple of 9

3. $n$ is 2 more than a multiple of 10.

In other words, $n = 8a = 9b + 1 = 10c + 2$ for some nonnegative integers $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$

The third condition means that $n$ is one of $2,\, 12,\, 22,\, 32,\ldots$ and so on.  The first number in this sequence that is one more than a multiple of 9 is 82.  Note that if we add a multiple of 90 to 82, the result is also a number that is 2 more than a multiple of 10, and 1 more than a multiple of 9.  Furthermore, these are the only numbers that satisfy the last two conditions.  To see this, we can look at the equations $n = 9b + 1 = 10c + 2.$  Then
\[n - 82 = 9b - 81 = 10c - 80,\]which we can write as $n - 82 = 9(b - 9) = 10(c - 8).$  This tells us $n - 82$ is both a multiple of 9 and 10, so $n - 82$ must be a multiple of 90.

So, $n$ lies in the sequence
\[82, 172, 262, 352, 442, \dots.\]The first number in this sequence that is a multiple of 8 is $\boxed{352}$.

First, note the well-known formula that $1+2+3+\cdots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Thus we are looking for $n$ such that $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is a perfect square. Since $n$ and $n+1$ are relatively prime, the odd one will have to be a perfect square, and the even one will have to be twice a perfect square. Thus we are looking for solutions to $a^2-2b^2=\pm 1$ where $a^2 \ge 4$. It's clear $b=1$ does not work, but trying $b=2$, we find that $2(2^2)+1=9=3^2$. Therefore, $n=2(2^2)=\boxed{8}$ is the smallest solution. We may confirm our answer by checking that $\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2=36^2$ when $n=8$, and indeed $36^2=6^4$ is a perfect fourth power.

Since $T$ must be divisible by $14$, it must be divisible by $2$ and $7$. Since it's divisible by $2$, the last digit must be even, so the units digit must be $0$. $T$ must also be divisible by $7$. Let $R$ be the number obtained by taking $T$ and chopping off the last digit, $0$. In order for $T$ to be divisible by $7$, $R$ must be divisible by $7$, and $R$ must also be made up of $1$'s and $0$'s. If $R$ has one digit, it must be $1$ (since $T\neq 0$), which isn't divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $2$ digits, it must be $10$ or $11$, neither of which are divisible by $7$. If $R$ has $3$ digits, it must be $100$, $101$, $110$, or $111$. Here we can use the divisibility rule for $7$, by chopping off the last digit, multiplying it by two, and subtracting it from the rest, to see that none of these values are divisible by $7$ either. If $R$ has $4$ digits, we can check as we go along: if $R=1000$, then the divisibility rule reduces our checking to whether $100$ is divisible by $7$, and we already know it's not. If $R=1001$, then the divisibility rule asks if $98$ is divisible by $7$--and it is! So $R=1001$ works. This means $T=10010$. We want the quotient $\frac{10010}{14}=\boxed{715}$.

List the primes up to 20 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19) and note that the largest possible prime in the sum is 13 because no two primes add up to $20-17=3$ and of course 19 is too large as well. Also, observe that 2, the only even prime, must be in the sum, because the sum of three odd primes can never be 20. Starting with 2 and 3, we see that $20-(2+3)=15$ is not prime. Next, 2 and 5 give $20-(2+5)=13$, a prime, so one such increasing sequence is 2, 5, 13. Next, we take 2 and 7, and we see that $20-(2+7)=11$ is prime as well, giving us the second sequence 2, 7, 11. 11 and 13 are already included, so we are done. Thus, there are $\boxed{2}$ increasing sequences of three distinct prime numbers that have a sum of 20.

Prime factorize $284=2^2\cdot71$. The sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is

\end{align*}Here we have used the observation that multiplying out $(1+2+2^2)(1+71)$ by distributing yields an expression which is the sum of all $6$ factors of $284.$ Applying this observation again, we find that the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $$(1+2+2^2)(1+5)(1+11)-220=7\cdot 6\cdot 12-220=\boxed{284}.$$

Since $13$ is prime, all of the requested modular inverses exist. Furthermore, the inverses must be distinct: suppose that $a^{-1} \equiv b^{-1} \pmod{13}$. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $ab$, we obtain that $b \equiv ab \cdot a^{-1} \equiv ab \cdot b^{-1} \equiv a \pmod{13}$.

Thus, the set of the inverses of the first $12$ positive integers is simply a permutation of the first $12$ positive integers. Then, \begin{align*}
&1^{-1} + 2^{-1} + \cdots + 12^{-1} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $m^2$ and $n^2$ be the two-digit square numbers; we then have $4 \leq m, n \leq 9$. Putting them next to each other yields a number $100m^2 + n^2$, which must be equal to some other square $x^2$. Rearranging, we have $100m^2 = x^2 - n^2 = (x+n)(x-n)$, so the RHS contains a factor of 100. The biggest possible square is 8181, whose square root is about 90.5, and the smallest is 1616, whose square root is about 40.2, so $41 \leq x \leq 90$. To get the factor of 100, we have two cases:

1. Both $x+n$ and $x-n$ must be multiples of 5. In fact, this means $n = 5$, $x$ is a multiple of 5, and $x-n$, $x$, and $x+n$ are consecutive multiples of 5. Trying possibilities up to $x = 85$, we see that this case doesn't work.

2. One of $x+n$ and $x-n$ is a multiple of 25. Since $x+n = 25$ is impossible, the simplest possibilities are $x-n = 50$ and $x + n = 50$.  The case $x - n = 25$ implies $x + n = 4p^2$ for $(x+n)(x-n)$ to be a perfect square multiple of 100, and thus $57 \leq 4p^2 \leq 77$ from $41 \leq x \leq 90$. The only possibility is $4p^2 = 64$, which leads to non-integral $x$ and $n$. The case $x + n = 50$ requires $x -n = 2p^2$ for $(x+n)(x-n)$ to be a perfect square. To have $x \geq 41$ we must have $x - n \geq 32$, and in fact the lower bound works: $(50)(32) = 1600 = 40^2$. Thus $x = 41$, and $x^2 = \boxed{1681}$.

An integer is divisible by $18$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$ and the last digit is even (meaning it is divisible by both 9 and 2).  The sum of the digits of $-11213141$ is 14.  Since $-11213141$ is negative, this number is 5 $\textit{less than}$ a multiple of 9.  The number is 4 $\textit{more than}$ a multiple of 9.  Subtracting 4 gives  \[-11213141 = -11213145+4.\]Since $-11213145$ has a digit sum of 18, this number is a multiple of 9.  However this is not a multiple of 18 so we need to subtract 9 again: \[-11213141 = -11213154+13.\]Now the number $-11213154$ is a multiple of 18, so the answer is $\boxed{13}$. $$-11213141\equiv 13\pmod {18}.$$

If $a$ is not relatively prime with $24$, then the modular inverse of $a$ does not exist. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $a$ yields that $a^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{24}$, or equivalently that $a^2 - 1 \equiv (a+1)(a-1) \equiv 0 \pmod{24}$. Since $a$ is not divisible by $3$, it follows that at least one of $a+1$ or $a-1$ must be divisible by $3$. Also, since $a$ is not divisible by $2$, then both $a+1$ and $a-1$ are even, and exactly one of them is divisible by $4$. Thus, $3 \times 2 \times 4 = 24$ will always divide into $(a+1)(a-1)$, and so the statement is true for every integer $a$ relatively prime to $24$. The answer is the set of numbers relatively prime to $24$, namely $\{1,5,7,11,13,17,19,23\}$. There are $\boxed{8}$ such numbers.

The number of positive integers smaller than and relatively prime to $24$ is also given by the Euler's totient function.

Extracting Answer from: 
As $p$ is a prime number, it follows that the modular inverses of $1,2, \ldots, p-1$ all exist. We claim that $n^{-1} \cdot (n+1)^{-1} \equiv n^{-1} - (n+1)^{-1} \pmod{p}$ for $n \in \{1,2, \ldots, p-2\}$, in analogue with the formula $\frac{1}{n(n+1)} = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n+1}$. Indeed, multiplying both sides of the congruence by $n(n+1)$, we find that $$1 \equiv n(n+1) \cdot (n^{-1} - (n+1)^{-1}) \equiv (n+1) - n \equiv 1 \pmod{p},$$as desired. Thus, \begin{align*}&1^{-1} \cdot 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1} \cdot 4^{-1} + \cdots + (p-2)^{-1} \cdot (p-1)^{-1} \\ &\equiv 1^{-1} - 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} - 3^{-1} + \cdots - (p-1)^{-1} \pmod{p}.\end{align*}This is a telescoping series, which sums to $1^{-1} - (p-1)^{-1} \equiv 1 - (-1)^{-1} \equiv \boxed{2} \pmod{p}$, since the modular inverse of $-1$ is itself.

To start, notice that $24\cdot 50 = 1200\equiv 1\pmod{1199}$ (in other words, $24$ and $50$ are inverses modulo $1199$).

To solve the congruence $24x\equiv 15\pmod{1199}$, we multiply both sides by $50$ and simplify: \begin{align*}
50\cdot 24x &\equiv 50\cdot 15 \pmod{1199} \\
x &\equiv 750 \pmod{1199}
\end{align*}This process can also be reversed (by multiplying both sides by $50^{-1}=24$), so the solutions to the original congruence are precisely the same as the solutions to $x\equiv 750\pmod{1199}$. The largest negative solution is $750-1199 = \boxed{-449}$.

We use the property that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$.

Since $129 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$ and $96 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$, we have  $$129^{34}+96^{38} \equiv (-3)^{34}+(-3)^{38} \equiv 3^{34}+3^{38} \pmod{11}.$$Since $3^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{11},$ we can see that $3^{34} = (3^5)^{6} \cdot 3^4$ and $3^{38} = (3^5)^{7} \cdot 3^3.$

Then,  \begin{align*}
129^{34}+96^{38}&\equiv (3^5)^{6} \cdot 3^4 + (3^5)^{7} \cdot 3^3\\

Extracting Answer from: 
In order for a number to be a multiple of 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $225=15^2$, the largest perfect square that is less than 225 is $14^2=196$. However, $1+9+6=16$, which is not divisible by 9. The next largest perfect square less than 225 is $13^2=169$, but again, $1+6+9$ is not divisible by 9. Continuing,  $12^2=144$. The sum of the digits of $144$ is $1+4+4=9$, so $\boxed{144}$ is the largest perfect square less than 225 that is a multiple of 9.

Let the base 11 expansion of $10!$ be $a_na_{n-1}\cdots a_1a_0$. This implies that $10! = 11^na_n + 11^{n-1}a_{n-1} + \cdots 11a_1 + a_0$. Note that $10!$ is not divisible by $11$, because $11$ is prime. As a result, if $a_0 = 0$, then the right-hand side of that equation would be divisible by $11$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $a_0 \neq 0$, and $10!$ ends in $\boxed{0}$ zeroes when written in base 11.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can write out what $11011_b$ means in terms of powers of $b$: $$11011_b = b^4+b^3+b+1.$$Multiplying this by $b-1$ gives \begin{align*}
11011_b &= (b-1)b^4 + (b-1)b^3 + (b-1)b + (b-1) \\
&= b^5 - b^4 + b^4 - b^3 + b^2 - b + b - 1 \\
&= b^5 - b^3 + b^2 - 1.
\end{align*}Now $$1001_b = b^3 + 1,$$so when we add this to the result above, we get $b^5+b^2$, which is written in base $b$ as $\boxed{100100}$.

Instead of taking this algebraic approach, you can also think in terms of base-$b$ long arithmetic (note that each $(b-1)$ below represents a single digit): $$\begin{array}{r *5{c@{~}}c}
&& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
\times &&&&&& (b-1) \\
\hline
&& (b-1) & (b-1) & 0 & (b-1) & (b-1) \\
\\
\\
& \stackrel{1}{\phantom{(0)}} & \stackrel{1}{(b-1)} & (b-1) & \stackrel{1}{\phantom{(}0\phantom{)}} & \stackrel{1}{(b-1)} & (b-1) \\
+ &&& 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\hline
& 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}$$Note that no carries are needed in the multiplication step, since $b-1$ is a digit in base $b$. Carries are needed in the addition step, since $(b-1)+1=10_b$.

The expression $\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is negative if $n$ is less than $-1$ or greater than $13$, so $n$ must be between 0 and $12$ inclusive.  Also, since $\frac{n+1}{13-n}$ is prime, it must be greater than or equal to 2.  Solving \begin{align*}
\frac{n+1}{13-n} &\geq 2 \\
n+1 &\geq 26-2n \\

Extracting Answer from: 
In base $3$, the place values are $\ldots\ldots, 3^4, 3^3, 3^2, 3, 1$. Notice that all of these except the last two are divisible by $3^2=9$. Thus, the last two digits of $a-b$ in base $3$ are the base-$3$ representation of the remainder when $a-b$ is divided by $9$. (This is just like how the last two digits of an integer in base $10$ represent its remainder when divided by $100$.)

For similar reasons, we know that $a\equiv 5\pmod 9$ and $b\equiv 5\cdot 6+3=33\pmod{6^2}$. This last congruence tells us that $b$ is $33$ more than a multiple of $36$, but any multiple of $36$ is also a multiple of $9$, so we can conclude that $b\equiv 33\equiv 6\pmod 9$.

Finally, we have $$a-b \equiv 5-6 \equiv -1 \equiv 8 \pmod 9.$$This remainder, $8$, is written in base $3$ as $22_3$, so the last two digits of $a-b$ in base $3$ are $\boxed{22}$.

Note that the prime factorization of $210$ is $2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7$, and so the prime factorization of $210^3$ is $2^3\cdot 3^3\cdot 5^3\cdot 7^3$.

Given that $\gcd(a,b)=210$ and $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]=210^3$, we must have $a=2^k\cdot 3^\ell\cdot 5^m\cdot 7^n$ and $b=2^p\cdot 3^q\cdot 5^r\cdot 7^s$ where each of the ordered pairs $(k,p),(\ell,q),(m,r),(n,s)$ is either $(1,3)$ or $(3,1)$. Therefore, if we ignore the condition $a<b$, there are independently two choices for each of $k$, $\ell$, $m$, and $n$, and these choices determine both of the numbers $a$ and $b$. We have $2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2=16$ ways to make all four choices.

However, these $16$ sets of choices will generate each possible pair of values for $a$ and $b$ in both possible orders. Half of these choices will satisfy $a<b$ and half will satisfy $a>b$. So, imposing the condition $a<b$, we see that there are $\frac{16}{2}=\boxed{8}$ possible choices for $a$.

Let the total sum be $S$. The number on each face is added to $S$ four separate times, since each face borders on $4$ vertices. There are $8$ vertices, and each is the sum of $3$ face numbers since each vertex borders $3$ faces. Thus $S$ is the sum of $8\cdot 3=24$ face numbers. Since each face is added $4$ times, and there are $6$ faces, we know none of the faces are repeated or left out and each is added exactly $4$ times,  so $S=4(\text{sum of numbers on faces})$. Thus no matter what the sum of the numbers on the faces is, the total sum $S$ is always divisible by $\boxed{4}$.

The prime factorization of 72 is $2^3\cdot 3^2$, which has $(3+1)(2+1) = 12$ factors.

If we multiply by 2, we get $2^4\cdot 3^2$, which has $(4+1)(2+1) = 15$ factors.  Multiplying by any higher power of 2 gives a product with more than 16 positive factors.

Multiplying by 3 gives $2^3\cdot 3^3$, which has $(3+1)(3+1) = 16$ positive factors.

Multiplying by any prime $p$ gives $2^3 \cdot 3^2\cdot p$, which has $(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 24$ factors.

Similarly, multiplying by any other positive integer besides those we've considered produces a product that has more than 16 factors.  Therefore, $2^3\cdot 3^3 = \boxed{216}$ is the only positive multiple of 72 with 16 positive factors.

Extracting Answer from: 
The new side lengths of the rectangle can be written as $(1.3a)(0.8b)$ and $(1.3b)(0.8a)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the original side lengths. Since both of these are integers, we know that $a$ and $b$ must both be divisible by $5$. Therefore, let $a=5m$ and $b=5n$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers. 

The new side lengths can now be written as $13m/10 \cdot 4n/5$ and $13n/10 \cdot 4m/5$, which simplifies to $26mn/5$ and $52mn/25$, respectively. 

The area of the new rectangle is $(26mn/5) \cdot (52mn/25) = 1352m^2n^2/125$, which is an integer. The smallest possible such integer occurs when $m=n=1$. In this case, the area is $1352/125=\boxed{10.816}$ square units.

We get that $555- 4 \cdot 125 = 55$. The largest power of $5$ that is less than $55$ is $5^2=25$, and the greatest multiple of $25$ less than $55$ is $2$.

If you notice that 340 is close to $7^3=343=1000_7$, then it makes the problem much easier. Since $343=1000_7$, that makes $342=666_7$, or the largest three-digit number in base 7. To get 340, we subtract 2, which means subtracting 2 from the digit in the $7^0$ place. That leaves us with $\boxed{664_7}$.

Alternatively, the largest power of 7 less than 340 is $7^2=49$, and the largest multiple of 49 less than 340 is $6\cdot49=294$. That means there is a 6 in the $7^2$ place. We have $340-294=46$ left, which can be represented as $6\cdot7^1+4\cdot7^0$. So, we get $340=6\cdot7^2+6\cdot7^1+4\cdot7^0=\boxed{664_7}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's multiply the divisors of a positive integer, say $12$.  The divisors of $12$ are $1,2,3,4,6,$ and $12$.  The product of the divisors of 12 is $1\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot6\cdot12=(1\cdot12)(2\cdot 6)(3\cdot4)=12^3$.  The factors may be regrouped in this way for any positive integer with an even number of divisors. We have found that if the number $d$ of divisors is even, then the product of the divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$.  Solving $n^6=n^{d/2}$, we find $d=12$.

Recall that we can determine the number of factors of $n$ by adding $1$ to each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$ and multiplying the results.  We work backwards to find the smallest positive integer with $12$ factors.  Twelve may be written as a product of integers greater than 1 in four ways: $12$, $2\cdot 6$, $3\cdot 4$, and $2\cdot2\cdot3$.  The prime factorizations which give rise to these products have sets of exponents $\{11\}$, $\{5,1\}$, $\{3,2\}$, and $\{2,1,1\}$.  In each case, we minimize $n$ by assigning the exponents in decreasing order to the primes $2,3,5,\ldots$.  Therefore, the smallest positive integer with 12 factors must be in the list $2^{11}=2048$, $2^5\cdot3=96$, ${2^3\cdot3^2}=72$, and $2^2\cdot3\cdot5=60$.  The smallest of these is $\boxed{60}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $a$ be the number of quarters. We know that \begin{align*}
a\equiv 3\pmod 5\\
a\equiv 5\pmod 7
\end{align*} Congruence $(1)$ means that there exists a non-negative integer $n$ such that $a=3+5n$. Substituting this into $(b)$ gives \[3+5n\equiv 5\pmod 7\implies n\equiv 6\pmod 7\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $6$. Then $n\ge 6\implies a=3+5n\ge 33$. $33$ happens to satisfy both congruences, so it is the smallest common solution. Since she has less than $10$ dollars worth of quarters, she has less than $40$ quarters. If $b$ is a common solution, subtracting $33$ from both sides of both congruences gives \begin{align*}
b-33\equiv -30\equiv 0\pmod 5\nonumber\\
b-33\equiv -28\equiv 0\pmod 7\nonumber

For $n$ to have an inverse $\pmod{130}$, it is necessary for $n$ to be relatively prime to 130. Conversely, if $n$ is relatively prime to 130, then $n$ has an inverse $\pmod{130}$.  The same holds for 231.  Therefore we are looking for the smallest positive $n$ that is relatively prime to 130 and 231.

We can factor $130=2\cdot5\cdot13$ and $231=3\cdot7\cdot11$.  These are all of the primes up to 13, so none of the integers $2-16$ is relatively prime to both 130 and 231.  However, 17 is relatively prime to both of these numbers.   So the smallest positive integer greater than 1 that has a multiplicative inverse modulo 130 and 231 is $\boxed{17}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Our common strategy when multiplying two numbers is to do it digit by digit, starting from the rightmost digits. 

Let's start with the rightmost digits of the two numbers. It is easy to see that the product of  $6_8 \cdot 7_8$ is $42_8$. Therefore, we have the last digit of the result.

Next, we move left and multiply the next digits of the numbers. $6_8 \cdot 7_8 = 42_8$, but there is no space for $42_8$; we must instead carry the $4$. Therefore, the next digit of the result is actually $4 + 4 = 10$, with a carry of $1$.

Continuing this process to the leftmost digits, we get that $6_8 \cdot 7_8 = 42_8$, which gives a final answer of $\boxed{50}_8.$

The problem is greatly simplified by defining the sequence $C=\{c_0,c_1,c_2,\ldots\}$ as $c_n=a_n+b_n$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Then $c_0=a_0+b_0=0+1=1$ and $c_1=a_1+b_1=1+2=3$. Additionally, for integers $n>1$ we have \begin{align*}
c_n&=a_n+b_n\\
&=(a_{n-1} +b_{n-2})+(a_{n-2} +b_{n-1})\\
&=(a_{n-2}+b_{n-2})+(a_{n-1}+b_{n-1})\\
&=c_{n-2}+c_{n-1}.
\end{align*} This is convenient since we want to determine the remainder of $a_{50}+b_{50}=c_{50}$. Thus, we no longer have to think about the sequences $A$ and $B$, but only about $C$.

The first few terms of $C$ are $1,3,4,7,11,18,29$. When reduced modulo $5$, these terms are $1,3,4,2,1,3,4$. The first four terms are $1,3,4,2$. These continue repeating $\pmod 5$ because the next two terms are $1,3$ and all terms are defined as the sum of the preceding two. Since the cycle has length $4$ and $50\equiv 2\pmod 4$, we have $$c_{50} \equiv c_2 \pmod 5,$$ and thus $c_{50}\equiv \boxed{4}\pmod 5$.

Then $2^{\frac{306}{n}} 3^{\frac{340}{n}}$ is an integer whose $n$th power is $a$. Conversely, suppose $b^n = a$. Then the only primes which divide $b$ are $2$ and $3$. Choose $c$ and $d$ so that $b=2^{c} 3^{d}$. Then $b^n = 2^{cn} 3^{dn} = 2^{306} 3^{340}$, which implies $n \mid 306$ and $n \mid 340$. This concludes our proof of the claim that $a$ is an $n$th power if and only if $n$ divides both $306$ and $340$.

The largest number which simultaneously divides two numbers is their GCD. Using the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD of $306$ and $340$ is the same as the GCD of $340$ and $340-306 = 34$. Since $34$ divides $340$, the GCD of these two is $34$, so the largest possible $n$ is $\boxed{34}$.

Note the prime factorizations $700=2^2\cdot 5^2\cdot 7$ and $7000=2^3\cdot 5^3\cdot 7$.

If $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[r,700]=7000$, then in particular, $r$ is a divisor of $7000$, so we can write $r=2^\alpha\cdot 5^\beta\cdot 7^\gamma$, where $0\le\alpha\le 3$, $0\le\beta\le 3$, and $0\le\gamma\le 1$.

Moreover, we know that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[r,700]=2^{\max\{\alpha,2\}}\cdot 5^{\max\{\beta,2\}}\cdot 7^{\max\{\gamma,1\}}$, and we know that this is equal to $7000=2^3\cdot 5^3\cdot 7$. This is possible only if $\alpha=3$ and $\beta=3$, but $\gamma$ can be $0$ or $1$, giving us two choices for $r$: $$r = 2^3\cdot 5^3\cdot 7^0 = 1000 \text{~~or~~} r=2^3\cdot 5^3\cdot 7^1 = 7000.$$So the sum of all solutions is $1000+7000=\boxed{8000}$.

Start off by looking for a pattern. $(13^1 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder; $(13^2 + 5)/6$ leaves no remainder, ..., $(13^k +5)/6$ always leaves no remainder. This is true because $13$ is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, so any power of $13$ will also be $1$ more than a multiple of $6$. When $5$ is added to a number that is $1$ more than a multiple of $6$, the result is a multiple of $6$, so the remainder is $\boxed{0}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Note that exactly two of every four consecutive integers are divisible by 2. Therefore, since the ones digit of the product of four consecutive positive integers is 4, none of the integers is divisible by 5 (else the product $2\times5$ would make the units digit 0). Thus, the four consecutive integers can only have ones digits 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively, or 6, 7, 8, 9 respectively. Indeed, the units digit of both $1\times2\times3\times4=24$ and $6\times7\times8\times9=3024$ is 4. We wish to minimize the four integers given that their product is greater than 1000, so we take the bigger ones digits (to have smaller tens digits). $6\times7\times8\times9>1000$, so we are done. The desired sum is $6+7+8+9=\boxed{30}$.

The integers from 1 to 100 that leave a remainder of 1 are 1, 6, 11, $\dots$, 96.  If we subtract 1 from each of these numbers, we get 0, 5, 10, $\dots$, 95.  If we divide each of these numbers by 5, then we get 0, 1, 2, $\dots$, 19.  Finally, if we add 1 to each of these numbers, then we get 1, 2, 3, $\dots$, 20.  Therefore, the number of terms in 1, 6, 11, $\dots$, 96 is the same as the number of terms in 1, 2, 3, $\dots$, 20, which is $\boxed{20}$.

By listing all the positive integer divisors of 100, we find that the requested product is $1\times2\times4\times5\times10\times20\times25\times50\times100$. Pair 1 with 100, 2 with 50, 4 with 25, and 5 with 20  to obtain 4 factors of 100, leaving one more factor of 10. In total, the product is $(100^4)(10)=10^9=\boxed{1,\!000,\!000,\!000}$. Notice that this method may be generalized to show that for all positive integers $n$, the product of the the positive integer divisors of $n$ is $n^{d/2}$ where $d$ is the number of divisors of $n$.

Recall that a terminating decimal can be written as $\frac{a}{10^b} = \frac{a}{2^b\cdot5^b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Since $k$ can be expressed as a terminating decimal, then $1+2x = 5^b$, as $1+2x$ is odd for all $x$ and, thus, can't equal $2^b$ or $10^b$. Thus, our sum is equal to $\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{25}+\frac{1}{125}+\cdots = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{1-\frac{1}{5}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$, by the formula $a/(1-r)$ for the sum of an infinite geometric series with common ratio $r$ (between $-1$ and 1) and first term $a$.

For the number to be as small as possible, we want the digit at the left to be as small as possible. The smallest thousands digit is $3$, the smallest hundreds digit is $4$, and the smallest tens digit is $5$. However, $3+4+5=12$, so then the ones digit must be $0$, and that is impossible because then it would be smaller than $3456$. We also cannot move up the tens digit, because that would make the digits add up to a number greater than $12$. Thus, we move to the hundreds digit, and the next smallest possible number for it would be $5$. Now we have $35ab$, where $a+b=12-3-5=4$. Since we want the left digit to be as small as possible, we have the number $\boxed{3504}$.

Let a common solution be $a$. Then we know \begin{align*}
a\equiv 3 & \pmod 4\\
a\equiv 1 & \pmod 3\\
a\equiv 1 & \pmod 5
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(3,5)=1$, $(2)$ and $(3)$ together yield $a\equiv 1\pmod {3\cdot 5}$ which is the same as $a\equiv 1\pmod {15}$. Then there exists an integer $n$ such that $a=1+15n$. Substituting this into $(1)$ gives \[1+15n\equiv 3\pmod 4\implies n\equiv 2\pmod 4\] So $n$ has a lower bound of $2$. Then $n\ge 2\implies a=1+15n\ge 31$. $31$ satisfies the original congruences so subtracting it from both sides of each gives \begin{align*}
a-31\equiv -28\equiv 0 & \pmod 4\nonumber\\
a-31\equiv -30\equiv 0 & \pmod 3\nonumber\\
a-31\equiv -30\equiv 0 & \pmod 5\nonumber
\end{align*} Since $\gcd(3,4)=\gcd(4,5)=\gcd(3,5)=1$, we have $a-31\equiv 0\pmod {3\cdot 4\cdot 5}$, that is, $a\equiv 31\pmod{60}$.

Note that any solution of the above congruence also satisfies the original ones. Then the two solutions are $31$ and $60+31=91$. Thus, $31+91=\boxed{122}$.

In order for a number to be divisible by 12, it must be divisible by 4 and 3. For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. In this problem, the number $d8$ must be divisible by 4. This limits the possibilities of $d$ to $0$, $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Since, $5+9+1+3+8=26$, the numbers that satisfy this condition are $1$, $4$, and $7$. The only digit that satisfies both conditions is $d=4$, so the sum of all of the digits that could replace $d$ is $\boxed{4}$.

First, let us convert $629_{10}$ to each of the two bases. To convert to base 7, we realize $7^{4}>629_{10}>7^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base seven will have four digits. $7^{3}=343$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot343 = 286$ for the next three digits. $7^{2}=49$ goes into 286 five times at most, leaving us with $286-5\cdot49 = 41$. Then, $7^{1}=7$ goes into 41 five times at most, leaving $41-5\cdot7 = 6$ for the ones digit. All together, the base seven equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1556_{7}$.

To convert to base 8, we realize similarly that $8^{4}>629_{10}>8^{3}$. So, we can tell that $629_{10}$ in base eight will have four digits. $8^{3}=512$, which can go into 629 only one time at most, leaving $629-1\cdot512 = 117$ for the next three digits. $8^{2}=64$ goes into 117 one time at most, leaving us with $117-1\cdot64 = 53$. Then, $8^{1}=8$ goes into 53 six times at most, leaving $53-6\cdot8 = 5$ for the ones digit. All together, the base eight equivalent of $629_{10}$ is $1165_{8}$.

Finally, comparing $1556_{7}$ and $1165_{8}$, we find that digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both numbers.  Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ digits in common.

We have the prime factorizations $132=2^2\cdot 3\cdot 11$ and $100=2^2\cdot 5^2$, so, taking the maximum exponent of each prime, we obtain $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[132,100] = 2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5^2\cdot 11 = (2^2\cdot 5^2)(3\cdot 11) = (100)(33) = \boxed{3300}.$$(We could also note that the common prime factors of $132$ and $100$ are just $2^2$, which tells us that $\gcd(132,100)=4$ and so $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[132,100]=\frac{13200}{4}=3300$.)

Extracting Answer from: 
The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1375$ is $11 \cdot 5^3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $11$ in the numerator. There are $\left\lfloor\frac{1000}{11}\right\rfloor=90$ multiples of $11$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\boxed{90}$ integers values for $n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Because $3^6=729<2007<2187=3^7$, it is convenient to begin by counting the number of base-3 palindromes with at most 7 digits. There are two palindromes of length 1, namely 1 and 2.  There are also two palindromes of length 2, namely 11 and 22.  For $n\geq 1$, each palindrome of length $2n+1$ is obtained by inserting one of the digits $0$, $1$,  or $2$ immediately after the $n\text{th}$ digit in a palindrome of length $2n$.  Each palindrome of length $2n+2$ is obtained by similarly inserting one of the strings $00$, $11$,  or $22$.  Therefore there are 6 palindromes of each of the lengths 3 and 4, 18 of each of the lengths 5 and 6, and 54 of length 7. Because the base-3 representation of 2007 is 2202100, that integer is less than each of the palindromes 2210122, 2211122, 2212122, 2220222, 2221222, and 2222222.  Thus the required total is $2+2+6+6+18+18+54-6=\boxed{100}$.

2196 base 3 is 1000000000 base 3. Since $3^{7} = 2187 < 2007 < 3^{8} = 6561$, every 4-digit palindrome has a unique left half.  (We do not count 3-digit palindromes.) Thus, the number of palindromes is simply twice the number of 4-digit palindromes, since there are two possible complete palindromes for each left half. 30 of the 81 possible 4-digit base-3 numbers are palindromes, so the number of palindromes made from the first 2007 numbers in base 3 is $2\cdot30=\boxed{60}$.

To test for palindromes, one may convert to base 10 or use mental arithmetic: $1_{3}$, $2_{3}$, and $0_{3}$ all read the same in either direction, so are palindromes; $11_{3}$ and $22_{3}$ are also palindromes, but $10_{3}$, $12_{3}$, $20_{3}$, and $21_{3}$ are not; for 3-digit base-3 numbers, the third digit is determined by the first two, so there are no other palindromes.

Add $-r^2-2r-4$ to both sides of the given congruence to obtain $2r\equiv -3\pmod{55}$. We can multiply both sides by $28$ to get $56r \equiv -3\cdot 28\pmod{55}$. Subtracting $55r$ from the left-hand side and adding $2\cdot 55=110$ to the right-hand side gives $r\equiv 26\pmod{55}$. Thus $r=26+55k$ for some integer $k$. Solving $26+55k\geq 1000$, we find that $k=18$ is the smallest value of $k$ for which $r$ has four digits. Thus the minimum four-digit value of $r$ is $26+55(18)=\boxed{1016}$.

For integer $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ must be divisible by $11$. The only possibilities for $a-b+c-d$ are $-11$, $0$, and $11$.
Possibility 1: $1-b+c-4=-11 \implies c-b=-8$. This gives us two possible values: $c=0, b=8$, and $c=1, b=9$.
Possibility 2: $1-b+c-4=0 \implies c-b=3$. This gives us $7$ possible values, where $c$ is any integer from $3$ to $9$, and $b=c-3$.
Possibility 3: $1-b+c-4=11 \implies c-b=14$. This is impossible since the digit $c$ cannot be greater than $14$,  Thus there are a total of $2+7=\boxed{9}$ possible values.

A way of obtaining all good integers is by analyzing all possible times and removing the colon. Therefore, we get that the integers between 100 and 159 are good, along with the integer 200. Therefore, the integers between 160 and 199 are all bad. Since we can write an integer equivalent to 3 mod 4 in the from $4k+3$, we have to solve the inequalities $4k+3 \ge 160$ and $4k+3 \le 199$. The first inequality has solution $k \ge \frac{157}{4}$, and the second inequality has solution $k \le 49$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $k$ is between 40 and 49.

Let $n=2m$. Let $b$ be the number of cars that Ray originally had. Clearly $b=6a$ for some positive integer $a$. Additionally, \begin{align*} b-2\equiv 0\pmod n&\implies 6a\equiv 2\pmod {2m} \\ &\implies 3a\equiv 1\pmod m.\end{align*} Such $a$ exists if and only if $3$ is invertible modulo $m$. In other words, $\gcd(3,m)=1$. We have that $n<10\implies m=\frac{n}{2}<5$. The only $0<m<5$ relatively prime to $3$ are $1,2,4$. Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ possible values of $n$: $2$, $4$, and $8$.

If we are only interested in the units digit of a product of several numbers, we may drop any digits other than units digits as they will not affect the units digit of the product.  Bringing in each factor one at a time, we find:

\begin{tabular}{r}
The units digit of $\,7^1\,$ is 7, \\
$7\times7\,$ ends in 9, so the units digit of $\,7^2\,$ is 9, \\
$9\times7\,$ ends in 3, so the units digit of $\,7^3\,$ is 3, \\
$3\times7\,$ ends in 1, so the units digit of $\,7^4\,$ is 1, \\

Let $abc$ represent the three-digit number in base 3, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ each represent a digit 0, 1 or 2. The place values in base 3 are 9, 3 and 1, so the base-ten value of $abc$ is $a \times 9 + b \times 3 + c \times 1$, which can be written as $9a + 3b + c$. This same value is $cba$ in base 4, which we can  write as $16c + 4b + a$. Equating these two expressions, we get $9a + 3b + c = 16c + 4b + a$. We can simplify this to $8a = 15c + b$. Now, there are only three digits to try for each letter. It turns out that $8 \times 2 = 15 \times 1 + 1$, so the base-three number is $211_3$ and the base-four number is $112_4$. The  base-ten value is $(2 \times 9) + (1 \times 3) + 1 = 18 + 3 + 1 = 22$. To confirm this answer, we check the base-four value: $1 \times 16 + 1 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 16 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{22}.$

Continuing with two-digit numbers, we note that the digits must be $4$ and $0$, $1$ and $3$, or $2$ and $2$.  This means that $13$, $22$, $31$, and $40$ are the only two-digit numbers whose digits sum to 4.  For the three-digit numbers, we organize the work in a table.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
Possible Digits&Possible Numbers&Total Possibilities\\\hline
4,0,0&400&1\\\hline
3,1,0&103, 130, 301, 310&4\\\hline
2,2,0&202, 220&2\\\hline
2,1,1&112, 121, 211&3\\\hline
\end{tabular}Adding up the last column, we see that there are $10$ three-digits numbers whose digits add up to $4$.  Adding those to the possible one-and-two digit numbers, we get $\boxed{15}$ pages in the textbook which have digits that add up to $4$.

We can re-write the requirements of this problem as: \begin{align*}k &\equiv1\pmod{3}\\
k &\equiv1\pmod{4},\\
k &\equiv1\pmod{5},\\
k &\equiv1\pmod{6},\\
k &\equiv1\pmod{7}.
\end{align*}In other words, $k-1$ is divisible by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. We have  \begin{align*}
\text{lcm}[3,4,5,6,7] &= \text{lcm}[3,4,5,7] \\
&= 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 7 \\&= 420,
\end{align*}and thus $k-1$ must be divisible by $420$. The only two multiples of $420$ under $1000$ are $420$ and $840$, so the largest possible value of $k$ is $840+1 = \boxed{841}$.
