Extracting Answer from: 
If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.

If John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.

If John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.

If John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.

If John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.

Finally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.

Thus, of all of the possibilities, spinning a 4 or 10 next could result in 3 additional spins, so the maximum total number of spins is $\boxed{4}$. These would be achieved by spinning 20, 10, 2, 1 or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $1$ divides every integer, we need only find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers $2$ through $10$.  Their prime factorizations are, respectively, $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\cdot 3, 7, 2^3, 3^2, 2\cdot 5$.   In its own prime factorization, the LCM must have each prime that appears in this list, raised to at minimum the highest power that appears in the list for that prime, in order for it to divide all of the integers from $2$ through $10$.  Thus, the prime factorization of the LCM is $2^3\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5\cdot 7$. So the LCM is $8\cdot 9\cdot 5\cdot 7 = \boxed{2520}$.

An integer is divisible by 4 if and only if a number formed from the last two digits is divisible by 4. If the units digit is 0, all the numbers with even tens digits are divisible by 4 (00, 20, 40, 60, 80), and all the numbers with odd tens digits are not (10, 30, 50, 70, 90). Since there are the same number of even digits as odd digits, there is a $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that $N$ is divisible by 4.

The probability of an integer being divisible by 4 is $\frac{1}{4}$, since the last two digits are the divisor we seek. There are 1000 numbers between 100 and 999, and a quarter of them are divisible by 4, since the last two digits of every fourth one are divisible by 4. Noting that N is divisible by 10, there are 100 such numbers, so the probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The area of the circle inscribed inside the semicircle is $ \pi r^2 \Rightarrow \pi(2^2) = 4 \pi .$ The area of the larger circle (semicircle's area x 2) is $ \pi r^2 \Rightarrow \pi(4^2)= 16 \pi$ (the diameter of the inscribed circle, $4$, is the same as the radius of the semicircle). Thus, the area of the semicircle is $\frac{1}{2}(16 \pi) \Rightarrow 8 \pi .$ The fraction of the semicircle that is unshaded is $\frac{4 \pi}{8 \pi} = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the fraction of the semicircle that is shaded is $1 - \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The fractions at the beginning and end are equivalent to $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}$, so we can write the expression as $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}$. Recall that an exponent law states that $n^{a} \cdot n^{b} = n^{a+b}$, so we can write the expression as $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{4}$. Because $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{2^{4}}{3^{4}}$. This is $\boxed{\frac{16}{81}}.$

Since the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is 40 and $AB=8$, then $BC=5$.

Therefore, $MBCN$ is a trapezoid with height 5 and parallel bases of lengths 4 and 2, so has area $$\frac{1}{2}(5)(4+2)=\boxed{15}.$$

First, let's ignore the requirement that the product can't be $6$. Then I can pick the first blue face in $6$ ways, and the second blue face in $5$ ways, making $6\cdot 5 = 30$ choices in all. But we've actually counted each possible result twice, because it makes no difference which of the two blue faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the number of different pairs of faces is really $(6\cdot 5)/2$, or $15$.

Now we exclude the pairs which have a product of $6$. There are two such pairs: $\{1,6\}$ and $\{2,3\}$. That leaves me $\boxed{13}$ pairs of faces I can paint blue.

$1001$ is the smallest integer greater than $1000$. It also happens to be a multiple of $11$, since $1001 = 11 \cdot 91$. So $1001$ is the smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $1000$ and thus $x = 1001$.

The greatest multiple of $11$ that is less than $11^2 = 11 \cdot 11$ is  $$11 \cdot (11 - 1) = 11 \cdot 10 = 110$$Thus $y = 110$, and we compute $$x - y = 1001 - 110 = \boxed{891}$$

A Venn diagram is helpful in explaining the solution. Let an oval patch represent the set of students taking French and another oval represent those taking Spanish. In the diagram, observe that the intersection (overlap) of the two oval patches represents the set of students taking both French and Spanish (see region B). We begin by placing 3 xs in region B, representing the students taking both French and Spanish. Region A represents the set taking French alone. Since the totals in regions A and B must be 8, we place 5 xs in region A. Similarly we place 9 xs in region C. D represents the set taking neither French nor Spanish. In the second Venn diagram, each x represents a student. Observe that the total number of xs in regions A, B, and C is 17. Therefore D has $30-17=\boxed{13}$ students.

Let $m$ represent the total number of muffins in the original batch.  Hence, each tray contains $\frac{m}{6}$ muffins and $5$ croissants, for a total of $\frac{m}{6}+5$ baked goods.  We know that this value is at least $20$, hence we have the inequality \[ \frac{m}{6}+5 \ge 20.\]To solve, we first subtract $5$ from both sides of the inequality, yielding $\frac{m}{6} \ge 15$, and then multiply both sides by $6$ to get $m \ge 90.$

Therefore the original batch contained at least $\boxed{90}$ muffins.

Therefore, every number in the form $n \cdot 9$ works, as long as $n$ is positive and at most $111$.  There are $111$ such values of $n$, so there are $\boxed{111}$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $1000$.

Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.

If the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.

Since the railroad trestle is a straight path connecting the two cliffs, we know that after the train has traveled $3/4$ of the trestle's length, the train has traveled both $3/4$ the horizontal distance between the two cliffs and the $3/4$ of the vertical distance between the cliffs' heights. The difference between the heights of the two cliffs is $172-112=60$ feet. $3/4$ of that difference is $45$ feet. Since the train started from the higher cliff and was moving toward the lower cliff, it has descended $45$ feet from its original altitude of $172$ feet.

Recall that division should be done before addition. So, we consider $8 \div 2 \div 2$ first. Remember that we do the division from left to right. We get \[8 \div 2 \div 2 = (8 \div 2) \div 2 = 4 \div 2 = 2.\] Finally, \[8 \div 2 \div 2 + 6=2+6=\boxed{8}.\]

Since $25<30<36$, we have $5<\sqrt{30}<6$. We also know that $7^2=49$, so $\sqrt{50}\approx7$. As a result, $(5+7)<\sqrt{30}+\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$, so the sum is located between $\boxed{12\text{ and }13}$.

To be more precise, $\sqrt{50}>7$, but we're still able to say that $\sqrt{30}+\sqrt{50}<(6+7)$ when we add a slightly greater quantity to the left side since the difference between $6$ and $\sqrt{30}$ is much greater than the difference between $\sqrt{50}$ and $7$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we check how many of the numbers from $1$ to $109$ are multiples of $3$. We divide $109$ by $3$, and it comes out to be $36$ and a bit. So we know this gives us $36$ times the factor $3$ appears, to begin with.

Now, some numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so they have $3$ as a factor twice, and we've only counted them once so far! There are $12$ multiples of $9$ less than $109$, and we need to add one to our exponent for each of these. That gives another $12$ to the exponent.

Some numbers are also multiples of $3^3=27$. (Horrible, isn't it?) We actually have four such numbers: $27$, $54$, $81$, and $108$. We've counted two $3$s for each of them, so now we need to count one more for each, adding another $4$ to the exponent.

One more time. What about $3^4=81$? Yes, we do have a multiple of $81$ among our numbers. So we add one more to the exponent, and at last we've gotten all of them.

Finally, we end up with a total of $36+12+4+1=\boxed{53}$ in the exponent.

We can check each number one by one.

1: 1 is a factor of 34 since $1\cdot34=34$ .

2: 2 is a factor of 34 since $2\cdot17=34$ .

3: 3 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 3 to get 34. ( $34\div3$ gives a quotient of 11 and a  remainder of 1.) There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 3 ( $3\div7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder 3.)

4: 4 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 4 to get 34.  ($34 \div 4$ gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 2.)  There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 4.  ($4 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.)

8:  8 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\div8$ gives a quotient of 4 and a  remainder of 2) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 8 ( $8\div7$ gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder 1).

14: 14 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot2=14$ .

17: 17 is a factor of 34 since $17\cdot2=34$ .

29: 29 is not a factor of 34, since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\div29$ gives a quotient of 1 and a  remainder of 5) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 29 ( $29\div7$ gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder 1).

56: 56 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot8=56$ .

91: 91 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot13=91$ .

So, $\boxed{6}$ of the 10 numbers are factors of 34 or multiples of 7.

If the length of the radius of a circle is multiplied by a factor of $k$, then the area of the circle is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$.  Since the larger circle has area 4 times greater than that of each smaller circle, the length of its radius is 2 times greater.  Therefore, the length of its radius is $2\times 4\text{ inches}=\boxed{8}$ inches.

By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.

Because 120 is a multiple of 40, every divisor of 40 is also a divisor of 120. Thus, if a number is a divisor of 40, it is automatically a factor of 120 too. The problem is asking "How many positive integers are factors of 40?". Listing out the factors, we get \[1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\]Counting, we see there are $\boxed{8}$ positive integers.

If the perimeter of the room is 48 feet, then the semiperimeter is half that or 24 feet. This is the sum of the length and the width. The  part-to-part ratio $5:3$ is a total of 8 parts, so each part must be worth $24 \div 8 = 3$ feet.

GPT File: 4-7-MATH-test-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1154_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Option 1: Using Algebra

Let's assume that the length of the room is 5x and the width is 3x. 

The perimeter is equal to 2 times the length plus 2 times the width: 

$2(5x) + 2(3x) = 48$

Simplifying: 

$16x = 48$ 

$x = 3$ 

So the length is 5x = 15 feet and the width is 3x = 9 feet. 

The area is equal to length times width: 

$15 \cdot 9 = \boxed{135}$ square feet.


Option 2: Without Algebra

We know that the rectangle's perimeter is 48 feet, which means that each side length of the rectangle is 48/4 = 12 feet. 

The length of the rectangle is 5/8 of the perimeter and the width is 3/8 of the perimeter: 

$5/8 \cdot 12 \cdot 3/8 \cdot 12 = \boxed{135}$ square feet.

The numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4 and 5 are 22, 42, 62, and so on.  Checking these numbers for a remainder of 2 when divided by both 3 and 6 yields $\boxed{62}$ as the smallest.

We also might have noted that the desired number is 2 greater than a number that is a multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Therefore, it is 2 greater than the least common multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The least common multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6 is $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 5 = 60$, so the smallest number that fits the problem is $60 + 2 = \boxed{62}$.

Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$.  Since there are four times as many right-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is $4x$.  Since there are twice as many left-handed girls as left-handed boys, and there are $x$ left-handed boys, there are $2x$ left-handed girls.  We place all of this in a Venn diagram:

label(scale(0.8)*"$2x$",(28,45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$4x$",(63,45));

We also know that half the girls on the team are left-handed.  Since there are $2x$ left-handed girls, there are also $2x$ right-handed girls.

Extracting Answer from: 
The smallest number of marbles that can be broken up into bags of $18$ or bags of $42$ must be the least common multiple of both $18$ and $42$.  Factoring, $18 = 2\cdot 3^2$ and $42 = 2\cdot 3\cdot 7$.  The prime factorization of the least common multiple must include $2$, $3^2$, and $7$, and no other primes.  Thus, the answer is $2\cdot 3^2 \cdot 7 = \boxed{126}$.

If the ambulance travels at 40 miles per hour and takes a 20 mile route to the hospital, it will take half an hour, or 30 minutes. The helicopter takes three minutes to take off, three minutes to land, and 15 minutes to travel to the hospital, for a total of 21 minutes. Therefore, it takes the helicopter $30 - 21 = \boxed{9}$ fewer minutes to complete its trip.

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $\angle CAB=30^\circ$ and since the exterior angle at $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, \[\angle ABC=180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ.\]Angle $x$ and $\angle{BCA}$ are vertical angles and their measures are therefore equal. So, it suffices to find the measure of $\angle{BCA}$.

The angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, so  \[\angle BCA=180^\circ-30^\circ-90^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]

The perfect squares from 100 and 200 (inclusive) are 100, 121, 144, 169, and 196.  The numbers that are 1 or 2 larger than those perfect squares are as follows:

101, 102, 122, 123, 145, 146, 170, 171, 197, and 198.

Clearly, no even number greater than 2 can be a prime number, so we narrow our field down to 101, 123, 145, 171, and 197.

Testing, we see that 101 is prime, 123 is not (3 times 41), 145 is not (5 times 29), 171 is not (9 times 19), and 197 is prime.  Hence, the sum of the primes that fit the problem is $101+197= \boxed{298}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Solution: It can be seen that $m\angle B = 180^\circ - m\angle A - m\angle C = 105^\circ$. Now, we apply the law of sines to $\triangle ABC$. \[\frac{BC}{\sin{30^\circ}}=\frac{AB}{\sin{105^\circ}},\] and therefore \[BC=AB\cdot\frac{\sin{30^\circ}}{\sin{105^\circ}}=20\cdot\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\frac{20\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{2}}=10 \cdot \left(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}\right).\] Thus, the answer is $\boxed{10 \cdot \left(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}\right)}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the first 13 numbers `cycle`. After the completion of cycle, John has two smaller cycles, `cycle-1` and `cycle-2`, the first of which counts up to $1$ less than the top integer of `cycle`, and the second of which counts back down to 1. These two smaller cycles each have $\text{cycle}-1$ integers.

Therefore, there are $\text{cycle} + 2(\text{cycle}-1) = 3\text{cycle} - 2$ total numbers that John has counted up to or down to. To find the number corresponding to a particular position, $n$, we have to determine how many complete cycles it falls within, i.e., if $n=1$ to $3\text{cycle} - 2$, we know it falls within the first complete cycle (and therefore corresponds to one of the first $13$ numbers), and so on.

For example, suppose we wanted to find the 25th number in John's list with one cycle (i.e., up to $13$ and back down). Since there are $11$ numbers in the two smaller cycles, we know it falls within the first cycle. To find its exact position, note that in one cycle, the list counts up to $13$ and then back down to $1$. Therefore, the $13^{\text{th}}$ number in the sequence is $1$, the $12^{\text{th}}$ is $2$, and so on. The $25^{\text{th}}$ number will be $25 - 13 = 12$ numbers after the last $13$, which is $\boxed{2}$.

For the $5000^{\text{th}}$ number, the first $3\cdot 13 - 2 = 37$ elements are covered by the first 3 cycles, so we are looking for the $(5000-37)$th number of a cycle. This is the $(fn)th$ number in a cycle, where $13+f\times 11\geq 5\mathrm{,}000-37>13+(f-1)\times 11$. 

Thus $13+11\times 448=4921\ge5000-37$, and $13+11\times 459=5062>5000-37$. Therefore, the $5\mathrm{,}000$th integer is flipping the $448\mathrm{th}$ and $449\mathrm{th}$ integer of a cycle, which is $13-1-\boxed{447}=11{,}452-447=\boxed{11{,}005}$

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\frac35\cdot 30 = 18^\circ$ past hour 9, which means it is $30^\circ - 18^\circ = 12^\circ$ shy of hour 10.  This means the minute hand is $2\cdot 30^\circ + 12^\circ = 72^\circ$ shy of hour 12.

The hour hand is $\frac{48}{60} = \frac45$ of the way from hour 2 to hour 3, so it is $\frac45\cdot 30^\circ = 24^\circ$ past hour 2.  So, the hour hand is $2\cdot 30^\circ + 24^\circ = 84^\circ$ past hour 12.

Combining the angles between each hand and hour 12, the angle between the hands is $72^\circ + 84^\circ = \boxed{156^\circ}$.

Each digit to the right of the vertical bar represents (the units digit of) one exam grade. Counting the digits, we see that there are $27$ exam grades in all. Thus, the $14^{\rm th}$ grade in increasing order is the median (since there are $13$ grades smaller than it and $13$ grades larger than it). The chart makes it easy to read off the grades in increasing order -- we just read across the rows, from top to bottom. The $14^{\rm th}$ entry is $78,$ so that's the median grade.

The mode is the most frequently occurring grade. In this case, it's $86,$ which appears four times in the chart.

The arithmetic mean of the median and mode of the data is $\dfrac{1}{2}(78+86),$ or $\boxed{82}.$

As is often the case, calculating $2^{20}$ by brute force is not practical.  Instead, we will try simplifying the expression and combining some terms.  First, note that $2^{21} = 2 \cdot 2^{20}$, because of the definition of an exponent.  So, we can rewrite the expression as $(2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2 \cdot 2^{20}) \div 2^{17} = 5 \cdot 2^{20} \div 2^{17}$.

Clearly the long light and dark gray strips along the four sides are identical, so they have the same area.  The only leftover dark gray pieces are the four $1\,\mathrm{in}\times 2\,\mathrm{in}$ pieces in the corners.  In other words, the dark gray part of the frame is 8 square inches greater than the light gray region, which means that it has an area of $\boxed{108}~\text{in}^2$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\circ$.

To see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\circ$.

Answer from Original: 8

GPT File: 4-7-MATH-test-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1251_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
For an n sided convex polygon, the sum of the interior angles is $(n-2) \times 180$. 

Let $x$ be the missing interior angle in the polygon. Then we can set up the following equation:

$(n - 2) \times 180 - x = 1070$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$

$(n - 2) \times 180 = x + 1070$


Thus, we can solve for $n$:

$(n-2) \times 180 - x = 1070$

$(n-2) \times 180 - (180 - x) = 1070$

$(n-2) \times 180 + x - 180 = 1070$

$(n-2) \times 180 + x = 1250$

$n-2 = \frac{1250-x}{180}$

$n = \frac{1250-x}{180} + 2$

Therefore, for any value of $x$ we have a corresponding value of $n$. However, we know that for a polygon to be convex, each interior angle must be less than $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, the missing angle must be greater than $180^{\circ}$. 

The possible options for $x$ are:

- $x = 181^{\circ}$, which gives $n = 8$
- $x = 182^{\circ}$, which gives $n = 9$
- $x = 183^{\circ}$, which gives $n = 10$
- $x = 184^{\circ}$, which gives $n = 11$
- $x = 185^{\circ}$, which gives $n = 12$

Therefore, the polygon could have 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 sides.

Extracting Answer from: 
We have  \[
14\text{ days} = 1 \text{ fortnight}
\] and \[
8\text{ furlongs} = 1\text{ mile},
\] and we are asked to convert a quantity whose units are furlongs per fortnight to miles per day.  We divide the first equation by 14 days to obtain a quantity which is equal to 1 and has units of fortnight in the numerator. \[
1=\frac{1\text{ fortnight}}{14\text{ days}}.
\] Similarly, \[
1=\frac{1\text{ mile}}{8\text{ furlongs}}.
\] Since the right-hand sides of both of these equations are equal to 1, we may multiply them by 2800 furlongs per fortnight to change the units without changing the value of the expression: \[
2800\frac{\text{furlongs}}{\text{fortnight}}\cdot\left(\frac{1\text{ fortnight}}{14\text{ days}}\right)\left(\frac{1\text{ mile}}{8\text{ furlongs}}\right)=\boxed{25}\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{day}}.

Since $AP = BP$, right triangle $APB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $AB = AP\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$ and $\angle ABP = 45^\circ$, so $\angle DBC = 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$, which means $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle as well.  Since $P$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$, we have $BD = 2BP = 8$ and $PD = BP = 4$.  Since $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, we have $CD = BD = 8$ and $BC =CD\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.

Each of $\triangle PSQ$ and $\triangle RSQ$ is right-angled at $S$, so we can use the Pythagorean Theorem in both triangles.

In $\triangle RSQ$, we have $QS^2 = QR^2 - SR^2 = 25^2-20^2=625 - 400 = 225$, so $QS=\sqrt{225}=15$ since $QS>0$.

In $\triangle PSQ$, we have $PQ^2 = PS^2 + QS^2 = 8^2 + 225 = 64+225=289$, so $PQ = \sqrt{289}=17$ since $PQ>0$.

We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BD=DC$. From $\triangle ABD$, we get $25^2-AD^2=BD^2$. From $\triangle ADC$, we get $25^2-AD^2=DC^2$. Since $BD=DC$, we have $25^2-AD^2=BD^2=DC^2$. Thus, $2\cdot25^2-2AD^2=BC^2$. 

Then, since $BC=14$, we have $2\cdot25^2-2AD^2=14^2$, which implies $AD^2=\boxed{576}$.

The positive multiples of $17$ that are less than $50$ are $17$ and $34$. There are not any more since $17 \cdot 3 = 51$, and $51$ is not less than $50$. Then we know that the negative multiples of $17$ that are greater than $-50$ are $-17$ and $-34$. We still have to think about whether $0$ is a multiple of $17$ or not, and it is since $0 = 0 \cdot 17$ (or because of the more general rule that $0$ is a multiple of every integer).

So there are $\boxed{5}$ multiples of $17$ that are greater than $-50$ and less than $50$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Writing out the prime factors of $22$ and $48$, we see that $22 = 2 \cdot 11$ and $48 = 16 \cdot 3 = 2^4 \cdot 3$. Since $11$ does not divide $48$ and $3$ does not divide $22$, it follows that the greatest common factor of $22$ and $48$ is $2$.

The least common multiple, on the other hand, must account for the prime factors of both $22$ and $48$. The highest power of $2$ present in either term is $2^4 = 16$, of $3$ is $3^1 = 3$, and of $11$ is $11^1 = 11$. Thus, the LCM will be $2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 11 = 528$. The product of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple is thus $2 \cdot 528 = \boxed{1056}$.

The diagonals of a rhombus divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, the legs of which are half-diagonals of the rhombus.  Let $a$ and $b$ be the half-diagonal lengths of the rhombus.  The area of the rhombus is 4 times the area of one of the right triangles, in other words $4\times\frac{1}{2}ab=2ab$.  Since $a=5$ units and the area of the rhombus is $120$ square units, we find $b=120/(2\cdot5)=12$ units.  The perimeter is 4 times the hypotenuse of one of the right triangles: \[

You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10=2\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.

Every time a number is a multiple of $5$, it adds a factor of $5$ to the prime factorization. There are $8$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $42$. Now look at $25$. It actually has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them, so now we need to count one more. This gives a total of $8+1=9$ times the factor $5$ appears, so $42!$ has $\boxed{9}$ zeroes at the end.

The angle marked $143^\circ$ and angle $CBD$ are corresponding angles and therefore have equal measures.  It follows that $143^\circ$ and $5x-8^\circ$ sum to 180 degrees.  Solving  \[
143+(5x-8)=180,
\] we find $x=\boxed{9}$.

A pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it if it is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10. Thus, we must first find the LCM of 4, 6, and 10. $4=2^2$, $6=2\cdot3$, and $10=2\cdot5$. For a number to be a multiple of all three of these numbers, it prime factorization must have a 2 raised to at least the second power, a 3 raised to at least the first power, and a 5 raised to at least the first power. Thus, the least common multiple is $2^2\cdot3\cdot5=60$. Thus, every 60th pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it. Because there are 600 total pots, the number of pots with 3 different colored balloons on it is $600 \div 60=\boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $S$ be the sum of all of Brian's test scores up to this point, and let $n$ be the number of tests Brian has taken up to this point. Thus the arithmetic mean of his scores now is $\frac{S}{n}$ and the arithmetic mean of his scores after getting a 98 on the last test will be $\frac{S+98}{n+1}$. This gives the system of equations: \begin{align*}
\frac{S}{n} &= 91 & \frac{S+98}{n+1} & = 92
\end{align*} From the first equation we have $S = 91n$. Substituting this into the second equation gives: \begin{align*}
\frac{S+98}{n+1} &= 92\\
S+98 &= 92(n+1)\\
91n+98 &= 92n+92\\
92n-91n&= 98-92\\
n&= 6

Recalling that "as much" means "times" here and "half" means "1/2," we see that Stacy wants to use $\frac{1}{2}\times 3\frac{4}{5}$ cups of flour. To multiply, we first convert $3\frac45$ to a fraction:  \[
3\frac{4}{5} = 3 + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{3\cdot 5}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{15}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{19}{5}.
\]Now we multiply by 1/2:  \[
\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \frac45 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{19}{5} = \frac{1\cdot 19}{2\cdot 5} = \frac{19}{10}.
\]Finally, we convert 19/10 to a mixed number. When we divide 19 by 10, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 9. So \[
\frac{19}{10} = \frac{10+9}{10} = \frac{10}{10}+ \frac{9}{10} = 1 + \frac{9}{10} = \boxed{1\frac{9}{10}}.

The mean of the set is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of numbers (which is 3), so the mean is $\frac{6+x+22}{3}$.  The median of the set is the number in the middle when the numbers are written in increasing order, so the median of this set is $x.$  Thus, we have \[\frac{6+x+22}{3} = x.\]  Multiplying both sides by 3 yields $6+x+22 = 3x$, which simplifies to $28 = 2x$ or $x=\boxed{14}$.

The number 1 to any power is always 1, so no matter how many times Hypatia and Euclid cube their numbers, they will both always have the number 1. Thus, Hypatia and Euclid both write down the number 1.


Now, lets take a look at Pythagoras. He keeps cubing his result 20 times starting with the number 2. The numbers he has are \begin{align*}
2^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}8 \\
8^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}512 \\
512^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}134217728 \\
\vdots
\end{align*}We can see that these numbers get out of hand pretty quickly (no wonder it took them so long), so instead, we look at the sum of the results because that is what we are trying to find. Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$. Because the number Ptolemy chose is the negation of what Pythagoras chose, after a certain number of cubes, whatever Pythagoras has, Ptolemy will have the opposite of that. Thus, whatever gigantic number Pythagoras has at the end of the game, Ptolemy will have the negation of that number, and they will add to zero.

Thus, our desired sum is  \begin{align*}1+1&+(\text{some huge number}) + (-\text{the same huge number})\\
&=1+1+0=\boxed{2}.

Let the length of the height of trapezoid $ABCD$ be $h$; note that this is also the length of the height of triangle $ACB$ to base $AB$.  Then the area of $ABCD$ is $\frac{20 + 12}{2}\cdot h = 16h$.  On the other hand, the area of triangle $ACB$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 20\cdot h = 10h$.  Thus the desired ratio is $\frac{10}{16} = \boxed{\frac{5}{8}}$.

First, we simplify the first part of the expression by using a common denominator of $3$. \begin{align*}\left(2-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right)&=\left(2\cdot \frac{3}{3}-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{6-4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right).\end{align*}Next we simplify the second part of the expression by using a common denominator of $4$: \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right)&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{2-3}{4}\right)\\
&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)\\
&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right).
\end{align*}Finally, we can subtract the two fractions using a common denominator of $12$. \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{4}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{3}{3}\right)\\

[/asy]

Both right triangles are 30-60-90 triangles. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg in each triangle is half the hypotenuse, and the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.  We apply these facts to each triangle, starting with $\triangle AOB$ and working clockwise.

From $\triangle AOB$, we find $AB = AO/2 = 8$ and $BO = AB\sqrt{3}=8\sqrt{3}$.

From $\triangle BOC$, we find $BC = BO/2 =4\sqrt{3}$ and $CO = BC\sqrt{3} =4\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \boxed{12}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the mean of the heights of the 5 tallest buildings in Los Angeles before the new building was built was 733, the sum of their heights must have been $5\cdot733 = 3665$. After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller. Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\boxed{52}$ feet. Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that $-(x+y)=-x-y$ for all $x$ and $y$. Thus,  $$317^{3}+8^{3}-(2^{(3^{2})}+317^{3})=317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}.$$ Using the commutative property of addition, we can rearrange the terms to get  \begin{align*}
317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}&=317^{3}+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})+(-317^{3})\\
&=317^{3}+(-317^{3})+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})\\
&=8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})
\end{align*} Since a number and its negation sum to $0$, we are left with $8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})$. Because $8=2^3$, we get $$8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})=(2^{3})^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})}).$$ From the properties of exponents, we know that $(a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}$ so $(2^{3})^{3}=2^9$.  We then have  $$(2^{3})^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})=2^9+(-2^9)$$ Because a number and its negation sum to $0$, we get that $2^9+(-2^9)=\boxed{0}$.

Stripped String: 
Recallthat$-(x+y)=-x-y$forall$x$and$y$.Thus,$$317^{3}+8^{3}-(2^{(3^{2})}+317^{3})=317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}.$$Usingthecommutativepropertyofaddition,wecanrearrangethetermstoget\begin{align*}317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}&=317^{3}+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})+(-317^{3})\&=317^{3}+(-317^{3})+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})\&=8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})\end{align*}Sinceanumberanditsnegationsumto$0$,weareleftwith$8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})$.Because$8=2^3$,weget$$8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})=(2^{3})^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})}).$$Fromthepropertiesofexponents,weknowthat$(a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}$so$(2^{3})^{3}=2^9$.Wethenhave$$(2^{3})^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})=2^9+(-2^9)$$Becauseanumberanditsnegationsumto$0$,wegetthat$2^9+(-2^9)=\boxed{0}$.

Based on the histogram, we can make an educated guess that the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast will be around $2$ or $3$ (simply because there are a large number of years for which no hurricanes or only one hurricane reached the east coast). To this end, we begin by calculating the number of years in which three to seven hurricanes reached the east coast: $12 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 21$. There are $5 + 14 = 19$ years in which zero or one hurricanes reached the east coast. Thus, the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast is $\boxed{2}$.

We obtain fractions equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}$ by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.

The sum of the numerator and denominator of $\frac{5}{8}$ is $13,$ so when we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number, the sum of the numerator and denominator is also multiplied by this same number.

Since $91 = 13 \times 7,$ then we should multiply the numerator and denominator both by $7$ to get a fraction $$\frac{5\times 7}{8 \times 7} = \frac{35}{56}$$equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}$ whose numerator and denominator add up to $91.$

The legs of the right triangle are in a $3:4$ ratio, so the right triangle is similar to a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle and thus it has hypotenuse $5\cdot 5 = 25$.  The perimeter of the right triangle is then $15 + 20 + 25 = 60$.  Then the square has side length $60/4=15$ and area $15^2 = \boxed{225}$ square inches.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can create a Venn diagram with circles labeled "Black Fur" and "Catches Mice". We want to find the smallest number of cats that are black but do not catch mice, so we will label this part of our Venn diagram $x$. We will also let $y$ represent the number of cats with black fur that also catch mice, and $z$ represent the number of cats that do not have black fur but do catch mice.

label("${\bf y}$",(5.5,4));
label("${\bf z}$",(8.3,4));
label("${\bf x}$",(2.7,4));
[/asy]

We know that there are 17 cats that don't catch mice, so there are 24-17=7 cats that do catch mice. This tells us that $y+z=7.$ There are 10 cats with black fur, so $x+y=10$. The value of $x$ will be as small as possible when the value of $y$ is as large as possible. The largest value $y$ can be is $7$, since $y+z=7$. If $y=7$, then $x$ must equal $3$.

First let's calculate $a$. The sum of the numbers is $13+14+22+52+63+74=238$. $238$ rounded to the nearest ten gives us $a=240$.

Now let's calculate $b$. Rounding $13, 14, 22, 52, 63, 74$ each to the nearest ten, we get $10, 10, 20, 50, 60, 70$ respectively. This means that $b=10+10+20+50+60+70=220$. Therefore,  $$a-b=240-220=\boxed{20}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
70. The sum of these numbers is 238, which rounds to 240. To round to the nearest ten, the last digit of 240 must be either 0 or 5; since it is closer to 0, we round down to 240. We can first round each of the numbers to the nearest ten to obtain 10, 10, 20, 50, 60, and 70, which sum to 220. Therefore, $a-b = 240-220 = 20$.

Case 2: 2 digits

We have the following combinations of numbers: 13, 16, 17, 36, 37, 67, 76, 73, 63, 71, 61, 31.  Out of these 12 numbers, it is easier to count the composites: 16, 36, 76, and 63 for a total of 4 composites, which we subtract from the original 12 numbers to yield $12-4=8$ primes in this case.

First consider the two $3$s to appear in the units and tens places. Between $100$ and $500$, there are four such numbers: $133$, $233$, $333$, and $433$. Now consider the two $3$s to appear in the units and hundreds places. The numbers will be in the $300$s, so we don't need to worry about if they are between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the tens digit, but we have already counted $333$, so such a scenario will add nine numbers. Finally, consider the two $3$s to appear in the tens and hundreds places. Again, these numbers are automatically between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the units digit, but we again discard $333$ for a final count of nine such numbers. Thus, our answer is $4+9+9 = \boxed{22}$.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is $180(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. That means each interior angle has a measure of $\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees. We set this equal to 170 degrees and solve for $n$. \begin{align*}
\frac{180(n-2)}{n}&=170\\
\Rightarrow \qquad 180n-360&=170n\\\Rightarrow \qquad 10n&=360\\

Extracting Answer from: 
The ratio of the radius of the smaller circle to that of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{2}$, since the diameter is half as long.  Thus, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to that of the larger circle is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.  Thus, the gray area is $\boxed{25\%}$ of the area of the larger circle.

To be more rigorous: if the radius of the larger circle is $r$, the radius of the smaller circle is $\frac{1}{2} r$.  Thus, the ratio of the area of the smaller to the larger is: $\frac{\pi (\frac{1}{2} r)^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{1}{4}$.

Recall that if $b$ is nonzero and $n$ is a positive integer, then $$\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n}=\frac{a^n}{b^n}.$$For this problem we have $$\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{3}=\frac{5^3}{7^3}\cdot \frac{4^3}{5^3}=\frac{5^3\cdot 4^3}{7^3\cdot 5^3}.$$We can simplify because there is a factor of $5^3$ in the numerator and the denominator.  To do this we use the commutative property of multiplication and use the multiplication rule in reverse as follows $$\frac{5^3\cdot 4^3}{7^3\cdot 5^3}=\frac{4^3\cdot 5^3}{7^3\cdot 5^3}=\frac{4^3}{7^3}\cdot \frac{5^3}{5^3}=\frac{4^3}{7^3}\cdot 1=\frac{4^3}{7^3}=\boxed{\frac{64}{343}}.$$We also might have noted that \[\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^{3}\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^{3}=\left(\frac57\cdot \frac45\right)^3 = \left(\frac47\right)^3 = \frac{4^3}{7^3} = \boxed{\frac{64}{343}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we want to find the relationship between pandas and alpacas. Substituting ``='' for ``as cool as,'' we know that 3 pandas = 7 cats and 2 cats = 5 alpacas. Noting that the lowest common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14, we can multiply the panda-cat equality by 2 to learn that 6 pandas = 14 cats and multiply the cat-alpaca equality by 7 to learn that 14 cats = 35 alpacas. Combining these two equalities, we see that 6 pandas = 35 alpacas. Since $70\div 35 = 2$, we can double the panda-alpaca equation to learn that 12 pandas = 70 alpacas. Therefore, $\boxed{12}$ pandas are as cool as 70 alpacas.

Alternatively, we could set up a string of fractions to ``cancel'' the units: $70\text{ alpacas} \times \frac{2\text{ cats}}{5\text{ alpacas}}\times\frac{3 \text{ pandas}}{7\text{ cats}}=\boxed{12}\text{ pandas}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to find square factors of 2940.  Beginning the search, we can first see it is divisible by 10.  So, $2940=2\cdot5\cdot294$.  Looking at 294, we can see it is divisible by 2 and 3.  Taking out these factors, find that $294=2\cdot3\cdot49$.  Since $49=7^2$, there is a square factor of 2 and a square factor of 7.  The complete factorization is $2940=2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7^2$.  Therefore, $$\sqrt{2940}=\sqrt{2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7^2}=2\sqrt{3\cdot5\cdot7^2}=2\cdot7\sqrt{3\cdot5}=\boxed{14\sqrt{15}}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
A $3$-digit palindrome must be of the form $aba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits, and $a\neq 0$. In order for $aba$ to be divisible by $3$, we require that $a + b + a = 2a + b$ be divisible by $3$. Since $0 < a\leq 9$ and $0 \leq b \leq 9$, the maximum possible value of $2a+b$ is $2\cdot 9 + 9 = 27$.  We will list all of the multiples of $3$ from $0$ through $27$, and determine how many possibilities for $a, b$ make $2a + b$ equal to that multiple.

If $2a + b = 0$, then there are no solutions such that $a \neq 0$.
If $2a+b=3$, then $b=3-2a$, so $a=1$ is the only solution.
If $2a+b=6$, then $b=6-2a$, so $a=1,2,3$, since $a\ge 4$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=9$, then $b=9-2a$, so $a=1,2,3,4$, since $a\ge 5$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=12$, then $b=12-2a$, so $a=2,3,4,5,6$, since $a\le 1$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a\ge 7$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=15$, then $b=15-2a$, so $a=3,4,5,6,7$, since $a\le 2$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a\ge 8$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=18$, then $b=18-2a$, so $a=5,6,7,8,9$, since $a\le 4$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=21$, then $b=21-2a$, so $a=6,7,8,9$, since $a\le 5$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=24$, then $b=24-2a$, so $a=8,9$, since $a\le 7$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=27$, then $b=27-2a$, so $a=9$, since as we've seen $a$ and $b$ must both be as large as possible.

In each case, a value of $a$ uniquely determines a value of $b$, so we haven't missed any palindromes. Thus the total number is $1+3+4+5+5+5+4+2+1=\boxed{30}$.

Since the length and width are whole number values, the dimensions of rectangle $B$ must be $1\times25$ or $5\times5$. Rectangle $B$ shares a sidelength with rectangle $A$ and another sidelength with rectangle $C$, so each sidelength must also be a factor of the other rectangle's area. Since $25$ is not a factor of $40$ or $30$, it cannot be a sidelength of rectangle $B$. That means rectangle $B$ is a $5\times5$ rectangle, which makes the respective dimensions of rectangle $A$ and $C$ $8\times5$ and $5\times 6$.

Hint: What do we know about the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral? 

Solution: 

We can start by using the fact that the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is always equal to $360^\circ$. 

The sum of the first three angles is $21^\circ+66^\circ+134^\circ=221^\circ$. 

Therefore, the measure of the fourth angle is $360^\circ-221^\circ=\boxed{139^\circ}$.

Instead of adding up scores and figuring out the new averages, a quicker way (useful for the countdown round) is as follows:

Since the average is 90, we first calculate how many points below 90 he already is: he's scored 87, 85, and 87, meaning that he is 3, 5, and 3 points below 90 respectively, making for a total of 11 points below.  We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\boxed{97}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that two expressions are equivalent if they are equal for all valid choices of the variable or variables involved.

Question 1:  no, because the given expressions are equal only for certain values of $x$. Almost any $x$ will do: take $x=2$ and note that $\frac{2}{3(2)}=\frac{1}{3}$ while $\frac{2(2)}{3}=\frac{4}{3}$.

Question 2: no, because the second expression is $-1$ times the first expression. Thus they are only equal if each of them happens to equal 0. For example, if $h=3$, then $\frac{1-h}{2h}=\frac{1-3}{2(3)}=\frac{-2}{6}=-\frac{1}{3}$, while $\frac{h-1}{2h} = \frac{3-1}{2(3)} = \frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.

Question 3: yes, because we obtain the second expression by distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in the first expression.

Question 4: no, because the negative sign has not been properly distributed. To confirm that the expressions are not equivalent, we can choose a value like $y=3$ to find that the first expression becomes $-(3+3)=-6$ while the second expression is $-3+3=0$.

Question 5: yes, because we can multiply $\frac{1}{2}$ by $j$ in the usual way by writing $j$ as $\frac{j}{1}$. We get \[
\frac{1}{2}j = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{j}{1} = \frac{1\cdot j}{2\cdot 1} = \frac{j}{2}.
\]

Question 6: yes, by the commutative property of addition.

The questions whose answers are yes are 3, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is $\boxed{14}$.

We want to have the least common denominator, $2 \cdot 3 = 6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions.  We write one half as $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{3}{6}$. Also, we write one third as $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2}{6}.$ Adding these, we obtain $\frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.$$

If the diameter of the circle is $16$, then its radius is $8$. The area of this circle is then $\pi r^2 = \pi (8^2) = 64 \pi$. If we want the area of the new circle to be $48 \pi$ less than the area of this one, then the new circle must have an area of $64 \pi - 48 \pi = 16 \pi$. Now that we know the area of this circle, we can find its radius $R$ by setting $\pi R^2$ equal to $16 \pi$, so we have that $\pi R^2 = 16 \pi$ and $R = 4$.

The radius of the first circle was $8$ and the new radius is $4$, so the radius was decreased by $8-4=\boxed{4}$.

Subtract 3 and divide by 4 on both sides of the first inequality to obtain \begin{align*}
4n + 3 &< 25 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 4n &< 22 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad n &< 5.5.
\end{align*}Similarly, the second inequality yields \begin{align*}
-7n + 5 &< 24 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad -7n &< 19 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad n &> -\frac{19}{7}.
\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive. There are $5$ positive integers, $2$ negative integers, and zero, so there are $\boxed{8}$ integers that satisfy both $4n + 3 < 25$ and $-7n + 5 < 24$.

To find out how many multiples there are that fit this description, first we find all the positive multiples, which are 6, 12, 18, and 24. Since 30 is greater than 25, it doesn't match the description and we now know that there are 4 positive multiples of 6 that are less than 25.

Because the limits for negative multiples are the same as the limits for positive multiples, we can figure out that the only negative multiples that are greater than -25 are -6, -12, -18, and -24.

Four positive multiples, four negative multiples, and zero (because $6 \cdot 0=0$) means that there are $\boxed{9 \text{ multiples}}$ that will work.

- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& n &

The intersection of these lines creates a triangle shown in the figure. Starting from the vertex closest to angle 2 and moving clockwise, label the triangle's vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$. Since $\angle ABC$ is a vertical angle of angle 1, it is equal to 50 degrees. Since $\angle BCA$ is a right angle (the two lines intersecting to form the angle are perpendicular) and since the interior angles in the triangle sum to 180 degrees, $\angle CAB = 180 - 90 - 50 = 40$ degrees. Since angle 2 is supplementary to $\angle CAB$, angle 2 is equal to $180 - 40 = \boxed{140}$ degrees.

The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the decagon's angles is $180(10-2) = 1440$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular pentagon has measure $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

Therefore, the desired difference is $144^\circ - 108^\circ = \boxed{36^\circ}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Raising 42 to powers could get really messy really quickly, so let's avoid substituting immediately, and see if there is a way to simplify the expression first.

Recall that $\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^n=\frac{1}{x^n}$, so we can rewrite $\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^4$ as $\frac{1}{a^4}$. Thus, we have  \[\frac{1}{a^4} \cdot 2 \cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\]Because multiplication is commutative, we can rearrange the terms to get  \[2 \cdot \frac{1}{a^4} \cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\]Any nonzero number times its reciprocal is 1, so this can be simplified to \[2 \cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3}.\]Simplifying the numbers in the exponent of $a$, we find that it simplifies to $a^0$. Because any number to the zero power is 1, this simplifies to 1. Thus, we have \begin{align*}
2 \cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3} &=2 + a^0 \\
&=2+1 \\
&=\boxed{3}.
\end{align*}

In order for $N$ to be divisible by 12, $N$ must be divisible by $4$ and $3$. That means the last two digits $AB$ must form a multiple of $4.$ Since $A$ and $B$ are nonzero digits, the smallest possible $14{,}9AB$ that is divisible by 4 is $14{,}912.$ Unfortunately, this number is not a multiple of $3$, since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 17.$ However, our next possibility, $14{,}916,$ is a multiple of $3,$ since $1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 6 = 21.$ Therefore, $\boxed{14{,}916}$ is our answer.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$. The pentagon has 5 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is $180\cdot3$. We subtract the degree measures of the two right angles to get $180\cdot3-90-90=180\cdot2$, which is the sum of the measures of the three congruent interior angles. We divide by 3 to get the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles: $\frac{180\cdot2}{3}=60\cdot2=\boxed{120^\circ}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
A convex pentagon has five sides. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) times 180 degrees, which is 540 degrees. Two interior angles of a convex pentagon are right angles, each of which measures 90 degrees. Substituting these known values into the equation for the sum of interior angles of a pentagon and solving for x, we have: 

90 + 90 + 3x = 540

Solving for x, 

3x = 360 

x = 120

Therefore, the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles is 120 degrees.

The total amount eaten is $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{5}$. The denominators have a common multiple of 35, so this is equivalent to $\frac{10}{35} + \frac{21}{35} = \frac{10 + 21}{35} = \frac{31}{35}$. Thus, the amount that Chris and Nathan didn't eat is $1 - \frac{31}{35} = \frac{35}{35} - \frac{31}{35} = \boxed{\frac{4}{35}}.$

The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with 7 angles is $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees. Therefore, we must have \[x + x + (x-2) + (x-2) + (x+2) + (x+2) + (x+4) = 900.\] Simplifying the left side gives $7x + 4 = 900$, so $7x = 896$ and $x = 128$.  Therefore, the measure of the largest interior angle is $x + 4 = \boxed{132}$ degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
Remember, even powers of $-1$ equal $1$, and odd powers of $-1$ equal $-1$.  Therefore, $x + x^2 = -1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  The next pair cancels out in the same way: $x^3 + x^4 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^4 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  Now, it is easy to see that the pattern continues for every pair of powers, all the way up to $x^{2009} + x^{2010}$.  Notice that $x^{2011}$ is the only power that hasn't been canceled out.  Therefore, the answer is $(-1)^{2011} = \boxed{-1}.$

The exponent of $109$ in the prime factorization of $x^{11}$ is $11 \cdot 5 = 55$. 

Using the rule $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$, we see that $x = 107 \cdot 109^5$ has prime factorization $x = 107^1 \cdot 109^5$. Therefore, $x^{11} = (107^1 \cdot 109^5)^{11} = 107^{11} \cdot (109^5)^{11}$. The exponent of $109$ in this prime factorization is $11 \cdot 5 = 55$.

We need to find $\frac{15}{8}$ of $\frac{2}{5}.$ Since the word "of" means multiply, we need to find the product of these two fractions, $\frac{15}{8} \cdot \frac{2}{5}.$ This equals $\frac{15 \cdot 2}{8 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}$. Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\frac{3 \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{2}}{\cancel{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cancel{5}} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\boxed{20}$ percent.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that $\left(a^m\right)^n=a^{mn}$. Because of this, the second number is $\left(2^2\right)^3=2^{2\cdot 3}=2^6$. Because the exponents in the first number are in parentheses, we must complete that exponentiation first. $2^3=8$, so the first number is $2^{(2^3)}=2^8$. Thus, we have  \[2^8-2^6.\] Evaluating these exponents and subtracting, we get $256-64=\boxed{192}$.

We can compare numbers in decimal form digit-by-digit, starting with the largest digit. The ones digits of the four numbers are  \begin{tabular}{cc}
number & ones digit \\ \hline
0.78 & 0 \\
0.12 & 0 \\
1.33 & 1 \\
1.328 & 1
\end{tabular}Since $1$ is bigger than $0,$ this tells us that each of the first two numbers is smaller than each of the second two numbers. Continuing to compare $1.33$ and $1.328,$ we go to the next digit. The tenths digit of each number is $3,$ so we have to go to the next digit. The hundredths digit of $1.33$ is $3,$ while the hundredths digit of $1.328$ is $2.$ Since $3$ is bigger than $2,$ we conclude that $1.33$ is bigger than $1.328.$

Comparing the two numbers that are less than $1,$ we see that the tenths digit of $0.12$ is smaller than the tenths digit of $0.78.$ So, $0.12$ is the smallest of these four numbers.

Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list is $1.33 - 0.12 = \boxed{1.21}.$

The first piece can go in any of the $64$ squares.

This would seem to give us $64\cdot 14$ choices for the placement of the two pieces.

If the measure of $\angle TSQ$ is $145^{\circ}$, then the measure of $\angle TSP$ is $180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^{\circ}$ since they are supplementary angles. The measure of $\angle RQP$ is also $35^{\circ}$ since sides $TS$ and $RQ$ are parallel. Now we have two of the three angles in triangle $PQR$. To find the third, we calculate $180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - 35^{\circ} = 80^{\circ}$. The measure of $\angle PRQ$ is $\boxed{80^{\circ}}$.

Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since $\frac13$ of the cars are red, there are $\frac13\cdot 30 = 10$ red cars, so there are $10 -x$ red 2-door cars.  There are $(50\%)\cdot 30 = (0.5)(30) = 15$ cars that are 4-door cars, so $15-x$ of the 4-door cars are not red.  We then have the following Venn diagram:

[asy]
unitsize(0.05cm);
label("Red cars", (2,74));
label("4-door cars", (80,74));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));

label(scale(0.8)*"$10-x$",(28,58));
label(scale(0.8)*"$15-x$",(63,58));

Extracting Answer from: 
The easiest approach is to consider how many times $6$ can appear in the units place and how many times in the tens place. If we put a $6$ in the units place, there are $10$ choices for the tens place. Likewise, if we put a $6$ in the tens place, there are $10$ choices for the units place. So, there are $\boxed{20}$ appearances of the digit $6.$

Note: Read the question carefully. There are $19$ numbers that include $6,$ but $6$ appears $20$ times. Always answer the question that is asked.

The product of four positive integers is prime only if three of the integers are 1 and the fourth is a prime number.  Therefore, of the $6^4$ outcomes for the roll of four dice, only the outcomes $(1,1,1,p)$, $(1,1,p,1)$, $(1,p,1,1)$, and $(p,1,1,1)$ for $p=2$, $3$, or $5$ give a prime product.  The probability of achieving a prime product is therefore \[

Perimeter of a regular hexagon is equal to 6 times the length of one side. 

The perimeter of one of the equilateral triangles is 21 inches.

Therefore, the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is (21 / 3) = 7 inches. 

The length of one side of the hexagon is equal to the length of the side of the equilateral triangle. 

So, the perimeter of the hexagon is 6 * 7 = 42 inches. 

Hence, the perimeter of the regular hexagon is 42 inches.

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DB=DC = DA = 4\sqrt{2}$, so $BC = BD+DC = 8\sqrt{2}$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(4\sqrt{2})(8\sqrt{2})}{2} = \boxed{32}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Triangle $AFD$ must have a total angle measure of $180^\circ$. We know that the other two angles have measures of $2x$ and $2y$, so angle $AFD$ must have a measure of $180-2x-2y=180-(2x+2y)$ degrees. We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Recall that if $b$ and $d$ are nonzero, then  $$\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d}=\frac{a\cdot c}{b\cdot d}.$$That is, to multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.  The product of the given numerators is $-5\cdot 8=-40$.  The product of the denominators is $9\cdot 17=153$.  So,  $$\frac{-5}{9}\cdot \frac{8}{17}=\frac{-5\cdot 8}{9\cdot 17}=\frac{-40}{153}=\boxed{-\frac{40}{153}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the number of pennies that Betty has be $n.$ If after adding two more pennies, Betty can only arrange the pennies in a straight line, then $n+2$ must be prime. Since all primes greater than $2$ are odd, $n$ must be odd as well. Because she can arrange $n$ pennies in three different ways, $n$ must have four factors other than $1$ and itself. Hence we examine the odd numbers between $40$ and $50:$

$\bullet$ $41$ factors as $1 \cdot 41$ only.

$\bullet$ $43$ factors as $1 \cdot 43$ only.

$\bullet$ $45$ factors as $1 \cdot 45$ or $3 \cdot 15$ or $5 \cdot 9$.

$\bullet$ $47$ factors as $1 \cdot 47$ only.

$\bullet$ $49$ factors as $1 \cdot 49$ or $7 \cdot 7$.

The only number with four factors other than $1$ or itself is $45.$ If we add $2$ to $45,$ we get $47,$ which is indeed prime. Hence, Betty has $\boxed{45}$ pennies.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $144^\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $144n$.  Therefore, we must have  \[180(n-2) = 144n.\]Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 144n$, so $36n = 360$ and $n = \boxed{10}$.

We might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\circ - 144^\circ = 36^\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\circ$, so there must be $\frac{360^\circ}{36^\circ} = 10$ of them in the polygon.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will find the positive divisors of 14 by finding pairs that multiply to 14.   We begin our list as follows, $$1 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 14.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\cdot 7=14$, so our list becomes $$1 \quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 7 \quad 14.$$  Checking $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$, we find that none of these are divisors of $14$, so our final list is $$1 \quad 2 \quad 7 \quad 14.$$  Next, we use the buddy method to determine the factors of $42$.  We begin our list as follows, $$1\quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 42.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\cdot 21=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Checking $3$, we find that $3\cdot 14=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Checking $4$ and $5$ we find that $4$ and $5$ are not divisors of $42$.  Checking $6$, we find that $6\cdot 7=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 6 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 7 \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Since $7$ is already on our list, our final list is $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 6 \quad 7 \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  We compare our lists for the factors of $14$ and the factors of $42$ to see that the factors that $14$ and $42$ share are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $14$.  Therefore, Rick and Steve could be thinking of $\boxed{4}$ possible numbers.  Note that since $14$ is a factor of $42$, all of the factors of $14$ are also factors of $42$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$\textbf{Solution:}$ 

Juan paid $6$ cents each for Brazilian and French stamps, $4$ cents each for Peruvian stamps, and $5$ cents each for Spanish stamps. Thus

\begin{align*}
\text{Total Value of Brazilian Stamps} &= 6\text{ cents each}\times 4\text{ stamps} = 24\text{ cents}\\
\text{Total Value of French Stamps} &= 6\text{ cents each}\times 4\text{ stamps} = 24\text{ cents}\\
\text{Total Value of Peruvian Stamps} &= 4\text{ cents each}\times 15\text{ stamps} = 60\text{ cents}\\
\text{Total Value of Spanish Stamps} &= 5\text{ cents each}\times 31\text{ stamps} = 155\text{ cents} = \$1.55
\end{align*}

Thus the grand total value of Juan's collection is $24\text{ cents}+24\text{ cents}+60\text{ cents}+\$1.55=\$2.63$. 

The table below shows the numbers of Juan's stamps by country and by decade. \\

Of Juan's $15$ Spanish stamps issued in the $80\text{'s},$ $9$ are European stamps $(9/15 = 60\%)$. Therefore $\boxed{9}$ is the answer. 

Note: Instead of computing the number of European stamps issued in the 1980s ($141/5=28.2$ stamps) and estimating the number that were Spanish ($28.2/3=9.4$), it was more efficient just to compute the requested percentage.

Extracting Answer from: 
The trick to convert repeating decimals to fractions always involves recognizing the pattern of the repeating decimal and using it to your advantage. In this case, we can recognize that multiplying $1.\overline{234}$ by $1000$ gives $1234.\overline{234}$, a decimal with the exact same repeating portion. Thus, \[
(1000-1) \cdot 1.\overline{234} = 1000 \cdot 1.\overline{234} - 1.\overline{234} = 1234.\overline{234} - 1.\overline{234}
\]\[
\Rightarrow 999 \cdot 1.\overline{234} = 1233
\]\[
\Rightarrow 1.\overline{234} = \frac{1233}{999} = \frac{137 \cdot 9}{111 \cdot 9} = \boxed{\frac{137}{111}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
The probability of rolling "doubles" is 1/6, because there are six possible outcomes for the first die, and for each of those outcomes, there is only one outcome for the second die that will result in doubles. Therefore, there are six possible doubles outcomes out of 36 total outcomes, resulting in a probability of 1/6.

We can count the total number of handshakes by counting the lawyers shaking hands with each of the politicians and then the politicians shaking hands among themselves.

If each lawyer shakes hands with each of the politicians, then each lawyer shakes hands with four people. Since there are three lawyers, $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ handshakes occur.

If each politician shakes hands with each of the other politicians, the first shakes hands with three others, the second shakes hands with two others (not counting the handshake with the first that has already transpired), and the last two each shake the hand of the other. Thus, there are $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$ handshakes that occur.

So, $12 + 6 = \boxed{18}$ total handshakes take place.

First, we would like to determine if 49 can be written as the sum of two perfect squares.

$49 - 1 = 48$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 4 = 45$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 9 = 40$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 16 = 33$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 25 = 24$, which is not a perfect square.

We don't need to check any other squares, as $25 > \frac{49}{2}$.

Now, we check to see if there are three perfect squares that sum to 49. With a little work, we see that $49 = 4 + 9 + 36$. Thus, the fewest number of perfect square terms that can be added together to sum to 49 is $\boxed{3}$.

Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\boxed{-9}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Because the number goes to the ten-thousandths place, and that is where Irene rounds to, Irene will end up with the given number. Since we are looking for the largest number in the group, anyone who ends up rounding down is not the winner because Irene has a number greater than them. Thus, we can ignore all people who end up rounding down.

When we round a number, we look to the digit to the right. If the digit is less than 5, we round down. Thus, if we round by looking at the 2, 3, or 4, we will round down. Thus, Alice, Bob, and Carol will round down, so they are not the winner. Devon will round to the nearest ten. Because 5.6789 is greater than 5, Devon will round up to 12350.

When we round up, the most we can increase the number by is by increasing the decimal place we are rounding to by 1. For example, if we are rounding to the tenths place, the most change that the tenths place can undergo is increasing by 1. We cannot increase it by 2 through rounding. Thus, when Eugene rounds to the nearest one, the highest the ones place could be is a 6, and the tens place will still be a 4. Thus, Eugene's number is smaller than Devon's. Likewise, all of the other people will round their numbers up by less than Devon has, so $\boxed{\text{Devon}}$ is the winner.

Convert both decimals into fractions. \begin{align*}

\Rightarrow x &= \frac{2}{9}.
\end{align*}Likewise, $.\overline{6}=\frac{6}{9}$. Adding the two fractions yields $\frac{2}{9} + \frac{6}{9}=\frac{8}{9}$. The reciprocal of this is $\frac{1}{\frac{8}{9}}=\frac{9}{8}$. To convert this to a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 125. Doing so, we get \[\frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{125}{125} = \frac{9 \cdot 125}{8 \cdot 125} = \frac{1125}{1000}=\boxed{1.125}.\]

Let $y$ be the larger of the numbers.  Since the numbers sum to 15, the other number is $15-y$.   Since four times the smaller number is 60 less than twice the larger, we have: \begin{align*}
4(15-y)&=2y-60\quad\Rightarrow\\
60-4y&=2y-60\quad\Rightarrow\\
120&=6y\quad\Rightarrow\\
20&=y.

We know that the ratio of the speeds of the planes will be equal to the ratio of the distances that each travels.  Since the ratio of the speed of the faster plane to that of the slower one is $\frac{400}{250}$, the distance that the faster plane travels is $20,\!000 \times \frac{400}{250}=\boxed{32,\!000}$ feet.

Another way to do this problem is to use the formula Distance = Rate $\times$ Time. We would use this formula to find, using the information of the first plane, the exact amount of time it took to travel $20,\!000$ feet. Then using this new information we would again apply the formula, this time for the second plane, to find the answer.

If we can express this number as a single power of 10, then we can directly find the number of zeroes at the end of the numbers. Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it. We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\left( a^m \right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$. Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \begin{align*}
(10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div \left(10^{15}\right)^4 &= (10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\

&=10^{67} \div 10^{60} \\

Thus $$\frac{64}{7}\div\frac{8}{3}=\frac{64}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{8}.$$Then we can cancel out the common factor of 64 and 8 which is 8 and we arrive at $$\frac{64}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{8}=\frac{\cancel{8}\cdot8}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{\cancel{8}}.$$Finally, we multiply the remaining terms (make sure to multiply numerators by numerators and denominators by denominators) and we get $$\frac{\cancel{8}\cdot8}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{\cancel{8}}=\frac{3\cdot8}{7}=\boxed{\frac{24}{7}}.$$Note: 24 and 7 have no common denominators so we cannot simplify the fraction further.

The median of a set of values is a number with half of the values in the set greater than it and half of the values in the set less than it. If there are an even number of values in the set, then the median is the average of the two "middle" values. Since there are $8$ counties, the median number of students is the average of the number of students in the county with the $4^\text{th}$ most number of students and the number of students in the county with the $5^\text{th}$ most number of students. Looking at the chart, these two counties both have $29$ students, so the median number of students is $\boxed{29}$ students.

The interior angles of a quadrilateral must add up to 360.  (You can solve for this using the formula: $S = (n-2)(180)$, where S is the sum of the interior angles, and $n$ is the number of sides in the polygon.  However, if you want to get this problem quickly, you should have the value memorized.)  Since two of the angles are right, the other two angles must add up to 180.  Name the smaller angle $x$ - since the larger angle is double the smaller, we have $3x = 180 \rightarrow x = 60$, and $2x = 120$.  Thus, there are $\boxed{120}$ degrees in the larger angle.

Recall that division is multiplication by a reciprocal. So we rewrite the division by $\frac{1}{93}$ as multiplication by the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{93}$. Since the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{93}$ is 93, we get  \[
\frac{1}{31} \div \frac{1}{93} = \frac{1}{31} \cdot 93.
\]Now we can use the commutative property of multiplication to turn this into a division problem:  \[
\frac{1}{31} \cdot 93 = 93 \cdot \frac{1}{31} = 93 \div 31 = \boxed{3}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the last two digits are automatically chosen by mirroring the first two. Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number. For example, the $2$-digit number $57$ gives the palindrome $5775$.

For an integer to be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $3$. A $4$-digit palindrome has two identical pairs of digits. If the total of all four digits is a multiple of $3$, then the first two digits must also add up to a multiple of $3$ (since doubling a non-multiple of $3$ can't give us a multiple of $3$). Thus, to make a $4$-digit palindrome which is a multiple of $3$, we must use a $2$-digit number that is a multiple of $3$.

This tells us that the number of $4$-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$ is identical to the number of multiples of $3$ from $10$ through $99$. Here is a list of those multiples of $3$: $$12, 15, 18, 21, 24, \ldots, 90, 93, 96, 99.$$ This list consists of the $30$ positive multiples of $3$ greater than $10.$ So, there are $30$ numbers in the list, and therefore $\boxed{30}$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$.

Here is a list of those palindromes: $$1221, 1551, 1881, 2112, 2442, \ldots, 9009, 9339, 9669, 9999.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we simplify a small portion of the question: $\frac{8}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{2^3}{9} \cdot \frac{1^4}{2^4}$.  Multiplying these two and combining numerator and denominator, we get $\frac{1 \cdot 2^3}{9 \cdot 2^4}$, which can be made into two fractions and simplified: $\frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{2^3}{2^4} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{18}$.

The inverse of this fraction is $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{18}} = 18$, and $18-17 = \boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the profit, we want to find out how much the math club earned from selling the various baked goods and subtract the cost of producing those goods, $\$15$, from the number we get.

First let's calculate how much the math club earned from selling cookies. The cookies were sold at a price of three for $\$1$, so the math club earned $54\div 3\cdot\$1=18\cdot\$1=\$18$ from selling cookies.

Next, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling cupcakes. At a price of $\$2$ each, the club earned $20\cdot \$2=\$40$ from selling cupcakes.

Finally, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling brownies. At a price of $\$1$ each, the club earned $35\cdot\$1=\$35$ from selling brownies.

Now let's add up these numbers to find out how much the club earned in total and subtract $\$15$ from that number to find the club's profit. We obtain \begin{align*}
\$18+\$40+\$35-\$15&=\$18+\$40+\$35-\$15\\
&=\$18+\$40+\$35+(-\$15)\\
&=\$18+\$40+(\$35+(-\$15))\\
&=\$18+\$40+(\$20)\\
&=\boxed{78}.
\end{align*}Notice how we used the definition of subtraction, $a-b=a+(-b)$ to $\$35-\$15$ as $\$35+(-\$15)$ and the associative property of addition to group the numbers together.

We want to have the least common denominator, $6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions. $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2}{6}$.

Adding this to $\frac{1}{6}$, we obtain $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6}$, which can be simplified further since $3$ and $6$ have a common divisor, $3$.  Dividing both the numerator and denominator by $3$, we find that $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Every five-digit palindrome is of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits.  A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 2 if and only if the digit $A$ is even, so the largest possible digit $A$ is 8.  The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits, which is $2A + 2B + C$, is divisible by 3.

The largest possible digit $B$ is 9, and if $A = 8$, then $2A + 2B + C = C + 34$.  The largest digit $C$ for which $C + 34$ is divisible by 3 is $C = 8$.  Therefore, the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6 is $\boxed{89898}$.

The grade level in which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders is the same grade level in which the percentage of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders. To find what percentage is $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders, we multiply each percentage by $1.35.$ In ninth grade, the percentage is $39.4\cdot1.35=53.19$ percent. In tenth grade, the percentage is $33.1\cdot1.35=44.685$ percent. In eleventh grade, the percentage is $13.8\cdot1.35=18.63$ percent. In twelfth grade, the percentage is $8.6\cdot1.35=11.61$ percent. From inspection, we see that $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders in twelfth grade is closest to the percentage of male bus riders in twelfth grade. So the answer is $\boxed{12}.$

We are trying to determine how many possible combinations of two numbers between 1 and 20 would make it so that the first number is a factor of the second number and the second number is a factor of the first number.  We know that all of the positive factors of a positive number, except for the number itself, are less than the number.  Therefore, if Jenna's number is greater than Mary's number, Jenna's number cannot be a divisor of Mary's number, and Jenna cannot win.

Likewise, if Jenna's number is less than Mary's number, Mary's number must be greater than Jenna's number, Mary's number cannot be a divisor of Jenna's number, and Mary cannot win.  If Jenna's number is equal to Mary's number, both girls' numbers are factors of the other's number because any number is a factor of itself.  Thus, we can determine that for both girls to win, they must roll the same number.  Since there are 20 numbers on the dice, this means that there are $\boxed{20}$ rolls for which both girls would win.

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DA=DB = DC = 5$, so $BC = BD+DC = 10$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(5)({10})}{2} = \boxed{25}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we recall that the reciprocal of a negative number is the negation of the reciprocal: $\frac{1}{-x} = -\frac{1}{x}$. Thus, we can rewrite $\frac{1}{-6}$ as $-\frac{1}{6}$. Now our expression is $-\frac{1}{6} \cdot 6 \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot (7-1)$.

We need to to what is in parentheses first, so we subtract 1 from 7 to get 6. Our expression is now $-\frac{1}{6} \cdot 6 \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6$.

Because multiplication and division is performed before addition and subtraction, we multiply and divide first, going from left to right. A number times its reciprocal is one, so our expression is $(-1) \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6$. Multiplying and dividing from left to right, we find  \begin{align*}
(-1) \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6 &= (-7) + 8\cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 16 \div 8 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 2 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 12.
\end{align*}Now, completing the addition, our answer is $\boxed{5}$.

To begin, take out the factor of 10 and look at 3267.  With a quick check, we can see this number is divisible by 3. Taking out factors of 3, we find $3267=3\cdot1089=3^2\cdot363=3^3\cdot121$.  Since $121=11^2$, the complete factorization is $32670=10\cdot3^3\cdot11^2$.  Therefore, $\sqrt{32670}=\boxed{33\sqrt{30}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $80$ is $2^4\cdot5.$ The positive divisors of $80$ are of the form $2^A5^B,$ where $0 \leq A\leq 4$ and $0\leq B\leq 1.$ The product of any two of these divisors is of the same form: $2^{A_1+A_2}5^{B_1+B_2}.$ Thus, we want to minimize $A_1+A_2$ and $B_1+B_2$ without making $A_1$ or $B_1$ equal to $A_2$ or $B_2,$ respectively. With $\{A_1,A_2\}=\{1,3\},$ we get $a=2^15^0=2$ and $b=2^35^0=8,$ which works. Note that  $ab=16$ is not a divisor of $80.$ The answer is $\boxed{16}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
The two right triangles on the ends of the rectangle can be pushed together to form an equilateral triangle that is identical to each of the other equilateral triangles in the diagram.  So, $AB$ is equal to the total length of 3 side lengths of an equilateral triangle.  Therefore, each side of each equilateral triangle has length $12/3 = 4$.  Therefore, our problem is to find the total area of two equilateral triangles with side length 4.

Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]
unitsize(0.6inch);
pair A, B, C, F;
A = (0,1);
B = rotate(120)*A;
C = rotate(120)*B;
F = foot(A,B,C);
draw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));
draw(A--F);
[/asy]

An altitude of an equilateral triangle is therefore $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of half the side length of the triangle.  Therefore, an equilateral triangle with side length 4 has altitude length $\sqrt{3}(4/2) = 2\sqrt{3}$, and area $(2\sqrt{3})(4)/2 = 4\sqrt{3}$ square units.  The shaded regions consist of two of these equilateral triangles, so their total area is $2(4\sqrt{3}) = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.

We note that $2013$ has the property: since the sum of the digits of 201, $2+0+1=3$, is divisible by $3$, $201$ is itself divisible by $3$. We must now check whether any odd-numbered years before $2013$ have the property. $200$ is not divisible by the prime $7$, so $2007$ does not have this property. Likewise, the sum of the digits of $200$ is $2$, which is not divisible by $3$, so $200$ and $9=3^2$ are relatively prime. Clearly $2011$ does not have the desired property since every natural number is relatively prime to $1$. Thus, the first odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has the desired property is $\boxed{2013}$.

Since 56 is a multiple of 4 and 126 is a multiple of 9, we can factor squares out of both terms, getting $\sqrt{(2\sqrt{14})(3\sqrt{14})}=\sqrt{2\cdot3\cdot14}$. Then, we can factor $2^2$ out of the outer square root to get $2\sqrt{21}$. Thus $a=2$ and $b=21$, yielding $a+b=\boxed{23}$.

That leaves $160-60=100$ aliens with 5 eyes.  Therefore, the total number of eyes is $60\cdot 3 + 100\cdot 5 = 180 + 500 = \boxed{680}$.

Since $\angle 1$ forms a straight line with angle $100^\circ$, $\angle 1=80^\circ$. Since $\angle 2$ forms a straight line with angle $110^\circ$, $\angle 2=70^\circ$. Angle $\angle 3$ is the third angle in a triangle with $\angle E=40^\circ$ and $\angle 2=70^\circ$, so $\angle 3=180^\circ -40^\circ-70^\circ=70^\circ$. Angle $\angle 4=110^\circ$ since it forms a straight angle with $\angle 3$. Then $\angle 5$ forms a straight angle with $\angle 4$, so $\angle 5=70^\circ$. (Or $\angle 3=\angle 5$ because they are vertical angles.) Therefore, $\angle A=180^\circ -\angle 1-\angle 5=180^\circ-80^\circ-70^\circ=\boxed{30^\circ}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 9 vertices in the polygon, so from each vertex there are potentially 8 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 2 of these 8 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $9 \times 6 = 54$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\dfrac{9\times 6}{2} = \boxed{27}$ diagonals.

The three lights blink simultaneously $t$ seconds after the start of the dance if and only if $t$ is a common multiple of 2, 3, and 5. Recall the common multiples of a set of integers are precisely the multiples of the least common multiple. Since 2, 3, and 5 are relatively prime, their least common multiple is $2\cdot 3\cdot 5 = 30$. Thus the light blinks $t$ seconds after the beginning of the song for $t=0,1,2,\ldots,14$, and after 14 thirty-second periods, the song ends. Thus the lights blink in unison a total of $\boxed{15}$ times.

At the end of the first mile, there will be $\frac{2}{3}$ of the initial milk in the bucket. Each additional mile multiplies this amount by $\frac{2}{3}$. Thus, when he arrives at home at the end of the third mile, there will be $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3}$ as much milk in the bucket. Since he had 2 gallons initially, the amount in the bucket when he gets home is $2 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3}$. Because $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, this expression is equivalent to $2 \cdot \frac{2^{3}}{3^{3}}$. Because $n^{a} \cdot n^{b} = n^{a+b}$, this equals $\frac{2^{4}}{3^{3}}$. Multiplying the exponents out, we get $\boxed{\frac{16}{27}}$ gallons.

Make a table to organize the information about the cost and the volume of the three tubes of toothpaste.  Let the number of units of volume in one tube of Fresh be $u$.  Then the cost of one tube of Fresh is $\$u$.  Since Bright is more expensive than Fresh by $60\%$, one tube of Bright costs $\$\,\frac{8}{5}u$.  Also, since Glow has $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ more volume than Fresh, the volume of a tube of Glow is $\frac{4}{3}u$ units.   \[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
& \text{volume} & \text{cost} \\ \hline
\text{Bright} & & \$\,\frac{8}{5}u \\
\text{Fresh} & u & \$\,u\\
\text{Glow} & \frac{4}{3}u &
\end{array}
\]Finally, multiply the volume of Glow by $\frac{3}{4}$ to find the volume of Bright, and multiply the cost of Bright by $\frac{3}{4}$ to find the cost of Glow. \[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
& \text{volume} & \text{cost} \\ \hline

We want to find $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7} - \frac{5}{8}$.  The common denominator is 56, so we try to rewrite each of the three fractions with 56 on the bottom.

$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{28}{28} = \frac{28}{56}$. Also, $\frac{2}{7} = \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{8} = \frac{16}{56}$. Finally, $\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{7}{7} = \frac{35}{56}$.

Thus, we have $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7} - \frac{5}{8} = \frac{28}{56} + \frac{16}{56} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{28+16-35}{56} = \frac{44-35}{56} = \frac{9}{56}$.  Because 9 and 56 have no common divisors, this is the simplest form, and our answer is $\boxed{\frac{9}{56}}$.

The mean of five consecutive integers is equal to the number in the middle. Since the numbers have a mean of $21,$ if we were to distribute the quantities equally, we would have $21,$ $21,$ $21,$ $21,$ and $21.$ Since the numbers are consecutive, the second number is $1$ less than the $21$ in the middle, while the fourth number is $1$ more than the $21$ in the middle. Similarly, the first number is $2$ less than the $21$ in the middle, while the fifth number is $2$ more than the $21$ in the middle.

Thus, the numbers are $21-2,$ $21-1,$ $21,$ $21+1,$ $21+2.$ The smallest of $5$ consecutive integers having a mean of $21,$ is $\boxed{19}.$

First, we rearrange the product as \[\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)^{-1}
\left(\frac{456}{654}\right) \left(\frac{456}{654}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)^{-1}.\]Recall that $a^{-1}$ means the reciprocal of $a$. So $\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)^{-1}$ is the fraction 123/321 times its reciprocal. By the definition of reciprocal, this product is 1. Similarly, $\left(\frac{456}{654}\right) \left(\frac{456}{654}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)^{-1}$ also equal 1. Therefore, the desired product is $1\cdot1\cdot 1=\boxed{1}$.

The easiest way to solve this problem is to convert the wages to US dollars and to ignore the eight-hour day. In one hour Navin makes $160\text{ rupee} \times \frac{1\text{ USD}}{32.35\text{ rupee}}\approx 4.95\; \text{USD}$. Luka makes $25 \text{ kuna} \times \frac{1\text{ USD}}{5.18 \text{ kuna}}\approx 4.83 \text{ USD}$. Ian makes $34\text{ pula} \times\frac{1\text{ USD}}{6.95 \text{ pula}}\approx 4.89 \text{ USD}$.

Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}
(5)\cdot (11) \cdot (13) &= 5\cdot 11\cdot 13 \\
(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\
5\cdot(11\cdot 13) &= 5\cdot 143 \\
(5\cdot 13) \cdot 11 &= 65 \cdot 11\text{, and}\\
(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.  Since E, K, and M do not form a word, we introduce the letter A (which doesn't affect the product since its value is 1) to form the word $\boxed{\text{MAKE}}$.

First, we can use the division rule so that we have an expression with only multiplication of fractions.  We get $$\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\div \frac{12}{20}=\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\cdot \frac{20}{12}.$$Now, notice that $5$ and $20$ have a common factor of $5$.  We can also see that $8$ and $12$ have a common factor of $4$.  Therefore, we can simplify to get $$\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\cdot \frac{20}{12}=\frac{1}{\cancel{5}}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{2}{8}}{7}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{4}{20}}{\cancelto{3}{12}}=\frac{1\cdot 2 \cdot 4}{7\cdot 3}=\boxed{\frac{8}{21}}.$$

Converting the sum to a decimal gives $$
10^0 + 10^1 + 10^2 + 10^3 + 10^4 + 10^5 = 111,\!111.
$$The numbers $10^0,$ $10^1,$ $10^2,$ $10^3,$ $10^4,$ and $10^5$ are all less than $111,\! 111,$ so they all lie to the left of $111,\! 111$ on the number line. Since $10^5$ is greater than $10^0,$ $10^1,$ $10^2,$ $10^3,$ and $10^4,$ it lies further to the right than these five powers of $10$ on the number line, so it is closer to $111,\!111$ than these five powers of $10.$ Therefore, either $10^5$ or $10^6$ have to be the number among the answer choices that is closest to $111,\!111.$

Rounding $111,\!111$ to the nearest million gives $0,$ so $111,\!111$ is at least $500,\!000$ away from $10^6.$

We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\sqrt{6}$. Since the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\sqrt{3}$, the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the lengths of these two legs is $\boxed{\sqrt{6} + 3\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters.

We first calculate the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 0 through 99.  If we consider all such numbers as two-digit (e.g. write 04 instead of 4), the sum of digits will be unchanged.  Then we see that each digit appears an equal number of times in the ones place, and similarly for the tens place, meaning it appears a total of $2\cdot \frac{100}{10} = 20$ times.  Thus the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 00 through 99 is $20\cdot (0 + 1 +\cdots + 8 + 9) = 900$.  The sum of the digits from 100 to 110 is just $(1 + 0) + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2) + \cdots + (1+9) + 2 = 57$.  Thus our final answer is $900 + 57 = \boxed{957}$.

Notice that there are two rectangular holes in the top right corner and the bottom left corner. If these holes were filled, the entire figure would be a rectangle with length $8+9=17$ inches and width $7+4=11$ inches. The area would be $17\cdot11=187$ square inches. The area of the top right hole is $5\cdot3=15$ square inches and the area of the bottom left hole is $8\cdot4=32$ square inches.

We first add a half, a third, and a fourth: $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}$. To do this, we notice that the least common multiple of $2$, $3$, and $4$ is $12$. We can then rewrite each of the three fractions so that they have a denominator of $12$. Since $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{6} = \frac{6}{12}$ , $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{4}{12}$ , and $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{3}{12}$, our sum is: $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{6+4+3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.$$Taking the reciprocal of this sum, we have that our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{12}{13}}$.

We know that 1/16 of a pound of cookie dough can make one cookie and we know that Annie has 3/2 pounds of cookie dough. To find the number of cookies that she can make, we have to find how many 1/16s there are in 3/2. This is the same as asking "what is 3/2 divided by 1/16?" so we want to find $$\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{1}{16}.$$We remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal and the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{16}$ is $\frac{16}{1}$. Therefore, we have that $$\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{16}{1} = \frac{3 \cdot 16}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24.$$Annie can make $\boxed{24}$ cookies.

Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\circ$, so $x=30^\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $30^\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\cdot 12 = \boxed{24}$ meters.

Extracting Answer from: 
We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$. If we divide $360^\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\frac{360^\circ}{60}=6^\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\cdot6^\circ=288^\circ$.

The hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\frac{360^\circ}{12}=30^\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\frac{48}{60}=\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\frac{4}{5}\cdot30^\circ=84^\circ$.

To find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\circ-84^\circ=204^\circ$ and subtract from $360^\circ$ to get $\boxed{156^\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\circ+360^\circ=444^\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\circ-288^\circ=\boxed{156^\circ}$ to find the smaller angle.

Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The length of a diagonal of the square paper is $$\sqrt{2\cdot49}=7\sqrt{2}.$$ Folding the paper in half along a line containing the two endpoints of the diagonal means that we have formed an isoceles right triangle. Therefore the length of each of the equal sides is $$\frac{7\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}=7.$$ Therefore the perimeter of one of the congruent triangles is $7+7+\sqrt{2}\cdot7=\boxed{7(1+\sqrt{2})}$. 

This is called an AIME problem, which means that the final answer should not have a radical in the denominator, so we need to rationalize the denominator. 

Multiplying numerator and denominator by $1-\sqrt{2}$, we get $$7(1+\sqrt{2})\cdot\frac{1-\sqrt{2}}{1-\sqrt{2} }=7\cdot\frac{1-\sqrt{2}+2-2\sqrt{2}}{1-2}=\boxed{7(3-2\sqrt{2})}.$$

The first prime number is $2$ and we know that all prime numbers after that must be odd. $3$, $5$, and $7$ are prime because their only positive integer divisors are $1$ and themselves. $9$ is divisible by $3$ so it is not prime. $11$ and $13$ are prime, but $15$ is not because it is divisible by $3$ and $5$. Continuing, $17$ and $19$ are prime, but $21$ isn't because it is divisible by $3$ and $7$. Finally we know that $23$ is prime.

To sum these nine numbers quicker, we can group them so that they sum to multiples of $10$: \begin{align*}
2+ 3 + 5& + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Suppose the 3 different prime factors are $a$, $b$, and $c$.  The prime powers in the prime factorization of a perfect square must have even exponents.  Since the square must be as small as possible, we let the exponents all be 2, so the prime factorization is $a^2b^2c^2$.  We make the square as small as possible by letting the three primes be 2, 3, and 5, so we have \[a^2b^2c^2 = 2^2\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 = (2\cdot 3\cdot 5)^2 = 30^2 =\boxed{900}.\]

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DB=DC = DA = 6$, so $BC = BD+DC = 12$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(6)({12})}{2} = \boxed{36}.\]

This gives us  \[6\left(-\frac{2}{3}(x-5)\right) = 6\left(\frac32(x+1)\right),\] so  \[-4(x-5) = 9(x+1).\] Expanding both sides gives $-4x + 20 = 9x + 9$.

We know that one dragonfruit is $x-4$ dollars.  This means that one rambutan is $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars.  Then, one starfruit is $(3x-4) -5 = 3x-9$ dollars. We want to find $1 \cdot (3x-4) + 2 \cdot (3x-9) + 3 \cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$. Finally, we combine like terms, yielding $(3x + 6x + 3x) + (-4 + -18 + -12) = (12x) + (-34)$.  We obtain $\boxed{12x -34}$, or $\boxed{-34 + 12x}$.

Specifically, $\angle JFG = 108^\circ$, so \[\angle AFJ = 180^\circ - \angle JFG = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ.\]  Similarly, we have $\angle AJF = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ$.  Finally, the angles of $\triangle AFJ$ sum to $180^\circ$, so \[\angle FAJ = 180^\circ - \angle AFJ - \angle AJF = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 72^\circ = \boxed{36^\circ}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we figure out how many nights it takes for every meerkat to stand guard with every other meerkat exactly once. There are $10$ possibilities for the first guard and $9$ possibilities for the second guard, making $10\cdot 9$ pairs; but this actually counts each pair twice (since it doesn't matter which guard is "first" and which is "second"). So, the number of nights in one complete period is $(10\cdot 9)/2$, which is $45$.

During that period, each meerkat has to stand guard for $9$ nights. So, each meerkat gets $\boxed{36}$ nights of sleep.

Alternative solution: Let's say we want to know how many nights of sleep a particular meerkat (let's call him Max) gets. This is equal to the number of pairs of meerkats that don't include Max. To form such a pair, we can choose the first (non-Max) meerkat in $9$ ways and the second in $8$ ways, but again, this overcounts by a factor of $2$. The number of pairs without Max is thus $(9\cdot 8)/2$, which is $\boxed{36}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:
$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \rightarrow ((5 \cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$
$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \rightarrow (((-2) \cdot 5) - 3) = -13$
$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \rightarrow ((5 \cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$
$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \rightarrow ((3 \cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$
$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \rightarrow ((3 \cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$
$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \rightarrow (((-2) \cdot 3) - 5) = -11$
Thus, our total answer is $\boxed{17}$
Additionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \cdot 5) - (-2) = \boxed{17}$

Extracting Answer from: 
The distance around the equator of the Earth is $2\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the Earth.  Let $h$ be the height of the girl, and assume that her eyes are exactly in the middle of her head so that the line from the center of the Earth to her feet is perpendicular to the line from the center of the Earth to the top of her head.  The top of her head must travel an extra distance equal to the circumference of a circle with radius $h$, her height.  Since the radius of the Earth is $3960$ miles and the girl is $5$ feet tall, this distance is \[2\pi\sqrt{(3960)^2+5^2}-2\pi\cdot 3960\] feet.  We could compute this exactly, but it is not necessary, since the difference is less than 10 percent of the circumference of the earth.

Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)

We begin by noting that    $$\frac{31}{11111} = \frac{31 \times 9}{11111 \times 9} = \frac{279}{99999}.$$We will show that   $$\frac{279}{99999} = 0.\overline{00279},$$so our final answer is $\boxed{5}.$

Proof that $279/99999 = 0.\overline{00279}$:

Let $s = 0.\overline{00279}$. Then multiplying both sides $10^5$ gives   $$10^5 s = 279.\overline{00279}.$$Subtracting the left side by $s$ and the right side by $0.\overline{00279}$ gives   $$99999s = 279,$$so $s = 279/99999$. It follows that $0.\overline{00279} = 279 / 99999,$ as desired.

We therefore have $5\sqrt{5} = w\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\cdot10=\boxed{50}$.

Writing the left-hand side with a common denominator, we have$$\dfrac{x}{2} + \dfrac{x}{3} = \dfrac{3x}{6} + \dfrac{2x}{6} = \dfrac{5x}{6},$$ so our equation is $$\dfrac{5x}{6} = 5.$$Multiplying both sides by $\dfrac{6}{5}$ gives $$x = 5\cdot \dfrac{6}{5} = \boxed{6}.$$

The positive multiples of $63$ are $63$, $126$, $189$, .... All of these numbers except for $63$ are bigger than $63.$ On the other hand, all the positive factors of $63$ other than $63$ are less than $63.$ So if Marie and Jay are thinking of the same positive number, that number must be $63.$

By the same reasoning, the list $-63$, $-126$, $-189$, ..., of negative multiples cannot include any factors of $63$ except $-63$. Thus the two possible values for the number Marie and Jay are thinking of are $-63$ and $63.$ The product of these two numbers is $(-63)(63)=\boxed{-3969}$, since the product of a positive number and negative number is negative.

Since the integer ends in $0$, it is divisible by $2$ and $5$.  Because the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$, the number is divisible by $3$, and we know that a number divisible by both $2$ and $3$ is also divisible by $6$.  If the number is $30$, however, then it is not divisible by $4$, $8$, or $9$.  So exactly $\boxed{4}$ of the numbers in the original problem statement must divide it.

In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\boxed{10}$.

If we start counting from 1, every third consecutive integer is divisible by 3 and every fourth consecutive integer is divisible by 4. So every twelfth integer is divisible by both 3 and 4. Therefore, the number of positive integers less than 100 divisible by both 3 and 4 is just equal to the number of integers between 1 and 100 that are multiples of 12.  $100 \div 12 = 8 \text{ R } 4$, so there are $\boxed{8}$ multiples of 12 between 1 and 100.

To start, find a common denominator on the left side.  The lowest common multiple of 7 and 3 is 21, so this is the common denominator.  Rewrite the equation as: \begin{align*}
\frac{3x}{21}+\frac{7x}{21} &= 1 - x \\
\frac{10x}{21} &= 1 - x \\
\end{align*}We now multiply both sides by $21$ to get $10x = 21 - 21x,$ then $31x = 21.$ So $x = \boxed{\frac{21}{31}}.$

Let the center point be $H$. $ADH$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Since $ABCD$ has area $16$, $AD$ has length $4$.  So $DH$ has length $\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}=2\sqrt{2}$.  Let the marked points on $DH$ and $DC$ be $F$ and $G$ respectively.  Since angle $ADH$ is $45^{\circ}$, so is angle $FDG$.  Thus, since $e$ is a square, triangle $DFG$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Thus $HF=DF=FG$.

Since $DH=2\sqrt{2}$, these are equal to $\sqrt{2}$.  So $DG$ has length $2$, and as $CD$ has length $4$ this means that $CG$ has length $2$.  Since angle $FGD$ is $45^{\circ}$ and $e$ is a square, if we label the marked point on $BC$ as $J$ then angle $CGJ$ is $45^{\circ}$.

Thus triangle $CGJ$, the grey piece, is an isosceles right triangle, and one of its legs is $2$, so its area is $\frac{2^2}{2}=\boxed{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{2}{5} - \frac{5}{12}.\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.

To get this common denominator for the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\frac{48}{120}$.

To get the common denominator for $\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{48}{120} - \frac{50}{120} = \frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \frac{22}{120}.\]Notice that $\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\frac{2\cdot11}{2\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$.

$\frac{2}{5}$ ride the bus and $\frac{5}{12}$ get driven, therefore the fraction of students who don't walk is $\frac{2}{5}+\frac{5}{12}=\frac{24}{60}+\frac{25}{60}=\frac{49}{60}$. We can now subtract the fraction of students who don't walk from 1 to find out the fraction of the students who walk to school. 

1 - $\frac{49}{60}$ = $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$

For this problem, we do not actually need to multiply out the whole thing, and find out exactly what $\left(\frac{1}{23} \right)^{1000}$ equals. That would take a long time! Instead, realize that when we multiply a small fraction like this by itself, the result is smaller than our original fraction. Then if we multiply that result by the original fraction again, the result will be even smaller. Now imagine if we do this $1000$ times. The final result will be a $\emph{very}$ small fraction, close to the integer $\boxed{0}$.

We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\!321/3=\boxed{18,\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).

Extracting Answer from: 
It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\overline{3}$: \[
10 \cdot .0\overline{3} = .\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow .0\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \div 10 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30}.
\]Next, $.\overline{03}$: \[
99 \cdot .\overline{03} = (100-1) \cdot .\overline{03} = 3.\overline{03} - .\overline{03} = 3\\
\Rightarrow .\overline{03} = \frac{3}{99} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 33} = \frac{1}{33}.
\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3} \div .\overline{03} &= \frac{1}{30} \div \frac{1}{33}= \frac{1}{30} \cdot \frac{33}{1}\\
&= \frac{33}{30} = \frac{3 \cdot 11}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{11}{10}\\
&= \frac{10+1}{10} = \boxed{1\frac{1}{10}}.

The formula for the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \text{base} \times \text{height}$.  Using this, we can find the length of $AB$, because we know the area of triangle $ABE$. $$6=\frac{1}{2}AB\times4$$$$12=AB\times4$$$$AB=3$$Since $AB=BC=CD$, $AC=2\times{AB}=6$.

To find $CE$, use the Pythagorean Theorem, treating $CE$ as the hypotenuse of triangle $ACE$. $$4^2+6^2=CE^2$$$$CE^2=52$$Then $CE = \sqrt{52}.$  Rounded to the nearest tenth, this is $\boxed{7.2}.$

All of these numbers need to be rounded to the nearest tenth. To do this, we look at the places after the tenths place. We see two different endings: $0.05001$ and $0.04999.$ Because the $0.05001$ is greater than $0.05,$ we will round the tenths place up in numbers that end in this. In addition, because $0.04999$ is less than $0.05,$ numbers with this ending will be rounded down. Thus, after rounding according to these rules, we get

$\bullet$ A. $14.5$

$\bullet$ B. $14.5$

Since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{~\frac{5}{8}~}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{5}$.  The 5 in the numerator and the 5 in the denominator cancel out, so $\frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{5 \cdot 3}{8 \cdot 5} = \frac{5 \cdot 3}{5 \cdot 8} = \frac{5}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{8}$.  We know that $\frac{5}{5} = 1$, so this leaves us with $\boxed{\frac{3}{8}}$.

Since 5 is the median, there must be two integers greater than 5 and two less than 5. The five integers may be arranged this way: $\underline{\ \ \ }, \ \underline{\ \ \ },  \  5, \  8, \ 8$. Since the mean is 5, the sum of all five integers is 25. The numbers 5, 8, and 8 total 21, leaving 4 for the sum of the first two. They can't both be 2 since 8 is the only mode, so they are 1 and 3. The difference between 8 and 1 is $\boxed{7}$.

Observing a small portion of the expression first, we have: $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = \frac{2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5}{5^2 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 9}$ by combining numerators and denominators through multiplication.  Then, by rearranging, we obtain: $\frac{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 5}{4^2 \cdot 9 \cdot 5^2} = \frac{4}{4^2} \cdot \frac{9}{9} \cdot \frac{5}{5^2} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}$.

Then, we multiply by twenty and raise the expression to the fifth power.  This yields $\left(20 \cdot \frac{1}{20}\right)^5 = 1^5 = \boxed{1}$.

By using this multiplication property on the first two numbers and then on the remaining two numbers, we get  $$a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^k = a^{m+n} \cdot a^k = a^{(m+n)+k} = a^{m+n+k}.$$Now we can use this property,  $$a^m \cdot a^n \cdot a^k = a^{m+n+k},$$to give $$3^{-4} \cdot 3^{-8} \cdot 3^{14} = 3^{(-4)+(-8)+14} = 3^{-12+14} = 3^2 = \boxed{9}.$$

To find out how many ice cream cones Margaret had at noon, we multiply $\frac{2}{3}$ by 72. Since 72 is divisible by 3, we can simplify $\frac{2}{3}\cdot 72$ by re-writing it as $2\cdot \frac{72}{3}$, which equals $2\cdot 24=48.$ To find how many ice cream cones she had at the end of the day, we multiply $\frac{2}{3}$ by 48 to find \[
\frac{2}{3}\cdot 48 = \frac{2\cdot 48}{3} = 2\cdot \frac{48}{3} = 2\cdot 16 = \boxed{32}.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that 1/32 of a gallon of ice cream can make one ice cream cone and that Izzy has 3/4 of a gallon of ice cream left. Therefore, to find the number of ice cream cones that Izzy can make, we have to find how many 1/32s there are in 3/4. This is the same as asking "what is 3/4 divided by 1/32?"

We also know that division by a fraction is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal. Since the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{32}$ is $\frac{32}{1}$, we have that $$\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{32} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{32}{1} = \frac{3 \cdot 32}{4 \cdot 1} = \frac{96}{4} = 24.$$Izzy can sell $\boxed{24}$ more ice cream cones.

A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\dfrac{57}{120}=\boxed{\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page.

Therefore, there are 5 equally likely ways to produce a multiple of 8 out of the $6\cdot6=36$ total combinations for the two dice, so the desired probability is $\boxed{\dfrac{5}{36}}$.

Since $SUR$ is a straight line, then $\angle RUV = 180^\circ - \angle SUV = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.

Since $PW$ and $QX$ are parallel, then $\angle RVW = \angle VTX = 112^\circ$.

Since $UVW$ is a straight line, then $\angle RVU = 180^\circ - \angle RVW = 180^\circ - 112^\circ = 68^\circ$.

Since the measures of the angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, then \[ \angle URV = 180^\circ - \angle RUV - \angle RVU = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 68^\circ = \boxed{52^\circ}. \]

Extracting Answer from: 
Casework is unavoidable. However, we can tell that 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 will work because of their respective divisibility rules. (We know that 1 works because every integer is divisible by 1. We know that 2 works because any number with an even units digit is divisible by 2. We know that 3 works because the sum of the digits of $63$ is $6 + 3 = 9$, and 9 is divisible by 3. We know that 5 works because any number with a units digit of 5 is divisible by 5. We know that 6 works because $66$ is divisible by 2, since the units digit is even, and by 3, since $6 + 6 = 12$, and 12 is divisible by 3.)

The remaining digits are 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

No dividing by 0!  So, we can't have $n=0$.

Testing $n = 4$, we see that 64 is indeed divisible by 4.

Testing $n = 7$, we see by dividing that 67 is not divisible by 7.

Testing $n = 8$, we see by dividing that 68 is not divisible by 8.

Testing $n = 9$, we see using the divisibility rule for 9 that 69 is not divisible by 9 (since the sum of its digits is $6+9=15$ is not divisible by 9).

Thus, the answer is 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is $\boxed{6}$ digits.

Since $\triangle DEF$ is isosceles with $DE=EF$ and $EM$ is perpendicular to $DF,$ we have $$DM=MF=\frac{1}{2}DF=2\sqrt{2}.$$ Since $\triangle DME$ is right-angled, by the Pythagorean Theorem, \begin{align*}
EM^2 &= DE^2 - DM^2 \\
&= 4^2 - (2\sqrt{2})^2 \\
&= 16-8 \\

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 3:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 3 and the 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is $\frac12\cdot 30^\circ = 15^\circ$ from the 4 on the clock, and there are $2\cdot 30^\circ = 60^\circ$ between the 4 and the 6 on the clock.  So, the hour and the minute hand are $15^\circ + 60^\circ =\boxed{75^\circ}$ apart.

The area of a square of side length $s$ is $s^2$. Therefore, the area of the smaller square is $4^2=16$, and the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the entire dart board is $\frac{16}{s^2}$. We are told that this is equal to $\frac49$, so we can solve the equation $\frac{16}{s^2}=\frac49$ for $s$: $$ \begin{aligned} \frac{16}{s^2}&=\frac49 \\ 16\cdot 9&=4s^2\\ 36&=s^2\\ s&=\boxed{6} \end{aligned} $$ Therefore, the side length of the larger square is 6 inches.

However, we have overcounted, since choosing person A first and person B second will give us the same committee as choosing person B first and person A second.  Each committee is counted twice in our original $5 \times 4$ count, so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcount, giving us $(5 \times 4)/2 = \boxed{10}$ ways to choose a 2-person committee from 5 people.

The last clue left states that number $C$ is also NOT a multiple of 3. Out of the two posibilities left, 21 is the only value that is also a multiple of 3, thus eliminating it from being number $C$. Thus, the number $C$ can only be $\boxed{28}$.

Remember that $\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \cdot 3$, which equals $\boxed{75}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Since it has rained 5 times, I have multiplied by $\frac{2}{3}$ a total of 5 times. This is the same as multiplying by $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5$, by definition of the exponent. Similarly, I have multiplied by $\frac{3}{5}$ four times, or multiplied by $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4$.

Because I started with 4 on the whiteboard at the beginning of the month, the number on the board at the end of the month is $\displaystyle 4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4$.

We know that $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$, so we have  $$4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4=4\left(\frac{2^5}{3^5}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{5^4}\right).$$We can make this calculation simpler by rewriting the expression and using the exponent law $\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$, as shown below: \begin{align*} 4\left(\frac{2^5}{3^5}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{5^4}\right)&=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{3^5}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(3^{-1}\right)=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right). \end{align*}Now we evaluate the remaining expressions: $$\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{4\cdot32}{625}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{128}{1875}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The number on the whiteboard at the end of the month will be 4 x  $(\frac{2}{3})^5$ = 1.28, because when it rains, it rains 5 times, so you multiply 2/3 by itself 5 times. After raining 5 times, the number on the whiteboard is therefore 4 x $(\frac{2}{3})^5 = 1.28$. Then it has snowed 4 times, so you multiply 1.28 by $\frac{3}{5}$ four times. 

Therefore, 1.28 x $(\frac{3}{5})^4=0.31104$.

Thus the final number on the whiteboard at the end of the month should be 0.31104.

Because the angle measures are in the ratio $1:3:6$, the angle measures are $x$, $3x$, and $6x$ for some value of $x$.  Because the angles of a triangle add to $180^\circ$, we have $x+3x+6x = 180^\circ$, so $10x = 180^\circ$ and $x =18^\circ$.  Therefore, the largest angle has measure $6x = \boxed{108^\circ}$.

The area that is not watered is the area inside the square but outside the circle. The area of the square is $500\cdot500=250000$ square meters. To find the area of the circle, we note that the diameter of the circle is equal to a side of the square, so the radius is $500/2=250$ meters. Thus, the area of the circle is $\pi 250^2\approx196300$ square meters. Thus, the unwatered region has area $250000-196300\approx\boxed{54000}$ square meters.

Since division by $z$ is the same as multiplication by $\frac{1}{z}$, we are being asked to find \[
x\cdot y \cdot \frac{1}{z}.
\]Since $z=-\frac{11}{13}$, the reciprocal of $z$ is $\frac{1}{z}=-\frac{13}{11}$. So we get \[
\left(-\frac{2}{3}\right)\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)\left(-\frac{13}{11}\right)=\frac{2\cdot5\cdot13}{3\cdot7\cdot 11}=\boxed{\frac{130}{231}}.

Let $x$ be the number of seniors taking both history and science. We see $126$ seniors are taking history and $129$ seniors are taking science. If we add those numbers up, we still have to subtract the seniors that are taking both because we counted them twice.

So there is a total of $126+129-x=200$ students in the senior class. Solving for $x,$ we get there are $\boxed{55}$ seniors taking both history and science.

We can also solve this problem with the Venn Diagram below. Let there be $x$ students taking both history and science: [asy]
label("History", (2,67));
label("Science", (80,67));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));

label("$x$", (44, 45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$126-x$",(28,58));
label(scale(0.8)*"$129-x$",(63,58));
[/asy] There are $200$ seniors total, so we have $x+ (126-x) + (129-x) = 200.$ Simplifying gives $255-x = 200,$ so $x=\boxed{55}.$

We may add multiples of 9 to 2502 to obtain all the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600, and 90 is the greatest multiple of 9 we may add without exceeding 2600.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by rounding each number to the nearest tenth. In order to round to the nearest tenth, we must look at whether the hundredths digit is less than 5, or greater than or equal to 5.

A.	The hundredths place in 67.332 is 3, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3. 67.332 rounds to 67.3.
B.	The hundredths place in 67.473 is 7, which is greater than 5, so the tenths place rounds up to 6. 67.473 rounds to 67.5.
C.	The tenths place in 67.526 is 5, so 67.526 can round to only 67.5 or 67.6, not 67.4.
D.	The hundredths place in 67.445 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 4. 67.445 rounds to 67.4.
E.	The hundredths place in 67.346 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3.

Out of all the answer choices, $\boxed{\text{D}}$ is the only one which rounds to 67.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth, so it must be the closest to 67.4.

To express the number $0.\overline{7}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}
&10x &=& 7&.77777\ldots \\
- &x &=& 0&.77777\ldots \\
\hline
&9x &=& 7 &
\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{9}$.

To find the reciprocal, we just switch the numerator and denominator: $1/{0.\overline{7}} = \boxed{\frac 97}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{10} + \frac{7}{100} + \frac{7}{1000} + \dots = \frac{7}{10}\left(1+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{1000}+\cdots\right)$. 

This sum can be evaluated using the formula for an infinite geometric series, which tells us that $1+\frac1{10}+\frac1{100}+\cdots = \frac{1}{1-1/10} = \frac{10}{9}$. 

Therefore, $0.\overline{7} = \frac{7}{10}\cdot \frac{10}{9} = \frac{7}{9}$. The reciprocal of $\frac{7}{9}$ is $\boxed{\frac{9}{7}}$.

Stripped String: 
$0.\overline{7}=\frac{7}{10}+\frac{7}{100}+\frac{7}{1000}+\dots=\frac{7}{10}(1+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{1000}+\cdots)$.Thissumcanbeevaluatedusingtheformulaforaninfinitegeometricseries,whichtellsusthat$1+\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{100}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-1/10}=\frac{10}{9}$.Therefore,$0.\overline{7}=\frac{7}{10}\cdot\frac{10}{9}=\frac{7}{9}$.Thereciprocalof$\frac{7}{9}$is$\boxed{\frac{9}{7}}$.

The least member of the set is either $\frac{3}{7}$ or $\frac{6}{16}$, since these two members are the only ones smaller than 1. Since $\frac{3}{7}=\frac{6}{14}$, $\frac{6}{16}$ is the smaller of the two. The greatest member is either $\frac{4}{3}$ or $\frac{11}{8}$. Since $\frac{4}{3}=\frac{32}{24}$ and $\frac{11}{8}=\frac{33}{24}$, $\frac{11}{8}$ is the larger of the two. Thus, the desired difference is $\frac{11}{8}-\frac{6}{16}=\frac{22}{16}-\frac{6}{16}=\boxed{1}$.

Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  The legs of one of these triangles measure $12/2=6$ and $16/2=8$ units.  Therefore, the hypotenuse of each triangle measures $\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ units.  Since the side length of the rhombus is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of one of the triangles, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4\cdot 10=\boxed{40}$ units. [asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
First let's convert $0.4\overline8$ to a fraction. Let $p=0.4\overline8$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=4.8\overline{8}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $4.8\overline{8}$ and $0.4\overline{8}$ of these two equations gives $9p=4.4$, which implies $p=44/90 = 22/45$.

Next, let's convert $0.\overline{37}$ to a fraction. Let $q=0.\overline{37}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 100 to obtain $100q = 37.\overline{37}.$ Subtracting the left-hand sides $100q$ and $q$ as well as the right-hand sides $37.\overline{37}$ and $0.\overline{37}$ of these two equations gives $99q = 37$, which implies $q = \frac{37}{99}.$

We add $p$ and $q$ to get our answer: \begin{align*}
\frac{22}{45} + \frac{37}{99} &= \frac{22}{45} \cdot \frac{11}{11} + \frac{37}{99} \cdot \frac{5}{5} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
$\$1$ is equivalent to 800 Italian lire (1200/1.5). On this basis, one million lire was equivalent to: 

$\frac{1000000 \ \text{lire}}{800 \ \text{lire}/\text{dollar}} =1250$ dollars

Therefore, 1,000,000 lire was equivalent to $\boxed{\$1250}$.

We assume the number of girls is a nonnegative integer and no greater than 35. The nonnegative multiples of 13 less than 35 are 0, 13 and 26. As the number of girls is greater than the number of boys, the only valid choice is for there to be 26 girls. That leaves $35-26 = \boxed{9}$ boys at the meeting.
