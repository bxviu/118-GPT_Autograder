The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Encontramos dos números consecutivos que encierran a $x$. Entonces, $\lceil x \rceil$ es el menor número entero con propiedad $\lceil x \rceil \ge x$. Por lo tanto, podemos expresar la ecuación $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$ de la siguiente forma: 

$$\lceil x \rceil + (\lceil x \rceil +a) = \dfrac{23}{7}$$

Donde $a$ es la fracción decimal de $x$. Simplificando la ecuación resultante, obtenemos:

$$2\lceil x \rceil + a = \dfrac{23}{7} \Rightarrow 2\lceil x \rceil = \dfrac{23}{7}-a$$

Puesto que $\lceil x \rceil$ es un número entero, entonces $0\le a<1$. Por lo tanto, tendremos la siguiente cadena de desigualdades:

$$\dfrac{23}{7}-1< 2\lceil x \rceil \le\dfrac{23}{7} \Rightarrow \dfrac{16}{7}< 2\lceil x \rceil \le\dfrac{23}{7}$$

De la última desigualdad, vemos que $\lceil x \rceil$ es $4$ o $5$. Sin embargo, solamente para $\lceil x \rceil =4$ encontramos $a$ tal que $0\le a<1$. Entonces,

$$2\cdot 4 + a = \dfrac{23}{7} \Rightarrow a = \dfrac{9}{14}$$

Entonces, 

$$x = \lceil x \rceil + a = 4 + \dfrac{9}{14} = \boxed{\dfrac{67}{14}}$$

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Primero, tenemos que llevar todo al lado izquierdo de la inecuación para que quede una expresión cuadrática menor o igual que cero: $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. Factorizando, tenemos $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. Entonces, las raíces $x = -2$ y $x = 7$ dividen al plano cartesiano en tres regiones, y en cada una de estas regiones el valor de la expresión tiene un signo particular. Para ver en qué regiones la expresión es menor o igual a cero, podemos hacer una tabla de signos: 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline 
Región & $x < -2$ & $-2 < x < 7$ & $x > 7$ \\ 
\hline 
$(x - 7)$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ \\ 
\hline 
$(x + 2)$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ \\ 
\hline 
$(x - 7)(x + 2)$ & $+$ & $-$ & $+$ \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular} 

Vemos que la expresión es menor o igual a cero en la región $-2 \le x \le 7$, que se expresa en intervalo como $\boxed{[-2, 7]}$.

Let $r$ be the annual interest rate.  Then after three years, Mr. Madoff's investment is $1000 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3$, so \[1000 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3 = 1225.\]Then \[\left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3 = 1.225,\]so \[1 + \frac{r}{100} = \sqrt[3]{1.225} = 1.069987 \dots,\]which means $r = \boxed{7}$, to the nearest integer.

Extracting Answer from: 
El Sr. Madoff invierte 1000 dólares en un fondo que se capitaliza anualmente a una tasa de interés constante. Después de tres años, su inversión ha crecido a 1225 dólares. ¿Cuál es la tasa de interés anual, en porcentaje? (Redondee su respuesta al entero más cercano)

Para solucionar el problema, se puede usar la fórmula para el crecimiento exponencial:

A = P(1 + r)^t

Donde:

- A es la cantidad final (1225 dólares)
- P es la cantidad inicial (1000 dólares)
- r es la tasa de interés anual (lo que estamos buscando)
- t es el número de años (3)

Reemplazando estos valores en la ecuación, obtenemos:

1225 = 1000(1 + r)^3

Dividiendo ambos lados por 1000:

1.225 = (1 + r)^3

Tomando la raíz cúbica de ambos lados:

1.1 ≈ 1 + r

Restando 1 en ambos lados:

0.1 ≈ r

Por lo tanto, la tasa de interés anual es del 10%, aproximadamente.

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
El enunciado nos dice que al sumar dos de los números que nos dan, obtenemos 6 sumas distintas. Podemos recordar que la suma de dos números impares siempre es par, y que la suma de un número impar con un par es impar. De esta manera, podemos inferir que alguno de los números es par (p.ej. $a$), y los restantes son impares.

De las 6 sumas distintas que nos proporcionan (10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29), podemos ver que la única manera de obtener 10 con la suma de dos números impares es sumando 3+7. Siguiendo esta idea, podemos agrupar las sumas en función del número par que podrían tener:

- 10: 3+7
- 18: 5+13
- 19: 3+16
- 20: 7+13
- 21: 5+16
- 29: 13+16

El número que aparece dos veces en estas sumas es el $13$. Por tanto, $b$ y $c$ son 13 y otros dos números impares distintos. Podemos ver que 21=13+8, por lo que $d$ debe ser el número impar restante: 8.

Así, los cuatro números son 3, 7, 8 y 13, que ordenados de menor a mayor dan: 3, 7, 8, 13.

Comencemos por separar en dos casos, uno con el valor absoluto de $5x - 1$ y otro con el valor absoluto de $3x + 2$. Si $5x - 1 \geq 0$, entonces $|5x - 1| = 5x - 1$, y si $3x + 2 \geq 0$, entonces $|3x + 2| = 3x + 2$. Entonces podemos escribir la ecuación como $5x - 1 = 3x + 2$, la cual tiene solución $x = \frac{3}{2}$. Si $5x - 1 < 0$, entonces $|5x - 1| = -(5x - 1) = -5x + 1$, y si $3x + 2 < 0$, entonces $|3x + 2| = -(3x + 2) = -3x - 2$.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

As the problem suggests, we need to compute the lengths of the diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$. By the distance formula,

\begin{align*}
AC &= \sqrt{(12 -0)^2 + (-2-7)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = 15\\
BD &= \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\\
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\frac 12 \cdot 10 \cdot 15 = \boxed{75}$.

El área del romboide es la mitad del producto de sus diagonales. Puesto que la diagonal mayor $AC$ biseca la diagonal menor $BD$ perpendicularmente, entonces las longitudes de las diagonales son $AC=13$ y $BD=2\cdot 4=8$. Así, el área del romboide es $\frac{13\cdot 8}{2}=52$. Como se trata de un romboide, su altura $h$ es la distancia entre los lados opuestos que tienen la misma longitud, por lo que $h = AB = CD = 7-0 = 12-(-2) = 14$. Entonces, el área del romboide es $bh = 52$, donde $b$ es la longitud de una diagonal de $ABCD$. Como $ABCD$ es un romboide, tiene diagonales congruentes, así que $b=AC=13$. Entonces, se tiene que el área de $ABCD$ es $\frac{13\cdot 14}{2}=\boxed{91}$.

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Para determinar el dominio de la función $g(x)$, notamos que debemos asegurarnos que la expresión dentro de la raíz cuadrada sea no negativa, es decir:
$$(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2 \geq 0.$$

Podemos factorizar la expresión:
$$(x-3+x-8)(x-3-x+8)\geq 0,$$
$$(2x-11)(5-x)\geq 0.$$

La desigualdad se cumple cuando $(2x-11)(5-x)=0$ o $(2x-11)(5-x)<0$. Resolviendo la primera ecuación obtenemos $x=\frac{11}{2}$, que es el único punto aislado en el dominio de $g(x)$. La segunda ecuación se cumple cuando $2x-11<0$ y $5-x>0$ ó $2x-11>0$ y $5-x<0$. Es decir, $x\in(5, \frac{11}{2})\cup(\frac{11}{2},+\infty)$.

Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\

\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\

Extracting Answer from: 
Diez treeks pesan lo mismo que tres squigs y un goolee. Dos treeks y un goolee tienen el mismo peso que un squig. ¿Cuántos treeks en total pesan lo mismo que un squig? 

Para resolver este problema, podemos hacer un sistema de ecuaciones. Llamaremos "x" al peso de un treek y "y" al peso de un squig:

10x = 3y + 1g

2x + 1g = y

Queremos saber cuántos treeks pesan lo mismo que un squig, por lo que podemos sustituir "y" en la primera ecuación por "2x + 1g":

10x = 3(2x + 1g) + 1g

10x = 6x + 4g

4x = 4g

x = g

Entonces, sabemos que un treek pesa lo mismo que un goolee. Para saber cuántos treeks necesitamos para igualar el peso de un squig, podemos usar la segunda ecuación:

2x + 1g = y

2g + 1g = y

3g = y

Por lo tanto, necesitamos 3 treeks para igualar el peso de un squig.

Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime roots. Then, we know that $m = p+q$ and $n = pq$. Since $m < 20$, the primes $p$ and $q$ must both be less than $20$.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\

Los valores de las raíces de la ecuación cuadrática $x^2-mx+n$ son primos y positivos (no necesariamente distintos). Teniendo en cuenta que $m<20$, ¿cuántos valores posibles tiene $n$?

Las raíces de la ecuación cuadrática son $p$ y $q$, donde $p$ y $q$ son primos y $pq=n$. Según el enunciado, los dos números primos son positivos. Si $p=2$, entonces $q$ debe ser igual a $2$, lo que implica que $m$ es igual a $4$, lo cual no es posible porque $m<20$. Por lo tanto, ambos primos $p$ y $q$ deben ser mayores que $2$, por lo que $n$ es impar.

Sabemos que el producto de dos números primos impares es un número impar. Por lo tanto, $n$ es impar, y como $n=pq$ es un producto de dos números primos, entonces $n$ tiene que ser el producto de dos números impares.

Hay 8 números impares positivos menores que 16, que es el mayor número impar que puede ser el valor de $p$ o de $q$. Estos son: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, y 15. Estos son los diferentes valores que $n$ puede tomar. Por lo tanto, hay $\boxed{8}$ valores posibles para $n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
La relación entre la presión y el volumen de un gas a temperatura constante es inversamente proporcional. Si tenemos un gas de hidrógeno en un contenedor de 3.67 litros con una presión de 4 kPa y lo movemos a un contenedor de 1.835 litros a la misma temperatura, ¿cuál será la nueva presión en kPa?

Usando la ley de Boyle-Mariotte, podemos determinar el cambio en la presión del gas. Esta ley establece que la presión del gas es inversamente proporcional al volumen del recipiente que lo contiene.

P₁V₁ = P₂V₂

Donde P representa la presión, V representa el volumen y los subíndices 1 y 2 representan las condicionas iniciales y finales, respectivamente.

Para resolver este problema, podemos escribir la ecuación de la siguiente manera:

P₁ = 4 kPa
V₁ = 3.67 L
V₂ = 1.835 L
P₂ = ¿?

P₁V₁ = P₂V₂

4 kPa x 3.67 L = P₂ x 1.835 L

14.68 kPa L = P₂ x 1.835 L

P₂ = 14.68 kPa L / 1.835 L

P₂ = 8 kPa

Por lo tanto, la nueva presión del gas de hidrógeno en el contenedor más pequeño será de 8 kPa.

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

The roots of the quadratic equation $x^2-7x+c=0$ are real and rational if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is a perfect square where $a=1$, $b=-7$, and $c$ is an unknown constant. Hence, we require $49-4c=d^2$ for some non-negative integer $d$. Rearranging gives $c=\frac{49-d^2}{4}$, so $\frac{49-d^2}{4}$ must be a positive integer. Thus, we must have $d$ odd and $d\leq 7$ (if $d\geq 9$, then $d+7>2\sqrt{d^2-49}$ and hence $d^2+2d+49>(d+1)^2$, which implies that $d^2-4\cdot \frac{49-d^2}{4} =5d^2-196\leq (d-2)^2$, a contradiction since $5d^2-196 > d^2$ for all $d\geq 2$). Thus, the possible values of $d$ are $1, 3, 5,$ and $7$. These correspond to $c=12, 5, 0,$ and $3$, respectively. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{12,5,3,0}$.

We can find the roots of this equation by using the quadratic formula: $$x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - (4)(1)(9)}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm i\sqrt{11}}{2}.$$ We wish to find $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, which is \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{5 + i\sqrt{11}}{2} - 1\right)\left(\frac{5 - i\sqrt{11}}{2} - 1\right) &= \left(\frac{3 + i\sqrt{11}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{3 - i\sqrt{11}}{2}\right) \\

We wish to find $(a - 1)(b - 1) = ab - (a + b) + 1$. If $a$ and $b$ are roots of this quadratic, then Vieta's formulas give us that $ab = 9$ and $a + b = 5$. Substituting these values, we find that $(a - 1)(b - 1) = 9 - 5 + 1 = \boxed{5}$.

Dado que los valores de $a$ y $b$ no están dados, podemos usar las raíces de la fórmula cuadrática para encontrarlos. Usando la fórmula cuadrática, obtenemos que 

$$x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.$$

Por lo tanto, $a = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ y $b = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$. Ahora podemos calcular $(a-1)(b-1)$:


\begin{align*}
(a - 1)(b - 1) &= \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1\right)\left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1\right) \\
&= \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \\
&= \frac{9 - 5}{4} \\
&= \frac{4}{4} \\
&= 1.

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Al tener una ecuación cuadrática en la forma $ax^2+bx+c=0$, sabemos que las soluciones están dadas por la fórmula $$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$ 

Si las dos soluciones de la ecuación $x^2+bx+48=0$ están en razón $3:1$, significa que podemos escribirlas como $x_1=3k$ y $x_2=k$ para algún valor de $k$. Al resolver la ecuación utilizando estas soluciones, obtenemos $$(x-3k)(x-k)=x^2-(3k+k)x+3k^2= x^2+(b)x+48=0.$$ Por lo tanto, tenemos que $b=(3k+k)=-4k$. 

La pregunta pide el valor máximo de $b$, por lo que buscamos el valor más grande para $k$ que aún nos dé soluciones reales para la ecuación cuadrática. Sabemos que la longitud de la hipotenusa de un triángulo rectángulo es mayor que cualquiera de sus lados, por lo que deseamos que $3k$ sea la hipotenusa de un triángulo rectángulo con catetos de longitud $k$. La relación $3:1$ implica que los lados del triángulo deben tener longitud $k$, $\frac{1}{4}b$ y $\frac{3}{4}b$.

Utilizando el teorema de Pitágoras, tenemos $$(3k)^2=k^2+\left(\frac{1}{4}b\right)^2$$ y $$(3k)^2=k^2+\left(\frac{3}{4}b\right)^2.$$ Estas ecuaciones se simplifican a $8k^2=\frac{1}{16}b^2$ y $8k^2=\frac{9}{16}b^2$, respectivamente. Igualando estas expresiones y resolviendo para $k$, encontramos que $k=\frac{b\sqrt{2}}{12}$. 

Deseamos el valor máximo de $b$ que aún nos asegure que las soluciones sean reales, por lo que requerimos que la radicando en la fórmula cuadrática sea no negativa. $$b^2-4(1)(48) \ge 0.$$ Simplificando obtenemos $$b^2 \ge 192,$$ y tomando la raíz cuadrada en ambos lados obtenemos $$|b| \ge 8\sqrt{3}.$$ Como $b=-4k$, maximizamos $|b|$ al minimizar $k$. La expresión para $k$ nos dice que lo minimizamos cuando $b$ se minimiza, por lo que tomamos $b=8\sqrt{3}$ y encontramos $k=\frac{4\sqrt{6}}{3}$. Reemplazando en la expresión para $b$ obtenemos $$b=-4k=-\frac{16\sqrt{6}}{3},$$ que es nuestra respuesta final.

Let $f$ be the cost of a pound of feathers and $g$ the cost of an ounce of gold.  We have \begin{align*}
8f+2g&=932 \\
14f+3g&=1402
\end{align*}Solving the first equation for $g$ we get $g=466-4f$.  Substituting into the second equation, we solve \[
14f+3(466-4f)=1402
\]to find $f=2$.  Substituting into $g=466-4f$ we have $g=458$.  Thus five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold costs $5(f+g)=\boxed{2300}$ dollars.

Extracting Answer from: 
Primero, podemos intentar convertir las onzas en libras para que todo esté en la misma unidad. Sabemos que hay 16 onzas en una libra, por lo que dos onzas de oro equivalen a $2/16= 1/8$ de una libra de oro. Entonces, tenemos el siguiente sistema de ecuaciones:

\begin{align*}
8F + \frac{1}{8}G &= 932 \\
14F + \frac{3}{8}G &= 1402
\end{align*}

donde $F$ es el costo en dólares de una libra de plumas y $G$ es el costo en dólares de una libra de oro. 

Podemos resolver este sistema de ecuaciones de varias maneras (sustitución, eliminación, matrices), pero para este ejemplo, usaremos el método de sustitución. Podemos despejar $G$ de la primera ecuación y obtener:

$$G = (932 - 8F) \cdot 8$$

Luego podemos sustituir esto en la segunda ecuación y resolver para $F$:

\begin{align*}
14F + \frac{3}{8}(932-8F)\cdot 8 &= 1402 \\
14F + 2792 - 24F &= 1402 \\
-10F &= -1390 \\
F &= 139
\end{align*}

Ahora podemos sustituir $F$ en la primera ecuación para obtener $G$:

\begin{align*}
8F + \frac{1}{8}G &= 932 \\
8\cdot 139 + \frac{1}{8}G &= 932 \\
G &= 480
\end{align*}

Entonces, una libra de plumas cuesta $\$139$ y una libra de oro cuesta $\$480$. 

Finalmente, podemos calcular el costo de cinco libras de plumas y cinco onzas de oro. Cinco libras de plumas son simplemente $5\cdot 139 = 695$ dólares. Para convertir cinco onzas de oro a libras, dividimos entre 16 y obtenemos $5/16$ de una libra de oro. Multiplicando esto por el costo por libra de oro, obtenemos $5/16\cdot 480 = 150$ dólares. Por lo tanto, el costo total de cinco libras de plumas y cinco onzas de oro es de $\$695 + \$150 = \boxed{\$845}$.

If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}
\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2}&=\frac{3}{-2} \\

Para que los puntos estén en la misma línea recta, las pendientes entre cada par de puntos deben ser iguales. La pendiente entre el primer y segundo punto es $\frac{-14 - (-5)}{p - 2}=\frac{-9}{p-2}$. La pendiente entre el segundo y tercer punto es $\frac{-17 - (-14)}{p+2 - p}= - \frac{3}{2}$. Como las pendientes deben ser las mismas, tenemos $$\frac{-9}{p-2}=-\frac32 \Rightarrow p = \frac{15}{2}.$$ Para encontrar $q$, podemos usar cualquier punto en la línea recta. Eligimos el punto en el segundo renglón, por lo que $p= \frac{15}{2}$ y $y=-14$. La ecuación de la línea recta es $y-(-14)=\frac{-9}{\frac{15}{2}-2}(x-\frac{15}{2})$, y al evaluar en $x=13$, encontramos que $q=\frac{11}{2}$.

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 40%" border="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;"><strong>Intervalo</strong></td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;"><strong>$(x^2+2)^2-25$</strong></td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;"><strong>$(x^2+2)(x^2-3)$</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(-\infty,-\sqrt{3})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(-\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{2})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(-\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{-2})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(-\sqrt{-2},-\sqrt{3})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(-\sqrt{3},\sqrt{-2})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(\sqrt{-2},\sqrt{2})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">+</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">$(\sqrt{3},\infty)$</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td><td style="width: 100px; text-align: center;">-</td></tr></tbody></table>

Notemos que para que la desigualdad original sea verdadera, los factores deben tener signos opuestos. Entonces, los intervalos donde la desigualdad original se cumple son $(-\sqrt{3},-\sqrt{2})\cup(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$. En intervalo de soluciones es entonces $(-\sqrt{3},\sqrt{3})$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Primero, notamos que podemos racionalizar el denominador de $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ y $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ para obtener que $\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ es igual a:
\[\sqrt{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{6}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2}}{3}\]
A continuación, tomamos un denominador común para sumar las fracciones:
\[\frac{\frac{6\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{6}}{6} + \frac{4\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{2}}{6}}{1} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{6}}{3}\]

Por lo tanto, $a+b+c = 2+3+3 = \boxed{8}.$

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

--OR--

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Sea $r$ el radio del círculo definido por la ecuación $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$. Observamos que podemos escribirla como $$ (x-7)^2 + (y-24)^2 = r^2 + 7^2 + 24^2. $$ Es decir, el círculo tiene centro en $(7,24)$ y radio $r = \sqrt{r^2 + 7^2 + 24^2}$. Geométricamente, queremos encontrar la mayor ordenada de un punto en el círculo, que corresponderá a la ordenada de su punto de intersección con la recta vertical que pasa por su centro, que es $y=24$.

Luego, usando la fórmula para la distancia entre dos puntos, tenemos que $$ r^2 = (x-7)^2 + (y-24)^2 \geq (y-24)^2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad r \geq |y-24|. $$ Pero por otra parte, $$ r^2 = 14x + 48y \leq 14x + 48r + 576 = 16r^2 + 48r + 576, $$ entonces $$ 0 \leq 15r^2 - 48r - 576 = (3r+24)(5r-32), $$ lo que nos da $r \geq 32/5$ (el radio debe ser no negativo).

Combinando ambos resultados, tenemos que $$ |y-24| \leq r \leq \frac{32}{5}, $$ y entonces la mayor ordenada de un punto en el círculo es $y=24+\frac{32}{5} = \boxed{\frac{152}{5}}$.

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
La librería está decidiendo qué precio cobrar por un libro en particular. Después de investigar, la tienda encuentra que si el precio del libro es de $p$ dólares (donde $p \le 32$), entonces el número de libros vendidos por mes es de $128-4p$. ¿Qué precio debiera cobrar la tienda para maximizar sus ingresos? 

Para maximizar los ingresos, debemos encontrar el precio que hace que los ingresos de la librería sean máximos. Los ingresos son iguales al número de libros vendidos multiplicado por el precio del libro, es decir, $R(p)=(128-4p)p$. 

Podemos encontrar el valor de $p$ que maximiza $R(p)$ calculando la primera derivada: 

$$R'(p)=128-8p$$

Igualando esta expresión a cero, obtenemos:

$$128-8p=0$$
$$p=16$$

Entonces, para maximizar sus ingresos, la librería debiera cobrar $\$16$ por el libro.

Let's play with the given condition a little. Clearing out the denominator gives $4a+3b=5(a-2b)=5a-10b$. Selectively combine like terms by adding $9b-4a$ to both sides to get $12b=a-b$. This gives $\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1$.

Now, we want to find $\dfrac{a+11b}{a-b}$. Rewrite this as $\dfrac{a-b+12b}{a-b}=\dfrac{a-b}{a-b}+\dfrac{12b}{a-b}=1+1=\boxed{2}$, and we are done.

Empecemos por simplificar la ecuación $\frac{4a+3b}{a-2b}=5$. Podemos empezar por multiplicar ambos lados de la ecuación por $a-2b$ para eliminar el denominador en el lado izquierdo de la ecuación. Esto nos da $4a+3b=5(a-2b)$. Ahora podemos simplificar esto para obtener $4a+3b=5a-10b$. Al trasladar $4a$ al lado derecho y $10b$ al lado gauche, queda $6b=a$, que es una ecuación útil para simplificar la expresión original. 

Podemos reemplazar $a$ en la expresión $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}$ con $6b$, lo que nos da $\frac{6b+11b}{6b-b}=\frac{17b}{5b}$, que es la respuesta simplificada.

This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Si se compran menos de 60 boletos, cada uno cuesta $\$70$, lo que significa que si se compran $x$ boletos el costo total sería de $C(x) = 70x$. 

Si se compran más de 60 boletos, por cada boleto adicional al número 60 se reduce en $\$1$ el costo de cada boleto. Así que si se compran $x$ boletos con $x>60$, entonces cada boleto tendría un costo de $70-x+60=130-x$ dólares y el costo total sería de $C(x) = x(130-x)$. 

Queremos encontrar el mayor valor de $x$ tal que la ganancia sea mayor a $\$4200$. La ganancia es igual a la diferencia entre el ingreso de la venta de boletos y el costo de comprar esos boletos, es decir: 

$$G(x) = 70x - \begin{cases} 4200 &\text{si } x\leq 60\\ x(130-x)-4200 &\text{si } x>60 \end{cases}$$

Para encontrar el mayor valor de $x$ tal que $G(x)>0$, tenemos que encontrar el punto de inflexión de la función $G(x)$. Derivando dos veces tenemos: 

$$G''(x) = -2$$

Que es una constante negativa, lo que significa que la función $G(x)$ es cóncava hacia abajo para todo valor de $x$. Entonces, el punto de inflexión es el máximo de la función $G(x)$.

El máximo se encuentra en $x=65$ y $G(65) = 4550$.  Por lo tanto, para que el parque de diversiones tenga una ganancia mayor a $\$4200$ se deben comprar $65$ o más boletos en un solo pedido.

First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

La ecuación $x(x+5) = -n$ se puede reescribir como $x^2+5x+n=0$. La solución a esta ecuación está dada por la fórmula general $x=\frac{-5\pm\sqrt{25-4n}}{2}$. Para que no haya soluciones reales, necesitamos que el radicando sea negativo, es decir, $25-4n<0$. Esto se cumple para $n\ge7$, ya que si $n=7$, el radicando es $-3$ y si $n=8$, el radicando es $-7$.
