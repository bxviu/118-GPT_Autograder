Extracting Answer from: 
The graph has vertical asymptotes whenever the denominator of the function is equal to zero, so we need to factor the denominator $x^2+x-6$ and set it equal to zero. Observe that $x^2+x-6=(x+3)(x-2)$, so the denominator is zero when $x=-3$ or $x=2$. Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20, we need to first find each of these numbers. 

$120\%$ of 30 is equal to $1.2 \cdot 30 = 36$ 

$130\%$ of 20 is equal to $1.3 \cdot 20 = 26$ 

Now, we need to find the positive difference between these two numbers. 

$36 - 26 = 10$ 

Therefore, the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20 is $\boxed{10}$.

First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_reverse_answers/1001_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by analyzing the equation $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}.$ We notice that $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer and that $\dfrac{23}{7}$ is not an integer, so $x$ must have a fractional component. If we subtract $\lceil x \rceil$ from both sides of the equation, we find $$x=\frac{23}{7}-\lceil x \rceil.$$Because $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer, the difference $\dfrac{23}{7}-\lceil x \rceil$ must have a fractional component. Therefore, we can say $$x=\frac{23}{7}-\lceil x \rceil=\frac{23-7\lceil x \rceil}{7}.$$Thus, we found that $x$ is equal to $$(\text{some integer})+\frac{23-7\lceil x \rceil}{7}.$$Therefore, $x$ can be written in the form $\dfrac{a}{7}+\dfrac{b}{7},$ where $a$ is an integer and $b$ has a minimum value of $1$ because $x$ has a fractional component. Thus, $x=\dfrac{a+b}{7}$, and substituting this into the original equation gives $\lceil \dfrac{a+b}{7} \rceil + \dfrac{a+b}{7} = \dfrac{23}{7}.$

Now, we notice that $\lceil \dfrac{a+b}{7} \rceil$ is equal to $\dfrac{a+b+\left\lfloor \frac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor+1}{7}$ because $a+b$ and $\left\lfloor \dfrac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor$ have the same remainder when divided by $7.$ Thus, we have the equation $$\dfrac{a+b+\left\lfloor \frac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor+1}{7}+\dfrac{a+b}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}.$$Simplifying this equation gives $$\frac{2a+2b+\left\lfloor \frac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor+1}{7}=\frac{23}{7}.$$We see that $\dfrac{23}{7}$ is equal to $\dfrac{3\cdot 7 + 2}{7},$ so $\dfrac{a+b+\left\lfloor \frac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor+1}{7}=3.$ Therefore, $a+b+\left\lfloor \dfrac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor +1=21.$ Letting $a+b=q$ and $\left\lfloor \dfrac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor=p,$ we find that $q+p+1=21,$ so $q+p=20.$

Since $q=a+b,$ we see that $q$ can be any integer between $1$ and $12$ inclusive. Thus, $(q,p)$ can be $(1,19),$ $(2,18),$ $\cdots,$ $(11,9),$ or $(12,8).$ Using each pair of values for $a+b$ and $\left\lfloor \dfrac{a+b}{7} \right\rfloor$ in the equation $x=\dfrac{a+b}{7}$ gives $11$ possible solutions for $x,$ namely $$\frac{1}{7}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{8}{7}, \frac{9}{7}, \frac{10}{7}, \frac{11}{7}, \frac{12}{7}.$$Therefore, the solutions of the equation $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$ are $$x=\boxed{\frac{a+b}{7}}=\frac{1}{7}, \frac{2}{7}, \frac{3}{7}, \frac{4}{7}, \frac{5}{7}, \frac{6}{7}, \frac{8}{7}, \frac{9}{7}, \frac{10}{7}, \frac{11}{7}, \frac{12}{7}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the annual interest rate, we need to use the compound interest formula:

Final amount = (Initial amount) x (1 + rate)^time

We know that the initial amount is 1000 dollars, the final amount is 1225 dollars, and the time is 3 years.  So we can write:

1225 = 1000 x (1 + rate)^3

Dividing both sides by 1000, we get:

1.225 = (1 + rate)^3

To solve for the rate, we need to take the cube root of both sides:

cube root of 1.225 = 1 + rate

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

rate = cube root of 1.225 - 1

Using a calculator or estimation, we find that the cube root of 1.225 is approximately 1.1.  Subtracting 1, we get:

rate = 0.1

So the annual interest rate is 0.1, or 10%, rounded to the nearest integer.

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the inverse of $h(x)$, we need to first find $h(x)$. We start with the inside function $g(x)$, which subtracts one from $x$, and then we apply the outside function $f(x)$, which multiplies the result by 7 and adds 5. So, putting it all together, $h(x) = f(g(x)) = 7(x-1)+5 = 7x-2$.

Now to find the inverse of $h(x)$, we need to solve for $x$ in terms of $h(x)$. We start by setting $h(x) = y$, so $y = 7x-2$. We then isolate $x$ by adding 2 and dividing by 7: 

\begin{align*}
y &= 7x-2 \\
y+2 &= 7x \\
\frac{y+2}{7} &= x.
\end{align*}

Thus, the inverse of $h(x)$ is $\boxed{\dfrac{x+2}{7}}$.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the sum of all integers that satisfy the conditions, we first need to find all the integers that satisfy each condition individually.

For the first condition, we have $|x| + 1 > 7$. Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$. This is true for all $x$ such that $x < -6$ or $x > 6$. The integers that satisfy this condition are shown in the following diagram:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccccccccccc}
x   & \ldots & -9 & -8 & -7 & -6 & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &      7 & 8 & 9 & \ldots \\
|x| & \ldots &  9 &  8 &  7 &  6 &  5 &  4 &  3 &  2 &  1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 &      7 & 8 & 9 & \ldots \\
\end{array}
$$

For the second condition, we have $|x + 1| \le 7$. This means that $-7 \le x + 1 \le 7$. Solving for $x$ gives $-8 \le x \le 6$. The integers that satisfy this condition are shown in the following diagram:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
x+1 & \ldots & -7 & -6 & -5 & -4 & -3 & -2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & \ldots \\
|x+1| & \ldots &  7 &  6 &  5 &  4 &  3 &  2 &  1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & \ldots \\
\end{array}
$$

To find the integers that satisfy both conditions, we need to find the intersection of the two sets of integers. This is shown in the following diagram:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
x & -9 & -8 & -7 & -6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & \ldots \\
\end{array}
$$

The sum of these integers is $-9 + (-8) + (-7) + (-6) + 7 + 8 + 9 = -6$. Therefore, the answer to the problem is $\boxed{-6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment, we can start by finding the midpoint of the segment. The $x$-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the $x$-coordinates of the endpoints, which in this case is $\frac{1+1}{2}=1$. The $y$-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the $y$-coordinates of the endpoints, which in this case is $\frac{4+10}{2}=7$. Therefore, the midpoint of the segment is $(1,7)$. To find the sum of the coordinates, we simply add $1+7=\boxed{8}$.

As the problem suggests, we need to compute the lengths of the diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$. By the distance formula,

\begin{align*}
AC &= \sqrt{(12 -0)^2 + (-2-7)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = 15\\
BD &= \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\\
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\frac 12 \cdot 10 \cdot 15 = \boxed{75}$.

Since the area of a kite is half the product of its diagonals, we can find the area of $ABCD$ by finding the product of its diagonals and dividing by $2.$

Using the distance formula, we have $AC=\sqrt{(12-0)^2+(-2-7)^2}=\sqrt{170}$ and $BD=\sqrt{(7-1)^2+(8-0)^2}=10\sqrt{2}.$

Therefore, the area of $ABCD$ is $$\frac12\cdot(AC)(BD)=\frac12\cdot(\sqrt{170})(10\sqrt{2})=\boxed{5\sqrt{85}}.$$

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we notice that $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2$ will always be negative if $x<3$ or $x>8$. Therefore, the domain of $g(x)$ is $3 \leq x \leq 8$. 
Next, we consider the quantity inside the square root: $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2 = (x-3+x-8)(-5) = -5(2x-11)$. 
So, we want to find the smallest real number $x$ in the interval $3 \leq x \leq 8$ such that $-5(2x-11) \geq 0$. Dividing by $-5$ and flipping the inequality, we get $2x-11 \leq 0$, which implies $x \leq 5.5$. 
Thus, the smallest real number $x$ in the domain of $g(x)$ is $\boxed{5.5}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The answer is $\boxed{064}$. 

Let's start at the end of the problem and work our way backwards. We want to find the value of $A+B+C$, so let's call that $x$: $A+B+C = x$. 

We know that $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$. Multiplying both sides by $\frac{C}{\sqrt{B}}$, we get $A = \frac{9C}{2\sqrt{3}\sqrt{B}} = \frac{3C}{\sqrt{B}}$. 

Now we can substitute that expression for $A$ into our equation $A+B+C = x$: $\frac{3C}{\sqrt{B}} + B + C = x$. 

We also know that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, so we can say that $\gcd(A,C) = 1$, and since $A = \frac{3C}{\sqrt{B}}$, we have $\gcd(3,C) = 1$. 

Looking at the expression $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, we have $\frac{A}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3B}}$. Since $\gcd(A,C) = 1$, we know that $C$ must be a factor of $2\sqrt{3B}$. But since $\gcd(3,C) = 1$, we know that $C$ can't be a factor of 2, so $C$ must be a factor of $\sqrt{3B}$.

Now we can use this to simplify our expression for $x$: $\frac{3C}{\sqrt{B}} + B + C = \frac{3C}{C}\sqrt{3B} + B + C = 3\sqrt{3B} + B + C = x$. 

We want $x$ to be as small as possible, so we want $B$ to be as small as possible. Since $B$ can't have any perfect-square factors other than 1, the smallest value of $B$ that works is 3. 

Now we can plug in $B = 3$ into our equation for $x$: $3\sqrt{3\cdot3} + 3 + C = x$, so $9\sqrt{3} + 3 + C = x$. We want $x$ to be an integer, so $C$ must be $-\lfloor 9\sqrt{3} \rfloor - 3 = -30$. 

Finally, we can plug in $B = 3$ and $C = -30$ to find $A$: $A = \frac{3C}{\sqrt{B}} = -30\sqrt{3}$. 

Now we can check that our solution works: $A+B+C = -30\sqrt{3} + 3 + (-30) = -57 - 30\sqrt{3}$. Rearranging that gives us $\boxed{064}$.

Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\

\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig, we need to use a reverse approach. Let's assume the weight of one squig to be x. 

According to the problem, 10 treeks weigh the same as 3 squigs and 1 goolee. Let's represent the weight of one treek as t. 

So, we can write the following equation: 

10t = 3x + g     ----(1)

Next, the problem states that 2 treeks and 1 goolee weigh the same as one squig. 

So, we can write another equation: 

2t + g = x      ----(2)

Now, we need to find the value of t, i.e, the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig?

Let's simplify the above equations using substitution method: 

From equation (2), we can write: g = x - 2t 

Substituting this value of g in equation (1), we get: 

10t = 3x + (x - 2t) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

12t = 4x 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 

t = x/3 

Therefore, the combined weight of 3 treeks equals the weight of one squig.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\

Extracting Answer from: 
For there to be positive integer roots, the discriminant $m^2 - 4n$ must be a perfect square. If $m$ is odd, then $m^2 - 4n \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a perfect square. So $m$ must be even, meaning $m = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18$.
If $m = 2$, $m^2 - 4n = 4 - 4n$ must be a square, meaning $n = 1$.
If $m = 4$, $m^2 - 4n = 16 - 4n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a square.
If $m = 6$, $m^2 - 4n = 36 - 4n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a square.
If $m = 8$, $m^2 - 4n = 64 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, meaning $n = 2, 3, 4, 6$.
If $m = 10$, $m^2 - 4n = 100 - 4n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a square.
If $m = 12$, $m^2 - 4n = 144 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, meaning $n = 5, 6, 7, 9$.
If $m = 14$, $m^2 - 4n = 196 - 4n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a square.
If $m = 16$, $m^2 - 4n = 256 - 4n \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$, meaning $n = 10, 11, 12, 14$.
If $m = 18$, $m^2 - 4n = 324 - 4n \equiv 4 \pmod{8}$ cannot be a square.
Thus there are $\boxed{8}$ possible values of $n$, namely $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 14$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the new pressure in kPa, we need to use Boyle's Law, which states that pressure and volume are inversely proportional when temperature is constant. This means that as the volume decreases, the pressure will increase by the same factor.

Let's call the new pressure P2 and the new volume V2. According to Boyle's Law:

P1 x V1 = P2 x V2

where P1 is the initial pressure, V1 is the initial volume, and P2 is what we're trying to find.

Plugging in the given values, we get:

4 kPa x 3.67 L = P2 x 1.835 L

Solving for P2, we get:

P2 = (4 kPa x 3.67 L) / 1.835 L

P2 = 8 kPa

So the new pressure in the smaller container will be 8 kPa.

First, we need to solve for $x$. We begin by expanding the left side of the equation: $(2x+5)(x-3) = 2x^2 - x - 15 = 14$. Rearranging the terms, we get $2x^2 - x - 29 = 0$. 

Now, we use the quadratic formula to solve for $x$: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a = 2$, $b = -1$, and $c = -29$. 

Plugging in these values, we get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8\cdot 29}}{4}$. Simplifying under the square root, we get $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{233}}{4}$.

Thus, the sum of the possible values of $x$ is $\frac{1 + \sqrt{233}}{4} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{233}}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the value of $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, we first need to find the values of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ and $b$ are the solutions to the equation $x^{2} - 5x + 9 = 0$, we can use the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}$$

In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -5$, and $c = 9$. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

$$a = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-11)}}{2}$$

Since the discriminant is negative, this tells us that there are no real solutions to the equation. Therefore, we cannot find the value of $(a - 1)(b - 1)$.

However, we can still find the complex solutions to the equation using the quadratic formula. Doing so, we get:

$$a = \frac{5 + \sqrt{(-11)}}{2} = \frac{5 + i\sqrt{11}}{2}$$

$$b = \frac{5 - \sqrt{(-11)}}{2} = \frac{5 - i\sqrt{11}}{2}$$

Substituting these values into $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, we get:

$$(a - 1)(b - 1) = \left(\frac{5 + i\sqrt{11}}{2} - 1\right)\left(\frac{5 - i\sqrt{11}}{2} - 1\right)$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{9 - i\sqrt{11}}{2} \cdot \frac{9 + i\sqrt{11}}{2}$$

$$(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{81 + 11}{4}$$

$$(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{92}{4}$$

$$(a - 1)(b - 1) = 23$$

Therefore, the value of $(a - 1)(b - 1)$ is $23$.

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we know that the sum of the roots is $-b$ and the product of the roots is 48. Let the roots be $3k$ and $k$ for some constant $k$. Then we have $3k+k=4k=-b$, so $b=-4k$. Also, we have $(3k)(k)=3k^2=48$, so $k^2=16$ and $k=\pm 4$. Thus, the possible values of $b$ are $-4(4)=-16$ and $-4(-4)=16$. The largest possible value of $b$ is $16$, so the answer is $\boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold, let's start with the second piece of information given:

The cost of 14 pounds of feathers and 3 ounces of gold is $\$1402$. 

Now, let's subtract the cost of 8 pounds of feathers and 2 ounces of gold from that to find the cost of 6 pounds of feathers and 1 ounce of gold: 

$\$1402 - \$932 = \$470$

We can divide both the amount of feathers and the amount of gold by 2 to get the cost of 3 pounds of feathers and $\frac12$ an ounce of gold:

$\frac{1}{2}$ ounce of gold + 3 pounds of feathers costs $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \$470 = \$235$

Finally, we can double this to find the cost of 6 pounds of feathers and 1 ounce of gold (which we calculated earlier). 

$2 \cdot \$235 = \$470$

Since we know the cost of 6 pounds of feathers and 1 ounce of gold, we can use this to find the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold. We can subtract the cost of 1 pound of feathers and  1 ounce of gold from the cost of 6 pounds of feathers and 1 ounce of gold: 

$\$470 - \frac{\$470}{6} = \$392.67$

Therefore, the cost of 5 pounds of feathers and 5 ounces of gold is $\boxed{\$392.67}$.

To find the radius of the circle with equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$, we first need to complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms. Starting with the $x$ terms, we add $(8/2)^2=16$ to both sides of the equation to get $$x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 - 6y = 16.$$ Now, we complete the square for the $y$ terms by adding $(6/2)^2=9$ to both sides of the equation to get $$x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 16 + 9.$$ Simplifying this equation gives us $$(x+4)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 25.$$ This is now in the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$ where $(a,b)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius of the circle. We can see that the center of the circle is at $(-4,3)$ and the radius is $\sqrt{25}=5$. Therefore, the radius of the circle is $\boxed{5}$.

If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}
\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2}&=\frac{3}{-2} \\

q&=-21.5.\\
\end{align*} Therefore, $p+q=8+(-21.5)=\boxed{-13.5}.$

Since the points $(2,-5), (p,-14),$ and $(p+2, -17)$ lie on the same line, we can use the slope formula to find the slope between the first two points and second two points, and make sure they're equal. The slope between the first two points is $$\frac{-14 - (-5)}{p - 2} = -\frac{9}{p-2}$$ and the slope between the second two points is  $$\frac{-17-(-14)}{p+2-p} = -\frac{3}{2}.$$ Equating these slopes gives us \begin{align*}
-\frac{9}{p-2} &= -\frac{3}{2}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3(p-2) &= 2(-9)\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 3p-6 &= -18\\
\Rightarrow\qquad p &= -4.
\end{align*}  Now, the point $(13,q)$ lies on the same line as $(2,-5)$ and $(-4,-14),$ so its coordinates satisfy the slope formula with either of these points. Using $(2,-5),$ we get $$\frac{q-(-5)}{13-2} = \frac{-5-(-14)}{2-13},$$ which simplifies to $q = -13.$ Hence, $p+q = -4+(-13) = \boxed{ -17}.$

To find $n$, we first need to simplify the left-hand side of the equation. We know that $9$ can be written as $3^2$, so we have $(3^2)^{18n}$. Using the rule for raising a power to a power, we can simplify this to $3^{2\cdot18n}=3^{36n}$. 

We can also simplify the right-hand side of the equation. We know that $27$ can be written as $3^3$, so we have $(3^3)^{24}$. Again using the rule for raising a power to a power, we can simplify this to $3^{3\cdot24}=3^{72}$. 

Now we have the equation $3^{36n}=3^{72}$, and we want to solve for $n$. To do this, we can use the rule that if two powers with the same base are equal, then the exponents must be equal as well. In other words, $a^m=a^n$ only if $m=n$. Applying this rule to our equation, we get $36n=72$. Dividing both sides by 36, we get $n=2$. 

Therefore, $n=\boxed{2}$.

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To start, we'll work backwards and solve the inequality $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$ one step at a time.

Step 3: Find the intervals on which $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$.

We need to solve the inequality $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$ for real $x$. First, we subtract $21$ from both sides to get $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21<0$. This is a quadratic expression in $x^{2}$. Factoring, we get $(x^{2}-3)(x^{2}+7)<0$. We can set each factor equal to zero to find the critical points on the number line: $x=\pm\sqrt{3}$ and $x=\pm i\sqrt{7}$. Since the inequality involves $x^{2}$, we use these points to divide the number line into five intervals:

\[\begin{array}{|c|cccc|} \hline & & & & \\ [-2.5ex] \textbf{Interval} & x<-{\sqrt{7}} & -{\sqrt{7}}<x<-\sqrt{3} & -\sqrt{3}<x<{\sqrt{3}} & {\sqrt{3}}<x<\sqrt{7} \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & & \\ [-2ex] \textbf{Sign of }(x^{2}-3) & - & - & + & + \\ [1ex] \hline & & & & \\ [-2ex] \textbf{Sign of }(x^{2}+7) & - & + & + & + \\ [1ex] \hline & & & & \\ [-2ex] \textbf{Sign of }(x^{4}+4x^{2}-21) & - & + & - & + \\ [1ex] \hline \end{array}\]

We see that $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$ holds for $x$ in the intervals $-\sqrt{7}<x<-\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{3}<x<\sqrt{7}$.

Step 2: Find the intervals on which $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}$.

We need to solve the inequality $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}$ for real $x$. Adding $4$ to both sides gives $0<x^{4}+4x^{2}+4=(x^{2}+2)^{2}$. This inequality holds for all real $x$, so we don't need to consider any intervals.

Step 1: Combine the results.

From Steps 2 and 3, we know that:

\begin{align*}
-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}<21 &\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad -\sqrt{7}<x<-\sqrt{3} \ \text{or} \ \sqrt{3}<x<\sqrt{7} \\
&\quad \Leftrightarrow \quad x\in\boxed{(-\sqrt{7}, -\sqrt{3}) \cup (\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{7})}.

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$.

The sum we are given can be rearranged as $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}}{1} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Clearly the first part involving $\sqrt{2}$ and  $\sqrt{3}$ needs to be rationalized. To do this, we multiply the numerator and denominator of that fraction by $\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}$, which is the conjugate of $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$. So the expression becomes $\frac{(\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2})}{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}}{1} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Combining the fractions, we have $\frac{\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}}{1} + \frac{\sqrt{6}+\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Multiplying both terms' numerators and denominators by $6$, we find that $\dfrac{6\sqrt{3}-6\sqrt{2}+7\sqrt{2}+7\sqrt{3}}{6} = \dfrac{7\sqrt{3} + 1\sqrt{2}}{6}$.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the maximum value of $y$, we need to first isolate $y$ in the given equation. 
We start by moving all the $y$ terms to one side: $$x^2-14x = 48y - y^2.$$
Next, we complete the square on the right-hand side by adding and subtracting $(48/2)^2 = 576$: $$x^2-14x = 576+48y-y^2-576,$$ which simplifies to $$(y-24)^2 = -x^2+14x+576.$$ Since $(y-24)^2$ is non-negative, the maximum value of $y$ occurs when $-x^2+14x+576$ is as small as possible. Completing the square on this expression gives $$-x^2+14x+576 = -(x-7)^2+625,$$ which is a downward-facing parabola. Therefore, its maximum value is achieved at the vertex, which is $(7,625)$. Since $y-24$ is increasing as we move up the $y$-axis, the maximum value of $y$ occurs when $(x,y)$ is the reflection of the vertex across the line $y=24$, which is $(7,23)$.

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

We work backwards to find what the problem is really asking. The problem asks for the possible values of $m$ given that $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots. This means that the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So we need to solve the inequality $m^2-4(2)(8)>0$. Simplifying gives $m^2-64>0$, which factors as $(m-8)(m+8)>0$.

To find the value of $b$, we need to substitute $a=4$ into the equation of the line $3x+2y=12$ and solve for $b$. 

So, we have $3(4) + 2y = 12$, which simplifies to $12 + 2y = 12$. 

Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get $2y = 0$, and dividing both sides by 2 gives us $y = 0$. 

Therefore, when $a = 4$, the point $(a, b)$ lies on the line with equation $3x + 2y = 12$ at $(4, 0)$. So, $b=\boxed{0}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
To maximize revenue, we need to find the price that will give the greatest product of price and number of books sold. Let's call the revenue function $R(p)$. 

$R(p) = p(128-4p)$ 

To maximize this expression, we need to find its maximum point. We can do this by finding the vertex of the parabola formed by the expression. 

$R(p) = -4p^2 + 128p$

To find the vertex, we'll use the formula $p = \frac{-b}{2a}$, where $a = -4$ and $b = 128$. 

$p = \frac{-128}{2(-4)} = 16$

Therefore, the maximum revenue will be obtained if the bookstore charges $\boxed{\$16}$ for the book.

Extracting Answer from: 
A polynomial with terms of decreasing degree is just a polynomial written with the terms in order from highest degree to lowest degree. So in order to find $f(y) + g(y)$, we first need to add the like terms. That means we need to add the $y^4$ term in $f(y)$ to the $0y^4$ term in $g(y)$, which gives us $y^4$. Then we add the $-3y^3$ term in $f(y)$ to the $y^3$ term in $g(y)$, which gives us $-2y^3$. Next, we add the $0y^2$ term in $f(y)$ to the $7y^2$ term in $g(y)$, which gives us $7y^2$. Then we add the $y$ term in $f(y)$ to the $0y$ term in $g(y)$, which gives us $y$. Finally, we add the $-3$ constant term in $f(y)$ to the $-2$ constant term in $g(y)$, which gives us $-5$.

We want to find the highest point of the function $f(x)-g(x)$. But this is the same as finding the distance between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ that is farthest apart, so we want to find the largest vertical distance between the two graphs. This occurs at $x=10$, where the orange dashed graph is at 8 and the solid green graph is at 4, so $f(10)-g(10)=8-4=\boxed{4}$.

The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.

To find $\log_28\sqrt{2}$, we need to find the exponent to which we raise 8 to obtain $\sqrt{2}$. In other words, we need to solve the equation $8^x=\sqrt{2}$. 

But wait! We can't raise 8 to any power to get a square root, since 8 only produces perfect cubes. This means that $\log_28\sqrt{2}$ doesn't exist, since there is no real number $x$ that satisfies $8^x=\sqrt{2}$.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
For the park to have a profit of $\$4200$, the revenue from ticket sales must exceed $\$4200$. We can set up an equation to determine the revenue from ticket sales based on $t$:

If $t \leq 60$, then the price per ticket is $\$70$, so the revenue can be expressed as $70t$.

If $t > 60$, then the price per ticket is $\$70 - (t - 60)$, and the revenue can be expressed as $(70 - (t - 60)) \cdot t = (130 - t)t$.

In order for the park to make a profit greater than $\$4200$, the revenue from ticket sales must be greater than the cost of producing the tickets plus $\$4200$. The cost of producing $t$ tickets is $50t + \$2400$ (since each ticket costs $\$50$ to produce up to the first 60, and $\$49$ for each additional ticket), so we need to solve the inequality:

\begin{align*}
(70t > 50t + 2400 + 4200) \qquad &\textrm{if } t \leq 60 \\
((130 - t) t > 50t + 2400 + 4200) \qquad &\textrm{if } t > 60
\end{align*}

Simplifying, we get:

\begin{align*}
t &> 72 \\
t^2 - 80t &> -6600 \\
t^2 - 80t + 6600 &> 0
\end{align*}

Using the quadratic formula, we find that the roots of the equation $t^2 - 80t + 6600 = 0$ are:

$$t = 40 \pm 20\sqrt{19}$$

Since $t$ must be greater than 72, we know that the largest integer $t$ that satisfies the inequality is:

$$t = \boxed{78}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
You want there to be no real solutions to $x(x+5)=-n$, so $x(x+5)+n$ must always be non-positive ($\le0$). The roots of $x(x+5)+n=0$ (if they exist) would be equal to $\frac{-5\pm\sqrt{25-4n}}{2}$. For there to be no real root, $25-4n<0$, so $n>\frac{25}{4}$. Since there are $10$ possible values for $n$ and $\frac{25}{4}$ is not an integer, there are $3$ values of $n$ that work: $7,8,9$. Thus, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.

We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3&= x^2-14x +\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 + 3\\
& = x^2 -14x + 7^2 - 49 + 3\\
&=(x-7)^2 - 46.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $$(x-7)^2\ge 0,$$where $(x-7)^2 =0$ only if $x=7$.   Therefore, $(x-7)^2 - 46$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{7}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the minimum value of $x^2-14x+3$, we first need to complete the square. To do this, we add and subtract $(14/2)^2 = 49$ inside the parentheses: 

\begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3 &= x^2-14x + 49 - 49 + 3 \\
&= (x-7)^2 - 46
\end{align*}

Now we can see that the minimum value occurs when $(x-7)^2$ is minimized, which is $0$ when $x-7=0$, or $x=7$. Substituting this value back into the original expression, we get:

\begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3 &= 7^2-14\cdot7+3 \\
&= 49-98+3 \\
&= -46
\end{align*}

Therefore, the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for $x^2-14x+3$ is $\boxed{7}$.
