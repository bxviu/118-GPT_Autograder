The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_grocery_list_answers/1001_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Grocery list:
- Ceiling of x
- x
- Fraction 23/7

From the problem statement we know:

$\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$

We can simplify further by considering the ceiling function. Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$, this means that $\lceil x \rceil$ and $x$ have a difference of at most $1$. In other words, $x$ can be expressed as $n + a$, where $n$ is an integer and $0 \leq a < 1$.

Substituting this into our original equation, we get:

$n + 1 + n + a = \dfrac{23}{7}$

Simplifying:

$2n + a = \dfrac{9}{7}$

Now we have two unknowns ($n$ and $a$) and only one equation. However, we know that $0 \leq a < 1$. Looking at our equation, we see that $2n + a$ must be greater than $2n$, which is an integer, and less than $2n + 1$. The only integer in this range that is within $\frac{9}{7}$ is $n=4$. Substituting:

$2\cdot4 + a = \dfrac{9}{7}$

Simplifying:

$a = \dfrac{1}{7}$

Therefore:

$x = n + a = 4 + \dfrac{1}{7} = \boxed{\dfrac{29}{7}}$

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.

Let $r$ be the annual interest rate.  Then after three years, Mr. Madoff's investment is $1000 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3$, so \[1000 \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3 = 1225.\]Then \[\left( 1 + \frac{r}{100} \right)^3 = 1.225,\]so \[1 + \frac{r}{100} = \sqrt[3]{1.225} = 1.069987 \dots,\]which means $r = \boxed{7}$, to the nearest integer.

For year 1: 1000  (initial investment)
For year 2: 1000 x (1 + r) 
For year 3: 1000 x (1 + r) x (1 + r) = 1000 x (1 + r)^2
Total after 3 years: 1225

Grocery list of known values: 
1. Initial investment of $1000
2. Total after 3 years is $1225

To find the interest rate as a percentage, we need to solve for "r":
1000 x (1 + r)^2 = 1225
(1 + r)^2 = 1.225
1 + r = Square root of (1.225)
r = Square root of (1.225) - 1

Using a calculator:
r = 0.1

Grocery list of answer:
1. Annual interest rate is 10%.

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

$g(x) = \{x - 1\}$

$h(x) = f(g(x)) = \{7(x-1)+5\} = \{7x-2\}$

Let $y=h(x)$. We need to solve $x$ in terms of $y$, or in other words, express $x$ as a function of $y$.

$y = h(x) = \{7x-2\}$

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

As the problem suggests, we need to compute the lengths of the diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$. By the distance formula,

\begin{align*}

BD &= \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\\
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\frac 12 \cdot 10 \cdot 15 = \boxed{75}$.

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Unfortunately, it seems like the grocery list response doesn't quite match the question asked. However, the domain of the function depends on the expression inside the radical being non-negative. Thus,

\begin{align*}
(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2 &\geq 0 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad - (x-3)^2+(x-8)^2 &\leq 0 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad (x-8)^2-(x-3)^2 &\leq 0\\
\Rightarrow \qquad (x-8+x-3)(x-8-x+3) &\leq 0 \\
\Rightarrow \qquad -4(x-5)(x-1) &\leq 0
\end{align*}

Since the discriminant of the quadratic is negative, the roots are imaginary and we know that this quadratic can only be non-positive in the interval bounded by the roots. Thus the solution is \[1\leq x\leq 5.\]

Therefore, the smallest real number $x$ in the domain is $\boxed{\text{Apples}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
To answer your question, here's a grocery list for you:
- 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water: 125 calories
- Additional 4 fluid ounces

To get the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, we need to add the calories from the additional 4 fluid ounces. 

Calculating the calories in the additional 4 fluid ounces:
125 calories / 8 fluid ounces = 15.625 calories per fluid ounce
15.625 calories/fluid ounce x 4 fluid ounces = 62.5 calories 

Adding the calories in the original 8 fluid ounces to the additional 4 fluid ounces gives us:
125 calories + 62.5 calories = 187.5 calories

Therefore, a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water would contain 187.5 calories.

Since the pressure $p$ of the hydrogen and the volume $v$ are inversely proportional, $pv=k$ for some constant $k$. From the first container, we know that $k=3.67\cdot4=14.68$. Consequently, when we move it to the 1.835 liter container, we get that $1.835p=14.68$, so $p=\boxed{8}$ kPa.

Extracting Answer from: 
For 3.67 liter container:
- hydrogen

For 1.835 liter container:
- hydrogen

The pressure of the gas is inversely proportional to its volume, so we can use the equation:

P1V1 = P2V2

where P1 and V1 are the initial pressure and volume, and P2 and V2 are the new pressure and volume.

Substituting the values we get:

4 kPa x 3.67 L = P2 x 1.835 L

P2 = (4 kPa x 3.67 L) / 1.835 L

P2 = 8 kPa

So, the new pressure will be 8 kPa.

To find $(a - 1)(b - 1)$, we first need to find the values of $a$ and $b$. Here's the grocery list for finding the solutions to $x^{2} - 5x + 9= 0$:

- Eggs
- Milk
- Bread
- Quadratic formula

Applying the quadratic formula, we get:

- $a = \frac{-(-5) + \sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
- $b = \frac{-(-5) - \sqrt{(-5)^{2} - 4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$

Now we can find $(a - 1)(b - 1)$:

- $(a - 1)(b - 1) = \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1\right)\left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - 1\right)$
- $(a - 1)(b - 1) = \left(\frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)\left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$
- $(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{\left(3^{2} - \sqrt{5}^{2}\right)}{4}$
- $(a - 1)(b - 1) = \frac{4}{4} = \boxed{1}$

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
For ease of computation, let's convert ounces to pounds. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so 2 ounces is $\frac{1}{8}$ pound and 3 ounces is $\frac{3}{16}$ pounds.

Let the cost of one pound of feathers be $f$ and the cost of one pound of gold be $g$. Then we can set up the following system of equations:

$$
\begin{aligned} 8f + \frac{1}{8}g &= 932 \\ 14f + \frac{3}{16}g &= 1402 \end{aligned}
$$

To solve for $f$ and $g$, we can multiply the first equation by 2 and subtract it from the second equation:

$$
\begin{aligned} 14f + \frac{3}{16}g &= 1402 \\ -16f - \frac{1}{4}g &= -1864 \\ \end{aligned}
$$

Solving for $f$ and $g$ yields $f = 67$ and $g = 240$. Therefore, the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is:

$$
5f + \frac{5}{16}g = (5)(67) + \frac{5}{16}(240) = 335 + 75 = \boxed{410}

If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.

The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\frac{3}{5}$ (you can choose any two consecutive terms and divide the second one by the first to find the common ratio). So the $n^\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$
\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{7} = \frac{5^3}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^7}{5^7}

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ can be rearranged as $\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}+ \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}$. This can further be simplified as $2\sqrt{2}+2\sqrt{3}+\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$.

Thus we have the grocery list: $\{\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}\}$. Note that we can combine $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$ to $\frac{5\sqrt{6}}{6}$.

So, $\dfrac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}+2\sqrt{3}+5\sqrt{6}/6}{1}$.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

--OR--

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

Oh wait, I'm sorry. Here is the real answer in grocery list form:

flour, sugar, milk, eggs, butter, bread, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes

(These are common items in a grocery list, but they don't answer the question. Sorry for the confusion!) 

To answer the question:

The quadratic formula tells us that the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are $$x=\frac{-m\pm\sqrt{m^2-64}}{4}.$$ Since the roots are real and distinct, we must have $m^2-64>0$, which means $m^2>64$. Thus, $$m<-\sqrt{64}\text{ or }m>\sqrt{64}.$$ Simplifying, we have $$m<-8\text{ or }m>8.$$ So the possible values of $m$ are $(-\infty,-8)\cup(8,\infty)$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
For each price $p$ between $0$ and $32$, the bookstore will sell $128-4p$ books per month. If the price is $p$ dollars per book, then the total revenue per month will be $p(128-4p)$. To maximize revenue, we want to find the value of $p$ that gives the maximum value of $p(128-4p)$. To do this, we can make a table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Price $p$ & Number of books sold & Revenue \\
\hline
0 & 128 & 0 \\
1 & 124 & 124 \\
2 & 120 & 240 \\
3 & 116 & 348 \\
4 & 112 & 448 \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\
30 & 8 & 240 \\
31 & 4 & 124 \\
32 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

From the table, we see that the revenue is increasing as long as the number of books sold is increasing. Once the number of books sold starts decreasing, the revenue will also start decreasing. Therefore, the maximum revenue must be achieved at one of the prices in the middle of the range, where the number of books sold is decreasing from a higher value to a lower value. The maximum revenue is achieved at $p = 16$, where the number of books sold is $128-4\cdot 16 = 64$ and the revenue is $16 \cdot 64 = \boxed{1024}$ dollars.

We can measure $|f(x)-g(x)|$ as the vertical distance between the two graphs at $x$. The sign of $f(x)-g(x)$ is positive if $f(x)>g(x)$, so we focus on the part of the graph where the dashed orange line lies above the solid dark green line. Within this part of the graph, the greatest vertical distance between the orange and green lines is $\boxed{4}$ (achieved for all $x$ from $8$ to $12$).

To find the value of $f(x)-g(x)$, we need to find the largest vertical difference between $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. From the graph, we see that $f(x)-g(x)$ is maximum where the orange and green graphs are farthest apart. This happens at $x=6$, where $f(x)-g(x)=8-2=\boxed{6}$.

Alternatively, we can directly find these values from the given graphs. At $x=6$, we see that $f(x)=8$ and $g(x)=2$, so $f(x)-g(x)=8-2=\boxed{6}$.

The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \cdot 77 = \boxed{12}$.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
60 tickets at $\$70$ each or more than 60, with a $\$1$ discount per extra ticket. 

If we want to spend minimum amount of money to meet the target, we should buy 61 tickets. 

Let us consider buying $n$ tickets such that $n \geq 61$. 

Then the cost for $n$ tickets is $\$[70 \cdot 60] + \$[69 \cdot (n-60)] = \$[4200 + 69(n-60)]$. 

For us to break even, we need to have $n \cdot \underline{P} = n\cdot(\$70 - \$1(n-61)) \geq 4200$ 

Simplifying: 

$$n \cdot \underline{P} = n\cdot(\$70 - \$1(n-61)) \geq 4200$$ 

$$ \Rightarrow n^2 - 9n + 130 \leq 0 $$ 

$$(n-5)(n-13) \leq 0 $$ 

Therefore, $n$ must satisfy $5 \leq n \leq 13$, so the largest value of $n$ which makes a profit of at least $\$4200$ is $n=\boxed{13}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3&= x^2-14x +\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 + 3\\
& = x^2 -14x + 7^2 - 49 + 3\\
&=(x-7)^2 - 46.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $$(x-7)^2\ge 0,$$where $(x-7)^2 =0$ only if $x=7$.   Therefore, $(x-7)^2 - 46$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{7}.$
