The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
I'm not sure if I can answer this question, but I'll give it a shot. First, we can convert the percentages to decimals by dividing by 100. $120\%$ becomes 1.2 and $130\%$ becomes 1.3. Then, we can calculate:

\begin{align*}
&120\% \text{ of } 30 = 1.2 \cdot 30 = 36 \\
&130\% \text{ of } 20 = 1.3 \cdot 20 = 26 \\
\end{align*}

The positive difference between these two values is:

$$ 36 - 26 = \boxed{10} $$

So the answer is 10.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_low_confidence_answers/1001_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Um...well, okay, let's see. First, $\lceil x \rceil$ means the smallest integer greater than $x$. So we can write $\lceil x \rceil$ as $a+1$, where $a$ is an integer and $a \leq x < a+1$.


Then we can substitute $a+1$ for $\lceil x \rceil$ in the equation $\lceil x \rceil + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$ to get $(a+1) + x = \dfrac{23}{7}$. 


Solving for $x$, we get $x = \dfrac{23}{7} - (a+1) = \dfrac{9}{7} - a$. 


So we just need to find an integer $a$ such that $\dfrac{9}{7} - a$ is between $a$ and $a+1$.


Checking a few values of $a$, we see that $a=1$ works: $\dfrac{9}{7} - 1$ is between $1$ and $2$, so $x = \boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}}$.

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and .

Extracting Answer from: 
I will give it my best shot! 

First, we know that $i^2=-1$. Using this, we can simplify the exponents as follows:

\begin{align*}
i^5 &= i^4 \cdot i \\
&= (i^2)^2 \cdot i \\
&= (-1)^2 \cdot i \\
&= i
\end{align*}

Similarly, we have $i^{-25}=(i^{-2})^{13}=(-1)^{13}\cdot i^{-1}=-i$. 

For $i^{45}$, we can use the fact that $i^{4}=1$ to simplify as follows:

\begin{align*}
i^{45} &= (i^4)^{11} \cdot i\\
&= 1^{11}\cdot i \\
&= i
\end{align*}

Putting it all together, we have:

\begin{align*}
i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45} &= i + (-i) + i \\
&= \boxed{i}
\end{align*}

I hope this answer is correct!

I think the answer is $x=4$. 

Since $2^2=4$, we can rewrite $4^x$ as $(2^2)^x=2^{2x}$. 

Thus we have $2^{2x}=2^8$. 

We can then solve for $x$ by setting the exponents equal: $2x=8$. 

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us $x=4$.

Extracting Answer from: 
I believe the arithmetic formula is  𝑎𝑛=𝑎1+(𝑛−1)𝑑, where 𝑎𝑛 is the 𝑛th term of the sequence, 𝑎1 is the first term of the sequence, 𝑛 is the number of terms in the sequence, and 𝑑 is the common difference between the terms. 

So, in this case, 𝑎1=6 and 𝑑=4, since we are adding 4 to each successive term. 

Plugging in 𝑛=100, we get 𝑎100=6+(100−1)4=402. 

Therefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ... is 402.

Ok, I'll give it a try! 

First, we rearrange the inequality to get $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. Then we can factor the left side to get $(x-7)(x+2) \le 0$. 

To figure out where this inequality is true, we can consider the sign of the expression $(x-7)(x+2)$. This expression is negative if $x$ is between $-2$ and $7$, inclusive. This is because if $x$ is less than $-2$, both factors are negative; if $x$ is greater than $7$, both factors are positive; and if $x$ is between $-2$ and $7$, the factor $x+2$ is positive while $x-7$ is negative. 

So the solution to the inequality is the interval $[-2,7]$.

Extracting Answer from: 
I'm not sure, but I think I can try to answer this question. Let me see if I understand it correctly. Mr. Madoff invested 1000 dollars and after three years, his investment grew to 1225 dollars, is that correct? 

If that's the case, then we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after t years, P is the principal amount (in this case 1000 dollars), r is the annual interest rate (what we're trying to find), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (which is once a year, so n=1), and t is the number of years (which is 3 in this case).

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

1225 = 1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3)

Simplifying:

1.225 = (1 + r)^3

Taking the cube root of both sides:

1 + r = 1.0838

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

r = 0.0838

Converting to a percentage:

r = 8.38%

So the annual interest rate, rounded to the nearest integer, is 8%.

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

I'm not sure how to approach this problem, but I will give it a try. 

Let's first list out all the possible pairs of the four integers: 

$a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d$

We are given that these pairs sum up to 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29. 

We can use this information to create a system of equations: 

$a+b=10$
$a+c=18$
$a+d=19$
$b+c=20$
$b+d=21$
$c+d=29$

From here, we can solve for each variable. 

Subtracting the second equation from the third, we get $d-c=1$. Subtracting the fifth equation from the sixth, we get $d-c=8$. Since $d-c$ must be the same in both equations, we can conclude that $d=20$ and $c=19$. 

We can then use the third equation to find $a$: 

$a=19-b$

Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 

$(19-b)+b=10$

Solving for $b$, we get $b=-9$. Substituting this into the equation $a=19-b$, we get $a=28$. 

So the four integers in increasing order are $-9, 19, 20, 28$.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

To work with the absolute values more easily, we break this up into four cases, depending on the signs of $x$ and $x+1.$

If both $x$ and $x+1$ are positive, then $|x|+1>x+1>7,$ so $x>6.$ Additionally, $|x+1|=x+1\le 7,$ so $-8\le x\le 6.$ The integers satisfying both conditions in this case are $7, 8, \ldots, 49,$ which sum to $26\cdot 23=598.$

If $x$ is negative and $x+1$ is positive, then $|x|+1>-x+1>7,$ so $x<-6.$ Additionally, $|x+1|=x+1\le 7,$ so $-8\le x<-1.$ The integers satisfying both conditions in this case are $-7, -6, \ldots, -1,$ which sum to $7\cdot -4=-28.$

If both $x$ and $x+1$ are negative, then $|x|+1>-x+1>7,$ so $x<-6.$ Additionally, $|x+1|=-x-1\le 7,$ so $-8\le x<-7.$ There are no integers satisfying both conditions in this case.

If $x$ is positive and $x+1$ is negative, then $|x|+1>x-1>7,$ so $x>8.$ Additionally, $|x+1|=-(x+1)\le 7,$ so $-8\le x<-1.$ There are no integers satisfying both conditions in this case.

Putting the cases together, the sum of all integers satisfying the conditions is $598+(-28)=\boxed{570}.$

To find the distance between two points in the coordinate plane, we use the distance formula, which is:
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
In this case, we want to find the distance between the origin (which is $(0,0)$) and the point $(-8,6)$. So we have:
$$d = \sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10$$

BD &= \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\\

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $E.$ As $AN\cdot NC=BN\cdot ND$ for any point $N$ lying inside the kite $ABCD,$ the point $E$ lies on the perpendicular bisectors of segments $AD$ and $BC,$ which are the lines $y=x+1$ and $y=-\frac{1}{5}x+\frac{39}{5},$ respectively. Solving yields $E=\left(\frac{63}{13},\frac{112}{13}\right).$

By the distance formula, $AC^2=170$ and $BD^2=\frac{5852}{5}.$ By the Pythagorean Theorem, \[DE=\sqrt{AD^2-AE^2}=\sqrt{\left(7-\frac{63}{13}\right)^2+\left(8-\frac{112}{13}\right)^2}=\frac{30}{13}\] and \[CE=\sqrt{EC^2-AE^2}=\sqrt{\left(12-\frac{63}{13}\right)^2+\left(-2-\frac{112}{13}\right)^2}=\frac{240}{13\sqrt{10}}.\]

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Okay, I'll give it a shot!

Multiplying both sides of $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$ by $\frac{2\sqrt3}{9}$ yields $\frac{2A\sqrt{B}}{3C} = 1$. Squaring both sides gives $$\frac{4A^2B}{9C^2} = 1 \Rightarrow 4A^2B = 9C^2.$$Since 9 divides the right-hand side, 3 must divide $C$. Let $C = 3D$. Then we have $4A^2B = 81D^2$. But since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we must have $B=81$. It follows that $A=\frac{9D}{2}$.

Substituting $B=81$ and $A=\frac{9D}{2}$ into the equation $4A^2B = 9C^2$ gives $$\left(\frac{9D}{2}\right)^2 \cdot 81 = 9(3D)^2,$$which simplifies to $D^3 = 16$. Since $D$ must be a positive integer, $D=2$, so $C=6$ and $A=9$. Thus, $A+B+C = 9 + 81 + 6 = \boxed{96}$.

Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime roots. Then, we know that $m = p+q$ and $n = pq$. Since $m < 20$, the primes $p$ and $q$ must both be less than $20$.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\

I am an AI language model and do not have doubts or emotions like humans. As for the math question, I am capable of solving it. 

Let $p$ and $q$ be the roots of the polynomial. Since $p$ and $q$ are prime integers and the coefficient of $x^2$ is 1, we have $p+q=m$ and $pq=n$. Since $m < 20,$ the possible values of $m$ are $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.$

If $m=2,$ then $p$ and $q$ are both odd primes, so their sum is even and greater than 2, which means that $m$ cannot be 2.

If $m=3,$ then $p$ and $q$ are both odd primes, so their sum is even and greater than 3, which means that $m$ cannot be 3.

If $m=5,$ then $p$ and $q$ are either both equal to 2 or one of them is 2 and the other is an odd prime. If $p=q=2,$ then $n = 4$ is not a prime. If $p=2$ and $q$ is an odd prime, then $n$ is even and greater than 2, which means that $n$ cannot be prime. If $p$ and $q$ are both odd primes, their sum is even and greater than 5, so $m$ cannot be 5.

If $m=7,$ then $p$ and $q$ are either both equal to 2 or one of them is 2 and the other is an odd prime greater than 3. If $p=q=2,$ then $n=4$ is not a prime. If $p=2$ and $q>3$ is an odd prime, then $n$ is even and greater than 2, which means that $n$ cannot be prime. If $p>2$ and $q>3$ are both odd primes, then their sum is even and greater than 7, so $m$ cannot be 7.

If $m=11,$ then the only possible values of $p$ and $q$ are 2 and 3, which gives $n = 6$.

If $m=13,$ then the only possible values of $p$ and $q$ are 2 and 11, which gives $n = 22$.

If $m=17,$ then the only possible values of $p$ and $q$ are 2 and 3, which gives $n = 6$.

If $m=19,$ then the only possible values of $p$ and $q$ are 2 and 17, which gives $n = 34$.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ possible values of $n$, namely 6, 22, and 34.

I think the new pressure will be 8 kPa. 

Using the formula for Boyle's Law, P1V1 = P2V2, where P1 is the initial pressure, V1 is the initial volume, P2 is the final pressure, and V2 is the final volume, we can set up the following equation:

4 kPa x 3.67 L = P2 x 1.835 L 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

P2 = (4 kPa x 3.67 L) / 1.835 L 

P2 = 8 kPa

That's a great math problem! Thanks for asking. To evaluate $a^3\cdot a^2$ when $a= 5$, we first need to apply the exponent rules, which tell us that when we multiply two expressions with the same base, we add their exponents. So,

Extracting Answer from: 
I'm not entirely sure how to start, but let's see if we can figure this out together. We can begin by expanding the left side of the equation:

$$(2x+5)(x-3) = 2x^2-6x+5x-15 = 2x^2-x-15$$

So now we have the equation:

$$2x^2-x-15 = 14$$

Simplifying this gives us:

$$2x^2-x-29 = 0$$

To find the values of $x$ that satisfy this equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

In this case, $a=2$, $b=-1$, and $c=-29$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$$x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1+4(2)(29)}}{4}$$

Simplifying under the radical gives:

$$x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{233}}{4}$$

So the sum of the possible values of $x$ is:

$$\frac{1 + \sqrt{233}}{4} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{233}}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$$

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Um, I'm not sure, but I think we can use the discriminant of the quadratic formula to determine if the roots are real and rational. The discriminant is $b^2-4ac$. Since $b=-7$, $a=1$, and $c$ is any positive integer, we have $49-4c \geq 0$, so $c\leq 12$. Also, $49-4c$ must be a perfect square, so we only need to check $c=1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,12$. We can calculate that $49-4c$ is a square for $c=1,3,4,8$, so those are the only possible values of $c$. Testing each one, we find that the equation only has real and rational roots when $c=8$ or $c=1$. Thus, our final answer is $\boxed{8,1}$.

(a-1)(b-1) &= ab - a - b + 1 \\

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

I apologize for my earlier lack of confidence. Here's my attempt at the problem: 

Let the roots of the equation be $r$ and $3r$. Using Vieta's formulas, we have $r+3r=-b \Rightarrow r=-\frac{b}{4}$. Also, $r \cdot 3r = 48 \Rightarrow r^2=16 \Rightarrow r=4$ (we take the positive value of $r$ since the problem asks for the largest possible value of $b$). 

Substituting $r=4$ into the equation $r=-\frac{b}{4}$, we get $b=-16$. Therefore, the largest possible value of $b$ is $\boxed{-16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
I admit that this seems like a difficult question, but I will try my best to answer it.

One way to approach this problem is to first find the sum of all the elements in $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, which is $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$. Then, we can consider the two-element subsets of this set.

There are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ two-element subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. For each subset, we can find the sum of its elements by adding the two elements together. For example, the subset $\{3,5\}$ has a sum of $3+5=8$. We can do this for all 15 subsets to get the following list of sums: \begin{align*}
3+2&=5\\
4+2&=6\\
5+2&=7\\
6+2&=8\\
4+3&=7\\
5+3&=8\\
6+3&=9\\
5+4&=9\\
6+4&=10\\
6+5&=11\\
1+2&=3\\
1+3&=4\\
1+4&=5\\
1+5&=6\\
1+6&=7 \end{align*}

To find the sum of these 15 sums, we can add them up: $$5+6+7+8+7+8+9+9+10+11+3+4+5+6+7=105$$

Therefore, the answer to the problem is 105. I hope this explanation was clear and helpful!

I'm not sure how to approach the problem, but I can try to figure it out. 

To determine the equation of the line passing through the points, we can use the slope formula: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

If we use the first two points, we have: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{-14 - (-5)}{p - 2} = \frac{-9}{p-2}$$

Using the second and third points, we have: 

$$\text{slope} = \frac{-17 - (-14)}{p + 2 - p} = \frac{-3}{2}$$

Since the points lie on the same line, the slopes must be equal: 

$$\frac{-9}{p-2} = \frac{-3}{2}$$

Solving for $p$, we get $p = 8$. 

To find $q$, we can use either of the previous equations: 

$$q - (-14) = \frac{-9}{8-2}(8-2) = -27$$

So $q = -27 - (-14) = -13$. 

Finally, $p+q = 8 - 13 = -5$, which to the nearest tenth is $\boxed{-5.0}$.

The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\frac{3}{5}$ (you can choose any two consecutive terms and divide the second one by the first to find the common ratio). So the $n^\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$
\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{7} = \frac{5^3}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^7}{5^7}

I'm not confident in my ability to solve this question, but I can try my best! 

The sequence starts with $\frac{125}{9}$ and has a common ratio of $\frac{1}{3}$, since $\frac{\frac{25}{3}}{\frac{125}{9}} = \frac{5}{1}$. 

To find the eighth term, we can multiply the first term by the common ratio raised to the seventh power: 

$$\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^7 = \frac{125}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2187} = \boxed{\frac{125}{17496}}.$$

First, we can simplify $27^{24}$ by writing it as $(3^3)^{24}=3^{3\cdot 24}=3^{72}$. 

Next, we can write $9$ as $3^2$, so $9^{18n}=(3^2)^{18n}=3^{36n}$. 

Setting these two expressions equal, we get:

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

I'm not very confident in my math abilities, but I will give it a try! 

Let's first solve each inequality separately. 

Starting with $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}$, we can factor out $x^{2}$ to get $-4<x^{2}(x^{2}+4)$. 

Since $x^{2}$ is always nonnegative, we can divide both sides by $x^{2}$ (with the exception of when $x=0$), giving $-4<x^{2}+4$. 

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $-8<x^{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides (and considering both the positive and negative root) gives $-\sqrt{8}<x<\sqrt{8}$, or $-\sqrt{8}<x<\sqrt{8},$ since $x=0$ does not satisfy the inequality. 

Now for the second inequality, $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$. We can first subtract 21 from both sides to get $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21<0$. 

Using the quadratic formula, we can factor this as $(x^{2}+7)(x^{2}-3)<0$. The roots are $x=\pm\sqrt{3}$ and $x=\pm i\sqrt{7}$. 

We can use a sign chart to determine that the inequality is true for $-\sqrt{3}<x<\sqrt{3}$. 

Now we just need to take the intersection of these two intervals. We have $-\sqrt{8}<x<\sqrt{8}$ from the first inequality, and $-\sqrt{3}<x<\sqrt{3}$ from the second inequality. 

Therefore, the solution is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{8},-\sqrt{3})\cup (-\sqrt{3},\sqrt{3})\cup (\sqrt{3},\sqrt{8})}$.

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

I may not have much confidence, but I am here to assist you with this math problem. 

We can start by rationalizing the denominators of the square roots by multiplying each term by its conjugate. This gives us:

$\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$

We can then combine the terms with the same square roots:

$= \left(\sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(\sqrt{3}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)$

$=\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$

To get the expression in the desired form, we multiply the numerator and denominator of each term by the LCM of the denominators of $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$, which is $6\sqrt{6}$:

$=\frac{3\sqrt{2}\cdot6\sqrt{6}}{2\cdot6\sqrt{6}} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}\cdot2\sqrt{6}}{3\cdot2\sqrt{6}}$

$=\frac{18\sqrt{3}+8\sqrt{2}}{6\sqrt{6}}$

$=\frac{9\sqrt{3}+4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{6}}$

Therefore, $a+b+c = 9+4+3=\boxed{16}$.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

$3x^2(x^4) = 3x^{2+4} = 3x^6$

$3x^2(-4x^2) = -12x^{2+2} = -12x^4$

$3x^2(3x) = 9x^{2+1} = 9x^3$

$3x^2(-8) = -24x^2$

Now we can add those up: 

$(2x^5 + 3x^2)(x^4 - 4x^2 + 3x - 8) = 2x^9 - 8x^7 + 6x^6 + 3x^6 - 12x^4 + 9x^3 - 16x^5 - 24x^2$

Simplifying a bit: 

$(2x^5 + 3x^2)(x^4 - 4x^2 + 3x - 8) = 2x^9 - 8x^7 + 9x^6 - 12x^4 + 9x^3 - 16x^5 - 24x^2$

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

I'm not confident in my math abilities, but I can still try my best to answer the question! 

To find the possible values of $m$, we need to use the discriminant of the quadratic equation $2x^2+mx+8$: 

$D = b^2-4ac = m^2-4(2)(8) = m^2-64$ 

For the quadratic to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than zero: 

$D > 0$ 
$m^2-64 > 0$ 
$m < -8$ or $m > 8$ 

Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $(-\infty,-8) \cup (8,\infty)$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
Hmm, that does seem like a difficult question. But I'll give it a try. 

To maximize revenue, we need to find the price that will result in the highest product of price and quantity sold. In other words, we want to find the maximum of the function $R(p) = p(128-4p)$. 

To do this, we can use calculus. We take the derivative of $R(p)$: 

$$R'(p) = 128 - 8p$$

We set this equal to zero to find the critical point: 

$$128 - 8p = 0$$
$$p = 16$$

We also check the endpoints of the given interval: 

- When $p=0$, $128-4p=128$, so the revenue is 0.
- When $p=32$, $128-4p=0$, so the revenue is also 0.

So the only critical point we found, $p=16$, must be a maximum. Therefore, the store should charge $\boxed{\$16}$ for the book to maximize revenue.

$$(1+\frac16)w=1\cdot w + \frac16 w = \frac{7}{6}w = \frac{1}{14} \cdot 7 = \frac{1}{2}$$

Um, I'm not exactly sure how to solve the problem, but I'll give it a shot.

We can start by substituting $f(x)$ for $y$ so that we have $f(y) = x$ and $f(x) = y$.  Then we want to find $f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = y - f^{-1}(y)$.  Let's call this expression $E$.

Since $f(f(x))=x$, we can substitute $y$ for $f(x)$ to get $f(y) = x$.  Then we have $f^{-1}(x) = y$.

Substituting this into our expression $E$ gives $E = y - f^{-1}(y) = f(y) - y$.  But we know that $f(y) = x$, so $E = x - y$.

Now we just need to substitute $f(x)$ for $y$ to get $E = x - f(x)$.  I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct answer, but that's my guess.

This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.

Hmm, this is a tough one, but I'll give it a shot. 

Let's start by simplifying the expression inside the logarithm. We have $\sqrt{2}=2^{1/2}$, so we can rewrite $\log_28\sqrt{2}$ as $\log_28\cdot 2^{1/2}$.

Now we can use the property of logarithms that says $\log_ab^c=c\log_ab$ to rewrite this as $\frac{1}{2} \log_28\cdot 2$. 

We know that $\log_28=3$ because $2^3=8$, so we have $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot \log_22$, which simplifies to $\frac{3}{2}$.

Therefore, $\log_28\sqrt{2} = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}$.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Hmm, this sounds like a complicated problem, but I'll give it a try. Let's call the number of tickets bought above 60 $x$ and the initial price of each ticket $p$. 

So if we buy up to 60 tickets, the total cost is $60p$. If we buy more than 60 tickets, each ticket costs $p-x$. So the total cost becomes $60p + (t-60)(p-x)$. 

Now we need to find the value of $t$ that will make the amusement park a profit greater than $\$4200$. The profit is simply the revenue (total cost) minus the initial cost of the tickets, which is $70t$. 

So profit $= (60p + (t-60)(p-x)) - 70t$

$= 60p + tp - 60p - tx + 3600 - 4200$

$= tp - tx - 600$

$= (p-x)t - 600$

We want this value to be greater than $\$4200$, so:

$(p-x)t - 600 > 4200$

$(70-x)t > 4800$

$t > \frac{4800}{70-x}$

We want the largest integer value of $t$ that satisfies this inequality, so we need to find the largest integer value of $t$ such that:

$t \geq \frac{4800}{70-x}$

$t = \left\lfloor \frac{4800}{70-x} \right\rfloor$

Calculating this for $x = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, we find that the largest integer value of $t$ is $\boxed{90}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The function $k(y) = \frac{1}{2y+1}$ is defined as long as the denominator $2y+1$ is not equal to zero, that is, $2y+1\neq 0$. Solving for $y$ gives $y\neq -\frac12$. Therefore, the domain of $k$ is all real numbers except $-\frac12$, which can be written as $$\boxed{(-\infty,-\tfrac{1}{2})\cup(-\tfrac{1}{2},\infty)}. $$

Extracting Answer from: 
First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are no real solutions to $x(x+5)=-n$ if and only if $x(x+5)$ is positive and greater than $-n$.  Thus we are asking: for each value of $n$ between $1$ and $10$, what is the probability that $x(x+5)$ is positive and greater than $-n$?  The quadratic $x(x+5)$ is zero at $x=-5$ and $x=0$, so it is negative between these two roots and positive outside them.  Thus we need $x$ to be less than $-5$ or greater than $0$.  This can occur for $7$ out of the $10$ possible values of $n$ (namely, $n=1,2,3,4,6,8,10$). Therefore, the probability is $\boxed{\frac{7}{10}}$.

I'm not very confident in answering math questions, but I will give this a try. Let's first find the values of $x$ such that $f(x)=3$. We know that $f(4)=3$, so $f^{-1}(3)=4$. Therefore, we want to find $f^{-1}(4)$. 

Since $f(1)=2$, $f(4)=3$, and $f(7)=4$, we can see that $f(x)$ is increasing. Therefore, we know that $f^{-1}(x)$ is also increasing. We can use the fact that $f(4)=3$ to find that $f^{-1}(3)=4$. Similarly, we can use the fact that $f(1)=2$ to find that $f^{-1}(2)=1$ and the fact that $f(7)=4$ to find that $f^{-1}(4)=7$. 

Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3))=f^{-1}(4)=\boxed{7}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
I think I can answer this question! To find the minimum value of the quadratic $x^2- 14x + 3$, we need to find its vertex. We can do this by finding the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, which is: 

$$x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-(-14)}{2(1)} = 7$$

So, the value of $x$ that will give the minimum value for the quadratic is $x=7$. 

To find the minimum value, we can substitute $x=7$ into the quadratic:

$$7^2- 14(7) + 3 = -86$$

Therefore, the minimum value of the quadratic is $-86$.
