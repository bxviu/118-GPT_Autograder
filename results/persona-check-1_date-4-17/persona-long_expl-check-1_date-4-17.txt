Extracting Answer from: 
To find the vertical asymptotes of the given function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to see where the denominator of the function is equal to zero since division by zero is undefined.

The denominator of the function is $x^2+x-6$, and we can factor it as $(x+3)(x-2)$. Therefore, the function is undefined (has a vertical asymptote) at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

To confirm that these are vertical asymptotes, we can check the behavior of the function as $x$ approaches these values. As $x$ approaches $-3$ or $2$, the denominator becomes very close to zero, and the absolute value of the denominator becomes larger and larger. Therefore, the quotient $\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ becomes very large in absolute value as $x$ approaches these vertical asymptotes, either positive infinity or negative infinity, depending on the sign of the numerator.

Therefore, the graph of the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has two vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_long_explanation_answers/1001_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation using the definition of the ceiling function. Recall that $\lceil x \rceil$ is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to $x$. 

Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer, we can rewrite the given equation as:

$$\lceil x \rceil + x = n + x = \frac{23}{7}$$ 

Where $n$ is some integer. Solving for $x$:

$$x = \frac{23}{7} - n$$

We know that $n \leq x < n+1$ by definition of the ceiling function. Substituting $x$ with our equation above:

$$n \leq \frac{23}{7} - n < n+1$$

Simplifying and solving for $n$:

\begin{align*}
n &\leq \frac{23}{14} < n+1 \\
-\frac{1}{2} &\leq \frac{23}{14} - n < \frac{1}{2} \\
-\frac{1}{2} + n &\leq \frac{23}{14} < \frac{1}{2} + n \\
\end{align*}

Since $n$ is an integer, we can see that $\frac{23}{14}$ must be between two consecutive integers. Checking the multiples of $14$ closest to $23$: 

$$14 \cdot 1 = 14 < 23 < 14\cdot 2 = 28$$

So, $n = 1$ and 

$$x = \frac{23}{7} - 1 = \boxed{\frac{9}{7}}$$

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by simplifying each of the three terms in the expression. Since $i^2=-1$, we can replace any $i^4$ that appears with 1. Therefore, $i^5=i\cdot i^4=i\cdot 1=i$. Similarly, $i^{-25}= 1/i^{25}=1/(i^{24}\cdot i)=1/1\cdot i=-i$, and $i^{45} = i^{44}\cdot i^1=1\cdot i=i$. Substituting back into the original expression, we get $i+(-i)+i= \boxed{i}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Of course! So, we know that $2^8$ and $4^x$ are equal. Recall that $4$ is equal to $2^2$, so we can rewrite $4^x$ as $(2^2)^x$. By the properties of exponents, we can simplify this to $2^{2x}$.

So now we have the equation $2^8 = 2^{2x}$. We know that these two exponential expressions are equal, so their exponents must be equal as well. That means we can set $8 = 2x$ and solve for $x$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, it's important to understand that an arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers where each term differs from the previous one by a constant amount called the common difference. In this case, the common difference is 4, since each term is 4 more than the previous one.

To find the 100th term of the sequence, we need to use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is:

a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of the term we want to find.

In this case, we know that a_1 is 6 and d is 4. We want to find the 100th term, so we plug these values into the formula:

a_100 = 6 + (100-1)*4

Simplifying this expression, we get:

a_100 = 6 + 99*4

a_100 = 6 + 396

a_100 = 402

Therefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ... is 402.

Extracting Answer from: 
Certainly! To solve this inequality, we want to get $x$ by itself on one side of the inequality. We can start by adding $4$ to both sides, giving us $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. Next, we can factor the left-hand side by finding two numbers that multiply to give $-14$ and add to give $-5$. Those two numbers are $-7$ and $2$, so we can write the inequality as $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. 

Now, we want to find when the product $(x - 7)(x + 2)$ is less than or equal to zero. To do this, we can use a sign chart. We note that $(x - 7)$ is negative when $x < 7$ and positive when $x > 7$, while $(x + 2)$ is negative when $x < -2$ and positive when $x > -2$. 

We can make a table with $x$ values in three regions:
\begin{align*}
\text{Region 1:} && x &< -2\\
\text{Region 2:} && -2 &\le x \le 7\\
\text{Region 3:} && x &> 7
\end{align*}

In each region, we can determine the sign of $(x - 7)$ and $(x + 2)$, and use that to find the sign of $(x - 7)(x + 2)$. The sign chart looks like this:

\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}
$x$        & $-$ & & $-2$ & & $7$  \\ 
\hline
$(x - 7)$  & $-$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ \\ 
$(x + 2)$  & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ & $+$ \\ 
$(x - 7)(x + 2)$ & $+$ & $-$ & $-$ & $+$ & $+$ \\
\end{tabular}

We see that $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$ when $-2 \le x \le 7$, so our answer is the interval $\boxed{[-2,7]}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Ah, thank you for asking! This is a classic problem in finance and can be solved using the formula for compound interest. Let me break it down for you.

Firstly, we need to understand what compound interest is. Compound interest is the interest that is earned on both the principal (the initial amount invested) and any previously earned interest. This means that as time goes on, the interest earned will increase at a faster rate.

Now, onto the problem. We are given that Mr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate. After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars. We need to find the annual interest rate, as a percentage.

Let's use the formula for compound interest to solve this problem:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n*t)

where:

A = the final amount (in this case, 1225 dollars)
P = the principal (the initial amount invested - 1000 dollars)
r = the annual interest rate (what we are solving for)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year (in this case, once annually)
t = the time period (in this case, 3 years)

Substituting the values we know into the formula, we get:

1225 = 1000(1 + r/1)^(1*3)

Simplifying:

1 + r = (1225/1000)^(1/3)

1 + r = 1.075

r = 0.075 or 7.5%

Therefore, the annual interest rate is 7.5%, rounded to the nearest integer.

I hope that explanation was helpful!

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}

\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first start by looking at the sum of all four integers, which is $$10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29 = 117.$$ Since each integer is distinct, their sum must be the sum of four consecutive integers. Therefore, we can write: $$a + b + c + d = 117/4 = 29.25.$$ Since $a,b,c,d$ are integers, two of these numbers must sum to 14 and the other two must sum to 15. 

We can now look at the possible pairs of sums that add up to 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29. Since the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are distinct, we know that $a+b$ cannot be any of the larger sums and $c+d$ cannot be any of the smaller sums. Therefore, the only possibility is that: $$a+b = 10$$ and $$c+d = 29.$$ 

Now, we know that the sum of the two middle numbers $b+c$ must be 19. This leaves us with the following system of equations: 

\begin{align*}
a + b &= 10 \\
b + c &= 19 \\
c + d &= 29 \\
a + d &= 20 \\
a + c &= 21 \\
b + d &= 18
\end{align*}

From the first and second equation, we know that $a + b + b + c = 29$, so $a+c=10$. From the second and third equation, we know that $b+c+c+d=48$, so $b+d=10$. Therefore, we have: $$a=1, b=9, c=10, d=19.$$ 

Therefore, the four integers in increasing order are: $\boxed{1, 9, 10, 19}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $|5x - 1|$ is always nonnegative, so $|3x + 2| \ge 0$, which tells us that $x \ge -\frac{2}{3}$.  Both $|5x - 1|$ and $|3x + 2|$ are nonnegative, so for them to be equal we must either have $5x-1=3x+2$ or $5x-1=-(3x+2)$.  Solving the first equation gives $x=\frac{3}{2}$, while solving the second equation gives $x=-\frac{1}{4}$.  We check that both of these values work: when $x = \frac{3}{2}$, we have $|5x - 1| = |7| = 7$ and $|3x + 2| = |\frac{11}{2}| = \frac{11}{2}$, so the equation is not satisfied.  When $x = -\frac{1}{4}$, we have $|5x-1|=|\frac{3}{4}|=\frac{3}{4}$ and  $|3x+2|=|\frac{1}{4}|=\frac{1}{4}$, so this value does satisfy the equation.  Thus, the smallest value of $x$ that works is $\boxed{-\frac{1}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First we need to find the formula for $h(x)$.  We have $h(x)=f(g(x))$, so we substitute the definition of $f$ and $g$ to get: \begin{align*}
h(x) &= f(g(x))\\
&=(7g(x)+5)\\
&=(7(x-1)+5)\\
&=7x-2.
\end{align*} The inverse of $h(x)$ is the function $h^{-1}(x)$ that undoes the effects of $h(x)$. The standard method to find an inverse function is to switch the roles of $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$.  So let $y=h(x)=7x-2$, and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
y&=7x-2\\
7x&=y+2\\
x&=\frac{1}{7}y+\frac{2}{7}.
\end{align*} Thus the formula for the inverse of $h(x)$ is $h^{-1}(x)=\frac{1}{7}x+\frac{2}{7}$.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first simplify the inequalities. The inequality $|x|+1>7$ becomes $|x|>6$ when we subtract 1 from each side. The inequality $|x+1|\le7$ becomes $-7\le x+1\le7$. Adding 1 to each part of the inequality results in $-6\le x\le6$. 

So our solution must satisfy both $|x|>6$ and $-6\le x\le6$. Let's consider the values of $x$ separately:

If $x>6$, then $|x|=x$. But $|x|>6$ means $x>6$, which contradicts $-6\le x\le6$, so there are no solutions in this case. 

If $-6\le x\le-1$, then $|x|=-x$. Then $-x>6$ is equivalent to $x<-6$, which again contradicts $-6\le x\le6$. So there are no solutions in this case either.

If $x=0$, then $|x|=0$ and $|x+1|=1\le7$, so $x=0$ is a solution.

If $1\le x\le 6$, then $|x|=x$ and $|x+1|=x+1\le7$, so $x+1\le7$ or $x\le6$. Thus, there are 6 integers in this case that satisfy the inequalities: $x=1,2,3,4,5,6$.

If we add up all the possible values of $x$, we get $0+1+2+3+4+5+6=\boxed{21}$.

Certainly! The distance between any two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ in a Cartesian coordinate system can be calculated by using the distance formula $$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}.$$ Here, the two points we are interested in are the origin $(0,0)$ and the point $(-8,6)$. Substituting $x_1=0$, $y_1=0$, $x_2=-8$, and $y_2=6$ in the distance formula gives $$d = \sqrt{(-8 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10.$$ Therefore, the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is $\boxed{10}$.

To find the midpoint of a line segment, we average the $x$-coordinates and the $y$-coordinates of the endpoints. The $x$-coordinates of the endpoints are both 1, so the $x$-coordinate of the midpoint is $\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$. The $y$-coordinates of the endpoints are 4 and 10, so the $y$-coordinate of the midpoint is $\frac{4+10}{2} = 7$. Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is $1+7 = \boxed{8}$.

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $g(x)$ contains a difference of squares inside the square root. So we simplify:

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2} &= \sqrt{(x-3+x-8)(x-3-x+8)}\\
&=\sqrt{-2(x-5)(x-11)}.
\end{align*}

In order for the expression under the square root to be nonnegative (which is required for a real-valued function with a real domain), we must have $$-2(x-5)(x-11)\geq0.$$ The critical points occur where the quadratic $-2(x-5)(x-11)$ changes sign. These occur at $x=5$ and $x=11$. So we test these intervals separated by the two critical values:

\[
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
& x<5 & 5<x\leq11 & x>11 \\ \hline
-2(x-5)(x-11) & - & + & - \\
\sqrt{-2(x-5)(x-11)} & \text{DNE} & \text{real} & \text{DNE} \\
\end{array}
\]

From the chart, we see that the only place where the expression under the square root is defined is $5<x\leq 11$, so this is the domain of $g(x)$.  Thus, the smallest real number in the domain is $\boxed{5}$.

Let's start by simplifying the given expression: $$\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}.$$We notice that the denominator on the right-hand side can be simplified further: $$\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{9\cdot\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3}} = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$Therefore, we have: $$\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}.$$Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2C}{\sqrt{B}}$, we obtain: $$\frac{2CA}{\sqrt{B}} = 3C\sqrt{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad A\sqrt{B} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}BC}{2}.$$Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we can conclude that $B$ must be of the form $B = 3^2 \cdot k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Dividing both sides of the previous equation by $\sqrt{B}$, we get: $$A\sqrt{3} = \frac{9Ck}{2}.$$Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, we can conclude that both $A$ and $C$ must divide $9k$. Moreover, since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $A$ must be a multiple of 3 (otherwise, the left-hand side of the equation would be rational while the right-hand side would be irrational). Therefore, we can write $A = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting into the previous equation, we obtain: $$3m\sqrt{3} = \frac{9Ck}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad m\sqrt{3} = \frac{3Ck}{2}.$$Since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $m$ must be divisible by 3 (otherwise, we would again have a rational expression on the left-hand side and an irrational expression on the right-hand side). Therefore, we can write $m = 3n$ for some positive integer $n$. Substituting once more, we get: $$3n\sqrt{3} = \frac{3Ck}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad n\sqrt{3} = \frac{Ck}{2}.$$Since $C$ and $k$ are positive integers, it follows that $C$ must be divisible by 2 (otherwise, the right-hand side would be irrational while the left-hand side would be rational). Therefore, we can write $C = 2p$ for some positive integer $p$. Substituting once more, we obtain: $$n\sqrt{3} = pk.$$Since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $k$ must be divisible by 3 (otherwise, the left-hand side would be irrational while the right-hand side would be rational). Therefore, we can write $k = 3q$ for some positive integer $q$. Substituting once more, we get: $$n\sqrt{3} = 3pq.$$Since $n$ and $p$ are positive integers and $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $n$ must be divisible by 3 (otherwise, the right-hand side would be irrational while the left-hand side would be rational). Therefore, we can write $n = 3r$ for some positive integer $r$. Substituting once more, we obtain: $$r\sqrt{3} = pq.$$Since $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, it follows that $r$ and $pq$ are positive integers as well. Therefore, $r$ is a positive integer, and we have expressed both $A$ and $C$ in terms of $r$ and $p$ as follows: $$A = 3m = 9n = 27r, \quad C = 2p.$$Finally, we can use the fact that $A+B+C = 27r + 3^2 \cdot k^2 + 2p = 27r + 9q^2 + 4p.$ We have expressed $A+B+C$ in terms of $r$, $p$ and $q$. However, we still need to determine the values of $p$ and $q$ that satisfy the given equation. Recall that we have derived the equation $r\sqrt{3} = pq$. Since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $r$ must be a multiple of 3, and $pq$ must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, we can write $r = 3s$ and $pq = 3t$ for some positive integers $s$ and $t$. Substituting once more, we get: $$s\sqrt{3} = t.$$Since $s$ and $t$ are positive integers, it follows that $s$ and $t$ must be equal. Therefore, we can write $s = t = u$ for some positive integer $u$. Substituting once more, we obtain: $$A+B+C = 27r + 9q^2 + 4p = 27\cdot 3u + 9\cdot 3^2\cdot u^2 + 4\cdot 2p = 81u^2 + 8p.$$Therefore, to find the value of $A+B+C$, we need to find the smallest possible values of $u$ and $p$ that satisfy the equation $s\sqrt{3} = t$. Since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational, it follows that $s$ and $t$ must have the same prime factors. Since $t$ is a multiple of 3, we can conclude that $s$ must be a multiple of 3 as well. Therefore, we can choose $s = 3$, which gives $t = 3\sqrt{3}$. Since $t$ is a multiple of 3, we can conclude that $p$ must be a multiple of 3 as well (otherwise, the right-hand side of the equation for $A+B+C$ would not be an integer). Therefore, we can choose $p = 3$. Substituting these values, we get: $$A+B+C = 81u^2 + 8p = 81\cdot 3^2 + 8\cdot 3 = \boxed{767}.$$

Let $t,s,g$ be the weight of one treek, the weight of one squig, and the weight of one goolee, respectively. Then the given information tells us \begin{align*}
10t &=3s+g\\
2t +g &= s.
\end{align*} Since we would like to solve for $s$ in terms of $t$, we want to eliminate $g$. Add the two equations to obtain \begin{align*}
10t+2t+g &= 3s+g+s\\
\Rightarrow 10t+2t &= 3s+s\\
\Rightarrow 4s &= 12t\\
\Rightarrow s &=3t.
\end{align*} So one squig weighs $\boxed{3}$ treeks.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, let's denote the weight of one treek as "t", the weight of one squig as "s", and the weight of one goolee as "g". 

According to the problem, we have the following relationships: 

- 10t = 3s + g   (ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee)
- 2t + g = s     (two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig)

To solve for the combined weight of how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, we need to eliminate either "g" or "t" from the equations above. 

Let's first eliminate "g" by isolating it in the first equation: 

- 10t = 3s + g 
- g = 10t - 3s 

Now we can substitute this expression for "g" into the second equation: 

- 2t + g = s 
- 2t + (10t - 3s) = s   (substituting for "g")
- 12t = 4s 
- 3t = s 

Therefore, the combined weight of three treeks equals the weight of one squig.

Extracting Answer from: 
Well, to answer this question, we need to use the given information that an 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water contains 125 calories. To find out how many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle, we can use proportional reasoning. That is, we can set up a ratio of calories to fluid ounces and use that ratio to find the missing quantity. 

First, let's write this ratio as a fraction: 

calories/fluid ounces

For the 8 fluid ounce bottle, we know that the number of calories is 125, so we can write: 

125/8 

Now, to find out how many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle, we can set up a proportion: 

125/8 = x/12 

where x is the number of calories in the 12 fluid ounce bottle. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

8x = 125 * 12 

and then solve for x: 

8x = 1500 

x = 187.5 

Therefore, a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water would contain approximately 187.5 calories.

Certainly, the sum and product of the roots of the polynomial are $m$ and $n$ respectively, so $m$ is the sum of two positive prime integers, which is even, and $n$ is the product of two positive prime integers. Therefore, one of the primes must be $2,$ since otherwise $n$ would be odd. But if the other prime is $2,$ then $m=4$ which is too large. Therefore, one of the primes must be $2$ and the other must be odd. The only possibilities, then, for $m$ are $3+2=5, 5+2=7, 7+2=9, 11+2=13, 13+2=15, 17+2=19.$ Out of these, the only ones that are the sum of exactly two odd primes (not necessarily distinct) are $3+2,$ $7+2,$ and $19+2=3+3+5,$ so the possible values of $n$ are $2\cdot 3=6,$ $2 \cdot 5=10,$ $2 \cdot 7=14,$ $3 \cdot 5=15,$ $3 \cdot 7 = 21,$ $5\cdot 7=35,$ and $3\cdot 3 \cdot 5=45,$ for $\boxed{7}$ possible values.

Certainly! 

We are given that Mike paid $\$1.25$ for a stamp three years ago. We are then told that he has been offered double that amount for the stamp, and that the offer price for the stamp doubles every three years. 

So, three years after Mike paid $\$1.25$, the offer price for the stamp was $\$2.50$ (double the original price). Then, after another three years (six years after Mike paid $\$1.25$), the offer price would be $\$5$ (double the $\$2.50$ price). 

Now, to answer the question: we need to determine the offer price for the stamp twelve years from when Mike paid $\$1.25$. We can do this by thinking about how many three-year periods have passed since Mike paid $\$1.25$. 

Since twelve years is four three-year periods, the offer price for the stamp will double four times (from $\$1.25$ to $\$2.50$, then to $\$5$, then to $\$10$, and finally to $\$20$). So Mike would be offered $\boxed{\$20}$ for the stamp in twelve more years.

Great question! So first, we're given that the pressure and volume of this sample of gas are inversely proportional at constant temperature. That means we can use the equation P₁V₁ = P₂V₂, where P₁ is the initial pressure, V₁ is the initial volume, P₂ is the new pressure, and V₂ is the new volume.

Now let's plug in the values we were given. We know that the initial volume is 3.67 liters and the initial pressure is 4 kPa, so we can write:

P₁V₁ = P₂V₂
(4 kPa)(3.67 L) = P₂(1.835 L)

To solve for P₂, we'll divide both sides by 1.835 L:

(4 kPa)(3.67 L) / (1.835 L) = P₂
8 kPa = P₂

So the new pressure will be 8 kPa.

Now, the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x^2}$ takes any real number input $x$ and returns the non-negative square root of $x^2$.

Certainly! We can begin by expanding the product of the two binomials on the left-hand side of the equation:

$$(2x+5)(x-3) = 2x(x-3) + 5(x-3) = 2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15 = 2x^2 - x - 15.$$ 

Now we have the equation $2x^2 - x - 15 = 14$. Let's move the constant term to the right-hand side:

$$2x^2 - x - 29 = 0.$$ 

We can solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula: 

$$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$ 

Plugging in $a=2$, $b=-1$, and $c=-29$ gives us:

$$x = \frac{-(-1)\pm\sqrt{(-1)^2-4(2)(-29)}}{2(2)} = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{1+8\cdot 29}}{4}.$$ 

Simplifying, we have 

$$x = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{233}}{4}.$$ 

Thus, the possible values of $x$ are $\frac{1+\sqrt{233}}{4}$ and $\frac{1-\sqrt{233}}{4}$, and their sum is: 

$$ \frac{1+\sqrt{233}}{4} + \frac{1-\sqrt{233}}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$$

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

To begin, note that the roots of the quadratic are $\frac{7\pm\sqrt{49-4c}}{2}$. For the roots to be real and rational, we must have $49-4c$ as an integer square, say $k^2$. Solving for $c$, we get $c = \frac{49-k^2}{4}$.

Since $c$ is a positive integer, $k$ must be odd, and hence $k^2\equiv1\pmod{8}$. Thus, we have $\frac{49-k^2}{4}\equiv\frac{4}{4}\pmod{8}\equiv1\pmod{8}$, so $c$ must be congruent to $1\pmod{8}$.

Conversely, if $c$ is congruent to $1\pmod{8}$, then $k=\sqrt{49-4c}$ is odd, and hence the quadratic has two rational, real roots.

Therefore, the answer is all positive integers $c\equiv1\pmod{8}$, expressed in decreasing order: $$c=\boxed{41,33,25,17,9,1}.$$

Great question! Let's begin by using the quadratic formula to find the values of $a$ and $b$. The quadratic formula tells us that the solutions to the equation $ax^{2} + bx + c= 0$ are given by the formula:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}.$$

In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=-5$, and $c=9$, so the solutions are:

$$\begin{aligned} x&=\frac{-(-5)\pm\sqrt{(-5)^{2}-4(1)(9)}}{2(1)} \\ &=\frac{5\pm\sqrt{1}}{2}\\ &=\frac{5\pm1}{2}. \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $a=\frac{5+1}{2}=3$ and $b=\frac{5-1}{2}=2$. Now we can compute $(a-1)(b-1)$:

$$(a-1)(b-1)=(3-1)(2-1)=2(1)=\boxed{2}.$$ 

And that's our final answer!

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

We begin by letting $x_1$ and $x_2$ be the roots of the quadratic, such that $x_1/x_2=3/1$. We may write $x_1=3x_2$.

By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is $-b$, so $$x_1+x_2=-b.$$Substituting $x_1=3x_2$, we have $$x_2+3x_2=-b$$and therefore $x_2=-b/4$.

Also by Vieta's formulas, we know that the product of the roots is $48$, so $$x_1x_2=48.$$Substituting $x_1=3x_2$, we have $$3x_2^2=48$$and therefore $x_2=\pm 4\sqrt{3}/3$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ must have opposite signs, we take $x_2=-4\sqrt{3}/3$.

Finally, we can solve for $b$: $$-b=x_1+x_2=3x_2+x_2=4x_2=-16\sqrt{3}/3,$$so $b=\boxed{\frac{16\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let feathers cost f dollars per pound and gold cost g dollars per ounce. Then we can set up two equations using the given information:

$$8f + 2g = 932$$

$$14f + 3g = 1402$$

To solve for f and g, we can multiply the first equation by 7 and subtract it from the second equation multiplied by 4:

$$(98f + 21g) - (56f + 14g) = 3920 - 6512$$

$$42f + 7g = 2592$$

Now we can solve for f or g by using either of the first two equations. Let's use the first equation and solve for f:

$$f = \frac{932 - 2g}{8}$$

Substituting this into the equation we just obtained, we have:

$$42\left(\frac{932 - 2g}{8}\right) + 7g = 2592$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$g = 86$$

Using this value of g, we can solve for f using either of the first two equations. Let's use the second equation:

$$14f + 3(86) = 1402$$

$$14f = 1198$$

$$f = 85.57$$

Therefore, five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold would cost:

$$(5)(85.57) + (5)(86) = 857.85 + 430 = 1287.85$$

Thus, the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is $\$1287.85$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the radius of a circle given its equation, we need to first complete the square for both $x$ and $y$. 

For $x$, we add $(8/2)^2 = 16$ to both sides of the equation to get: 
\begin{align*}
x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y &= 0 \\
\Rightarrow x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 - 6y &= 16 \\
\Rightarrow (x+4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= 4^2
\end{align*}

We have arrived at the standard form equation of a circle: $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, where $(a,b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is its radius. Hence, the center of the circle is $(-4,3)$ and the radius is $\boxed{4}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the sum of each of the 15 two-element subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. 

One way to approach this is to list out all the possible two-element subsets and find their sums. Alternatively, we can use a shortcut. 

Note that there are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ two-element subsets of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Let's call one of these subsets $\{a,b\}$, where $a$ and $b$ are distinct elements of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. The sum of this subset is simply $a+b$. 

However, there are 15 different two-element subsets, each with their own unique pair of $a$ and $b$. So to find the sum of all 15 sums, we need to add up all the possible values of $a+b$ for $a$ and $b$ distinct elements of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. 

We can do this by first finding the sum of all pairs of distinct elements of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, and then dividing by 2 to avoid overcounting. 

One way to find the sum of all pairs of distinct elements is to first find the sum of all possible pairs of elements (including duplicates), which is simply the sum of all the elements squared: 

$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 91$

Then we subtract off the sum of all pairs of identical elements, which is simply the sum of all the elements: 

$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$

So the sum of all pairs of distinct elements is: 

$91 - 21 = 70$

Dividing by 2 gives us the sum of all possible values of $a+b$: 

$\frac{70}{2} = 35$

Therefore, the sum of all 15 sums is: 

$15 \cdot 35 = \boxed{525}$

To find $q$, we can use the first equation we obtained and plug in $p=-1$ and the point $(13,q)$: $$\frac{-14-q}{-1-2} = \frac{-9}{-1-2} \implies q=-23.$$Finally, we have $p+q=-1-23=\boxed{24}$ to the nearest tenth.

Extracting Answer from: 
The first term of the sequence is $\frac{125}{9}$ and the common ratio between terms is $\frac{25/3}{125/9}=\frac{3}{5}$.  Therefore, the $n$th term of the sequence is $\left(\frac{125}{9}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^{n-1}$.

Setting $n=8$, we have the eighth term is $\left(\frac{125}{9}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7$.  To simplify this expression, we note that $125=5^3$ and $9=3^2$. Thus, we can write $\left(\frac{125}{9}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7=\frac{5^3}{3^2}\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^7$.  Using the properties of exponents, we can simplify this expression as $\frac{5^3}{3^2}\left(\frac{3^7}{5^7}\right)=\frac{5^3 \cdot 3^7}{3^2 \cdot 5^7}=\frac{5^{3-7} \cdot 3^{7-2}}{1}=\boxed{\frac{27}{625}}$. 

Alternatively, we could have found the first several terms of the sequence and looked for a pattern.  For example, the first five terms are $\frac{125}{9}, \frac{25}{3}, 5, 3, \frac 95$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can begin by simplifying the right side of the equation, since $27=3^3$:

\begin{align*}
9^{18n} &= (3^2)^{18n} \\ 
&= 3^{4\cdot9n} \\ 
&= 3^{36n}.
\end{align*}

So the equation we need to solve is $3^{36n}=27^{24}=(3^3)^{24}=3^{72}$. We can solve for $n$ by equating the exponents:

\begin{align*}
36n &= 72 \\
n &= \boxed{2}.

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

First, we can simplify the inequality by subtracting 4 from all three parts to obtain \[-8<(x^{2}+2)^{2}<17.\] Taking the square root of all parts, we get \[\sqrt{-8}<x^{2}+2<\sqrt{17}.\] Since $\sqrt{-8}$ is not real, the left inequality is never satisfied, so we only need to consider the right inequality. First we subtract 2 from all parts and take the square root to get $-\sqrt{15}<x<\sqrt{15}$. Since $x^{2}$ is always non-negative, we know that $\sqrt{15}>0$, so the solution is \[x\in\boxed{(-\sqrt{15},\sqrt{15})}.\]

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Let's start by simplifying each of the terms by rationalizing the denominator: \begin{align*}
\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &= \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} + 1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \\
\sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} &= \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\end{align*}So, we have \[\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}+\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}.\]To put this in the desired form, we combine the terms using a common denominator: \begin{align*}
\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}+\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} &= \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{6}+\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{6} \\
&= \frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

We can rewrite $x^2+y^2=14x+48y$ as $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square in $x$ and $y$, we get $(x-7)^2-49+(y-24)^2-576=0$, which simplifies to $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This is the equation of a circle with center $(7,24)$ and radius $25$. The maximum value of $y$ occurs when a point on this circle has the largest $y$-coordinate, which is when it is on the vertical line passing through the center of the circle. Therefore, the maximum value of $y$ is $24+25=\boxed{49}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Consider the quadratic formula $x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, which gives the roots of a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$.  The discriminant $b^2-4ac$ determines whether the roots are real, and whether they are distinct.  Specifically, if $b^2-4ac>0$, then the quadratic has two real roots; if $b^2-4ac=0$, then the quadratic has one real root (called a double root); and if $b^2-4ac<0$, then the quadratic has two complex roots (conjugates of each other).  (This is the reason why the quadratic formula is also sometimes called the "discriminant formula").

So, if $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots, we must have $m^2-4\cdot 2\cdot 8>0$.  Simplifying this gives $m^2-64>0$, or $(m-8)(m+8)>0$.  The sign diagram for this inequality is:

Well, first we should note that the absolute value of $x-1$ means that whatever is inside the absolute value bars will be positive, or zero. So we can split this equation into two cases: $x-1 = 7$ and $x-1 = -7$. If we add $1$ to both sides of each equation, we get $x = 8$ and $x = -6$. The sum of these solutions is $8 + (-6) = \boxed{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the price that maximizes revenue, we first need to compute the revenue function. Revenue is simply the price of the book multiplied by the number of books sold. In this case, if the price is $p$ dollars, then the number of books sold per month is $128-4p$, so the revenue function is:

$$R(p) = p(128-4p) = 128p-4p^2$$

Now we need to find the value of $p$ that maximizes this function. To do this, we can take the derivative of $R(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it equal to zero, since the maximum or minimum of a function occurs at a critical point where the derivative is zero:

$$\frac{dR}{dp} = 128 - 8p = 0$$

Solving this equation for $p$, we get:

$$p = 16$$

So the price that maximizes revenue is $16$ dollars. To verify that this is a maximum, we can check the second derivative:

$$\frac{d^2R}{dp^2} = -8 < 0$$

Since the second derivative is negative at $p=16$, this confirms that $p=16$ is a maximum. Therefore, the store should charge $16$ dollars for the book to maximize its revenue.

To solve for $w$, we want to isolate $w$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by $w$: 

$$\frac{1\frac16}{w}=\frac{42}{3}$$

$$\frac{7}{6w}=14$$

Now we can solve for $w$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{6}{7}$: 

$$\frac{7}{6w}\cdot \frac{6}{7}=14\cdot \frac{6}{7}$$

$$\frac{1}{w}=\frac{84}{7}$$

$$w=\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$$

Therefore, $\frac{1\frac16}{w}=\frac{42}{3}$ is equivalent to $w=\frac{1}{12}$.

Simplifying, we have $10 + 10i - 10i - 10i^2$. 

Since $i^2 = -1$, we can substitute $-1$ for every instance of $i^2$, giving us $10 + 10i - 10i - 10(-1) = 10+10i+10 = \boxed{20+10i}.$

We are given two functions, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of which are defined on the interval $0\le x\le18$. The question asks us to find the maximum value of the difference $f(x)-g(x)$ on this interval.

A good place to start is by finding the points where the graphs of $f$ and $g$ intersect. From the graph, we see that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ intersect at $x=2$, $x=10$, and $x=18$. At each of these points, we can find the value of $f(x)-g(x)$:

\begin{align*}
\text{At }x=2:&\qquad f(2)-g(2) = (2-0)-(10-10) = -6 \\
\text{At }x=10:&\qquad f(10)-g(10) = (8-8)-(4-0) = 4 \\
\text{At }x=18:&\qquad f(18)-g(18) = (10-10)-(12-4) = 2.
\end{align*}

Thus, the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ occurs at $x=2$, where $f(x)-g(x)=-6$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{-6}$.

The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \cdot 77 = \boxed{12}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start the problem by using the formula for the $n$th term of an arithmetic sequence: $$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,$$ where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.

In this case, we have $a_1 = 1000$ and $d = -13$ (since we are subtracting 13 from each term to get to the next term). We want to find the least positive integer in the sequence, which means we want the first term that is greater than 0.

Setting $a_n$ greater than 0, we get: \begin{align*}
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d &> 0 \\
1000 + (n-1)(-13) &> 0 \\
1000 - 13n + 13 &> 0 \\
1013 - 13n &> 0 \\
13n &< 1013 \\
n &< \frac{1013}{13},
\end{align*} where we solved for $n$ by adding 13 to both sides of the inequality and dividing by -13 (which flips the direction of the inequality).

Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we know that the smallest possible value of $n$ that satisfies the inequality is 78, and the corresponding term $a_{78}$ is: $$a_{78} = 1000 + (78-1)(-13) = 17.$$ Therefore, the least positive integer in the sequence is $\boxed{17}$.

I'd be happy to! 

First off, we can simplify the expression $\sqrt{2}$ as $2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. Then, using the property $\log_ab^n = n\log_ab$, we can rewrite the expression as $\log_28\cdot2^{\frac{1}{2}}$. 

Now, we can use another property of logarithms, namely $\log_ab = \frac{\log_cb}{\log_ca}$, to change the base of our logarithm to a more convenient one -- let's choose base 2, since $8 = 2^3$: 

$$
\begin{aligned} \log_28\cdot2^{\frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{\log_2 2^3}{\log_2 8} \cdot 2^\frac{1}{2} \\ &= \frac{3}{\log_2 8} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}}. \end{aligned}
$$

But wait, we can simplify this further! $\log_2 8 = 3$, so we get:

$$
\begin{aligned} \frac{3}{\log_2 8} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{3}{3} \cdot 2^{\frac{1}{2}} \\ &= \boxed{2^{\frac{1}{2}}}. \end{aligned}
$$

That's our final answer!

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first consider the revenue the amusement park generates from selling $t$ tickets. If $t \leq 60$, then the price per ticket is $\$70$ and the revenue is $R = 70t$. If $t > 60$, then the first 60 tickets cost $\$70$ each, and the remaining $(t-60)$ tickets cost $(\$70 - \$1(t-60)) = (130-t)$ dollars each. The revenue is then:

$$
R = 70 \cdot 60 + (130 - t)(t - 60)
$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

\begin{align*}
R &= 70 \cdot 60 + (130t - t^2 - 780)\\
&= -t^2 + 130t - 4080
\end{align*}

Now we want to find the largest value of $t$ such that $R > 4200$. Substituting the expression we derived for $R$, we get:

$$
-t^2 + 130t - 4080 > 4200
$$

Rearranging and simplifying:

$$
t^2 - 130t + 8280 < 0
$$

Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:

$$
(t - 30)(t - 100) < 0
$$

Since we want $t$ to be as large as possible, we choose $t = \boxed{100}$ tickets as the largest bulk quantity that brings in a revenue greater than $\$4200$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Okay, let's break this down. We are supposed to evaluate the expression $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})$. 

First, let's simplify the expression inside the logarithm. 

We have $64\sqrt{8}$. We can simplify $64$ as $8^2$, and $\sqrt{8}$ as $2\sqrt{2}$. So we have:

$$64\sqrt{8} = 8^2\cdot2\sqrt{2}= 8\cdot8\cdot2\sqrt{2} = 64\sqrt{2}.$$

So now our expression becomes $\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{2})$. 

We can use the property of logarithms that states $\log_ab = \frac{\log_cb}{\log_ca}$, where $c$ is any positive real number (as long as it's not 1, which would cause a divide-by-zero error). 

So we can rewrite our expression as:

$$\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{2}) = \frac{\log_{10}(64\sqrt{2})}{\log_{10}(\sqrt8)}.$$

Now we just need to evaluate the two logarithms in the numerator and denominator. 

We can simplify $\sqrt{8}$ as $2\sqrt{2}$, so our denominator becomes $\log_{10}(2\sqrt{2})$. 

For the numerator, we can use the fact that $\log_ab = \log_ac\cdot\log_cb$, so we can write:

\begin{align*}
\log_{10}(64\sqrt{2}) &= \log_{10}(2^6\cdot\sqrt{2}) \\
&= \log_{10}(2^6) + \log_{10}(\sqrt{2}) \\
&= 6\log_{10}(2) + \frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(2).
\end{align*}

Now we just need to substitute these values back into our original expression:

\begin{align*}
\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{2}) &= \frac{\log_{10}(64\sqrt{2})}{\log_{10}(2\sqrt{2})} \\
&= \frac{6\log_{10}(2) + \frac{1}{2}\log_{10}(2)}{\log_{10}(2) + \log_{10}(\sqrt{2})} \\
&= \frac{12\log_{10}(2) + \log_{10}(2)}{2\log_{10}(2) + \log_{10}(2)} \\
&= \frac{13\log_{10}(2)}{3\log_{10}(2)} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{13}{3}}.
\end{align*}

In other words, we need to identify any values of $y$ that would cause the denominator of the fraction, $2y+1$, to equal zero, since division by zero is undefined. 

So, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for $y$: $$2y+1=0 \quad\Rightarrow \quad y=-\frac{1}{2}.$$ Therefore, the only value of $y$ that would make the function undefined is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Okay, let me break this down for you. We are given a function $f(x)$, and we know that $f(1)=2$, $f(4)=3$, and $f(7)=4$. The notation $f^{-1}(x)$ refers to the inverse of the function $f(x)$. In other words, if we have some input value $y$, and we apply $f^{-1}(y)$ to it, we get the input value that would have been used to produce $y$ if we had used $f(x)$.

Now, we are asked to find $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3))$. This means we need to start with the output value $3$ and apply $f^{-1}(x)$ twice. The first application of $f^{-1}(x)$ will give us the input value that would have produced $3$ if we had used $f(x)$, and the second application of $f^{-1}(x)$ will give us the input value that would have produced the outcome of the first application of $f^{-1}(x)$.

So, let's begin. We want to find the input value that produces $3$ when we apply $f(x)$. We know that $f(4)=3$, so $f^{-1}(3)=4$. Now we need to find the input value that would have produced $4$ if we had used $f(x)$. We know that $f(4)=3$, so $f^{-1}(4)=4$.

Putting this all together, we have $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3))=4$.

We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3&= x^2-14x +\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 + 3\\
& = x^2 -14x + 7^2 - 49 + 3\\
&=(x-7)^2 - 46.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $$(x-7)^2\ge 0,$$where $(x-7)^2 =0$ only if $x=7$.   Therefore, $(x-7)^2 - 46$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{7}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the minimum value of the quadratic expression $x^2-14x+3$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$ for the vertex of the parabola $ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=-14$, and $c=3$. 

Therefore, the value of $x$ that gives the minimum value for the quadratic expression is:

$$ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-14}{2(1)} = \boxed{7}$$

So the value of $x=7$ will give the minimum value of the quadratic expression $x^2-14x+3$.
