The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by finding $120\%$ of 30. Since percent means "out of 100", we have \begin{align*}
120\% \ \text{of} \ 30 &= \frac{120}{100} \cdot 30 = 36.
\end{align*} Similarly, we find that $130\%$ of 20 is \begin{align*}
130\% \ \text{of} \ 20 &= \frac{130}{100} \cdot 20 = 26.
\end{align*} Therefore, the positive difference between these two quantities is $$\left| 36-26 \right| = \boxed{10}.$$

First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_high_confidence_answers/1001_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer and $x$ is a fraction between two consecutive integers, we have $\lceil x \rceil - 1 < x \leq \lceil x \rceil$. Thus, \[\lceil x \rceil + x > \lceil x \rceil - 1 + \lceil x \rceil = 2\lceil x \rceil - 1.\]We therefore have \[2\lceil x \rceil -1 < \frac{23}{7},\]which implies $\lceil x \rceil < 3.5$. But since $\lceil x \rceil$ must be an integer, we have $\lceil x \rceil \leq 3$. Thus, we try each of the possible values of $\lceil x \rceil$ in turn. When $\lceil x \rceil = 1$, we have $1+x = \frac{23}{7}$, so $x = \frac{16}{7}$, which does not satisfy the inequality $\lceil x \rceil +x > 2\lceil x \rceil - 1$. When $\lceil x \rceil = 2$, we have $2+x = \frac{23}{7}$, so $x = \frac{9}{7}$, which satisfies the inequality. When $\lceil x \rceil = 3$, we have $3+x = \frac{23}{7}$, so $x = \frac{2}{7}$, which satisfies the inequality. Thus, the solutions are $x=\boxed{\frac{9}{7},\frac{2}{7}}$.

Stripped String: 
Since$\lceilx\rceil$isanintegerand$x$isafractionbetweentwoconsecutiveintegers,wehave$\lceilx\rceil-1<x\leq\lceilx\rceil$.Thus,\[\lceilx\rceil+x>\lceilx\rceil-1+\lceilx\rceil=2\lceilx\rceil-1.\]Wethereforehave\[2\lceilx\rceil-1<\frac{23}{7},\]whichimplies$\lceilx\rceil<3.5$.Butsince$\lceilx\rceil$mustbeaninteger,wehave$\lceilx\rceil\leq3$.Thus,wetryeachofthepossiblevaluesof$\lceilx\rceil$inturn.When$\lceilx\rceil=1$,wehave$1+x=\frac{23}{7}$,so$x=\frac{16}{7}$,whichdoesnotsatisfytheinequality$\lceilx\rceil+x>2\lceilx\rceil-1$.When$\lceilx\rceil=2$,wehave$2+x=\frac{23}{7}$,so$x=\frac{9}{7}$,whichsatisfiestheinequality.When$\lceilx\rceil=3$,wehave$3+x=\frac{23}{7}$,so$x=\frac{2}{7}$,whichsatisfiestheinequality.Thus,thesolutionsare$x=\boxed{\frac{9}{7},\frac{2}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the fact that $4=2^2$ to rewrite the equation as $2^8=(2^2)^x$. Then we can simplify by using the property of exponents that says $(a^b)^c=a^{bc}$. This gives us $2^8=2^{2x}$. 

Now we can use another property of exponents that says $a^b=a^c$ if and only if $b=c$. This means that we can set the exponents equal to each other: 

\begin{align*}
2^8&=2^{2x}\\
8&=2x\\
x&=\boxed{4}
\end{align*}

Therefore, $x=4$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_high_confidence_answers/1009_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
The common difference between consecutive terms is 10 - 6 = 4. Therefore, the nth term of the arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:

a(n) = a(1) + (n - 1)d

where a(1) is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number. 

For n = 100, we have:

a(100) = 6 + (100 - 1)4
a(100) = 6 + 99(4)
a(100) = 6 + 396
a(100) = 402

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we rearrange the inequality to be $x^2 - 5x - 14 \le 0$. Then, we can factor this expression as $(x - 7)(x + 2) \le 0$. 

The inequality holds true when the product of the two factors is non-positive, meaning that one factor is positive and the other is negative. This occurs when $-2 \le x \le 7$. 

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the interval $\boxed{[-2, 7]}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the amount of money Mr. Madoff's investment will grow to after three years can be calculated using the formula:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount (1000 dollars), r is the interest rate per compounding period (which is annually in this case), and n is the number of compounding periods (3 years).

Plugging in the values we know and solving for r, we get:

1225 = 1000(1 + r)^3
1.225 = (1 + r)^3
1 + r = (1.225)^(1/3)
r = (1.225)^(1/3) - 1
r ≈ 0.081

So the annual interest rate, as a decimal, is approximately 0.081. Converting to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer, we get:

r ≈ 8%

Therefore, the annual interest rate is approximately 8%.

WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_high_confidence_answers/1017_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's begin by finding the sum of all four integers. Adding all six possible pairs of the given sums, we get:

$$(a+b)+(c+d)=10+18+19+20+21+29=117$$

But we also know that each integer is distinct, so we can write:

$$(a+b)+(c+d)=a+b+c+d+a+b+c+d=2(a+b+c+d)$$

Therefore, we have:

$$2(a+b+c+d)=117$$

$$a+b+c+d=\frac{117}{2}=58.5$$

Now we need to use the given sums to determine the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Let's start with the sum of 29. We know that this is the largest sum we can get from two of the numbers, so one of the numbers must be 29 minus one of the other three numbers. Without loss of generality, assume $a$ is the largest of the four numbers. Then, we have:

$$a+b=29-c-d$$

Since $a$ is the largest number, we know that $29-c-d<a$, which means $a+b<a+a=2a$. So we have:

$$2a> a+b = 29-c-d$$

$$2a+c+d>29$$

Similarly, using the given sum of 10 and assuming $d$ is the smallest of the four numbers, we have:

$$a+d=10-b-c$$

Since $b$ and $c$ are both greater than $d$, we have:

$$2a>b+c+d$$

Adding these two inequalities, we get:

$$2a+c+d+10-b-c>29$$

$$2a+b+d>29$$

Using the given sum of 18 and assuming $a$ is the largest again, we have:

$$a+c=18-b-d$$

Remembering that $a>b+c+d$, we have:

$$2a<b+c+d+18$$

Adding this to the previous inequality, we get:

$$4a+2b+2d>75$$

Finally, using the sum of 20 and assuming $d$ is the smallest, we have:

$$b+d=20-a-c$$

We already know that $a<b+c+d$, so:

$$4d<20$$

$$d\leq 4$$

This means $b$ is at least 16, and since $b>c>d$ we also have $b\geq 18$.

Now we can use these inequalities to narrow down the possibilities for the integers. First, we know that $a$ is the largest, so we can try the integers from 28 down to 5 until we find one that satisfies all the inequalities. Let's try $a=28$:

$$2a+c+d>29$$

$$4a+2b+2d>75$$

These simplify to:

$$c+d>1$$

$$2b+2d>19$$

If $a=28$, then we have three integers whose sum is $30.5$. The smallest of these is $d$, and the other two add up to $30.5-d$. In order for $c+d>1$, $d$ must be 2, which means $b$ is at least 17. But then $2b+2d$ is at most 36, which is not greater than 19. So $a=28$ does not work.

Let's try $a=27$:

$$2a+c+d>29$$

$$4a+2b+2d>75$$

These simplify to:

$$c+d>1$$

$$2b+2d>21$$

If $a=27$, then we have three integers whose sum is $31.5$. The smallest of these is $d$, and the other two add up to $31.5-d$. In order for $c+d>1$, $d$ must be at least 3, which means $b$ is at least 18. But then $2b+2d$ is at least 42, which is greater than 21. So $a=27$ works.

Now we know that $a=27$. Using the given sum of 29, we know that one of the other three numbers is 2. Without loss of generality, assume $b$ is 18. Then we have:

$$c+d=11$$

Using the given sum of 19, we know that the other two numbers add up to 19 minus 2 or 17. It's easy to see that $c$ and $d$ must be 6 and 5 in some order, so we have:

$$a=27, b=18, c=6, d=5$$

These are the four integers in increasing order.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

We start by finding all $x$ satisfying $|x+1|\le7$, which is equivalent to $-7\le x+1\le 7$.  Solving these inequalities, we find $-8\le x \le 6$.

Next, we find all $x$ satisfying $|x|+1>7$.  We realize that this inequality is satisfied for all $x>6$ and $x<-6$, since in these ranges we have $|x|+1>x>6\ge7$ or $|x|+1>-x>6\ge7$.  We also note that $|x|+1>7$ is equivalent to $|x|>6$, which occurs when $x>6$ or $x<-6$.

Putting our two regions of solutions for $x$ together, we find that the sum of all integers satisfying both conditions is $-8-7-6-5-4-3-2+2+3+4+5+6= \boxed{-12}$.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between two points in a coordinate system. 

The distance formula is $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$. 

In this case, the first point is the origin, which has coordinates $(0,0)$ and the second point is $(-8,6)$. 

Thus, the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is $\sqrt{(-8-0)^2 + (6-0)^2} = \sqrt{64+36} = \sqrt{100} = 10$ units. 

Therefore, the distance from the origin to the point $(-8,6)$ is 10 units.

We first find the lengths of the diagonals of $ABCD.$ Diagonal $\overline{AC}$ has endpoints $(0,7)$ and $(12,-2)$, so its length is $\sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-2-7)^2} = \sqrt{170}.$

Diagonal $\overline{BD}$ has endpoints $(1,0)$ and $(7,8),$ so its length is $\sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10.$

Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

\begin{align*}
(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2 &= (x^2-6x+9)-(x^2-16x+64) \\

\end{align*}
For the square root to be defined, we need $-10x+55\geq 0$, or equivalently, $x\leq \frac{11}{2}$. Thus, the domain of $g(x)$ is $(-\infty, \frac{11}{2}]$. The function is continuous on this interval, and the only point where it could potentially become undefined is $x= \frac{11}{2}$, but we can see that $g\left(\frac{11}{2}\right) = \sqrt{(11/2-3)^2-(11/2-8)^2} = 0$.

We begin by simplifying the given equation. We can write $\frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$ as $\frac{9}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}=\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{6}$, which simplifies to $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}$. So we have \[\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}.\]Multiplying both sides by $\frac{2C}{\sqrt{B}}$, we get \[A\sqrt{B}\cdot\frac{2C}{\sqrt{B}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}\cdot 2C,\]which simplifies to $2AC\sqrt{B} = 3C\sqrt{3}$. Dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$ and simplifying, we get $2AC\cdot\frac{\sqrt{B}}{\sqrt{3}} = 3C$. Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are positive integers, the fraction $\frac{\sqrt{B}}{\sqrt{3}}$ must be rational. This means that $B$ must be a multiple of 3, but since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we must have $B=3$. 

Substituting $B=3$ into our equation $2AC\cdot\frac{\sqrt{B}}{\sqrt{3}} = 3C$, we get $2AC\sqrt{3} = 3C$, which simplifies to $\frac{2A}{C} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{3}$, we get $\frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{C} = 1$. Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, $C$ must divide $2A$. But $2A$ is even, so $C$ must be even. Since $A$ and $C$ are positive integers, this means that $C$ must be either 2 or 6. If $C=2$, then $\frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{C} = \frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{2} = A\sqrt{3} = 1$, which is impossible since $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational. So we must have $C=6$, and then $\frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{C} = \frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{A\sqrt{3}}{3} = 1$. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get $A\sqrt{3} = 3$, so $A=3/\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the weight of one treek "t", the weight of one squig "s", and the weight of one goolee "g". 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

10t = 3s + g 

From the second sentence, we know that: 

2t + g = s 

We want to find how many treeks equal the weight of one squig, which means we want to find the value of x in the equation: 

x * t = s 

We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate the variable "g": 

10t = 3(2t + g) + g 

10t = 6t + 4g 

4t = 4g 

t = g 

Now we can substitute t = g into the second equation: 

2t + g = s 

2t + t = s 

3t = s 

Finally, we can substitute 3t for s in the equation we want to solve for x: 

x * t = s 

x * t = 3t 

x = 3

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use proportions to solve this problem. Let x be the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Then:

8 ounces / 125 calories = 12 ounces / x calories

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

8/125 = 12/x

Cross-multiplying, we get:

8x = 125 * 12

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

x = (125 * 12) / 8 = 187.5

Therefore, there are approximately 187.5 calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water.

Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime roots. Then, we know that $m = p+q$ and $n = pq$. Since $m < 20$, the primes $p$ and $q$ must both be less than $20$.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\

Let $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the roots of the polynomial $x^2 - mx + n.$ Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime and $\text{degree}\ (x^2 - mx + n) = 2,$ it follows that $p_1 = 2$ and $p_2$ is an odd prime.
By Vieta's formulas, $p_1p_2 = n$ and $p_1+p_2 = m.$ Therefore, $$2 + p_2 = m.$$Since $p_2$ is odd, $m$ is even. It follows that the only possible values of $m$ are $10,12,14,16,18.$ For each possibility of $m,$ there is only one possible value of $p_2,$ since $p_2$ is the positive difference of $m$ and $2.$ Finally, we can compute the corresponding values of $n$ by multiplying $2$ by the odd prime factor $p_2.$ The possible values of $n$ are thus $2\cdot3=6, 2\cdot5=10, 2\cdot11=22, 2\cdot13=26,$ and $2\cdot17=34.$ This gives a total of $\boxed{5}$ possible values for $n.$

Since pressure and volume are inversely proportional, their product remains constant. This is known as Boyle's Law. Therefore, if we have P1V1 = P2V2, we can solve for P2 as follows:

P1V1 = P2V2

(4 kPa)(3.67 L) = P2(1.835 L)

P2 = (4 kPa)(3.67 L) / (1.835 L)

Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In order for the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant, $49-4c$, must be a perfect square. Writing $49-4c=n^2$, we have $c=\frac{49-n^2}{4}$.

Since $c$ is an integer, $n$ must be odd, say $n=2k+1$. Substituting, we have $c=\frac{(2k+1)(2k-1)}{4}=\frac{k^2-k}{2}$.

Therefore, $k$ must be odd. Let $k=2j+1$, then we have $c=\frac{(4j+1)(4j+3)}{2}=2j(4j+2)+\frac{3}{2}j+\frac{3}{2}$, which simplifies to $c=8j^2+7j+1$.

Thus, the possible values of $c$ are $c=8j^2+7j+1$ where $j$ is a positive integer. The first few values of $c$ are $1, 16, 43, 82, 133, \ldots$. These values form a sequence of odd squares plus one.

Therefore, the positive integer values of $c$ are $\boxed{253, 169, 121, 49, 1}$.

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to convert everything to the same unit. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we have:

- Eight pounds (128 ounces) of feathers and two ounces of gold cost $\$932$
- Fourteen pounds (224 ounces) of feathers and three ounces of gold cost $\$1402$

Let $f$ be the cost per ounce of feathers and $g$ be the cost per ounce of gold. Then we can set up a system of equations:

\begin{align*}
128f+2g&=932 \\
224f+3g&=1402 
\end{align*}

Solving for $f$ and $g$, we get $f=4$ and $g=450$. Therefore, the cost of five pounds (80 ounces) of feathers and five ounces of gold is:

$$5(80)(4) + 5(450) = 1600 + 2250 = \boxed{\$3850}$$

We can use the fact that any two points uniquely determine a line. Let $(2,-5)$ and $(p,-14)$ be points on the line. Then the slope of the line is $$\frac{-14-(-5)}{p-2} = \frac{-9}{p-2}.$$ Using either point and the slope, we can find that the equation of the line is $$y+5 = \frac{-9}{p-2}(x-2),$$ which simplifies to $$y= \frac{-9}{p-2}x + \frac{13p-23}{p-2}.$$ We know that $(p+2,-17)$ lies on this line. Substituting into the equation above yields $$-17= \frac{-9}{p-2}(p+2) + \frac{13p-23}{p-2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $p-2$ yields $$-17(p-2)=-9(p+2)+(13p-23).$$ Solving for $p$ gives $p=11.$

Therefore, the equation of the line is $$y= \frac{-9}{9}x + \frac{13\cdot11-23}{9} = -x+11.$$ Hence, $(13,q)$ lies on the line, so $q=-2.$ Therefore, $p+q = 11 - 2 = \boxed{9}.$

We can begin by factoring the inequality as follows: \begin{align*}
-4<x^4+4x^2<21 &\Rightarrow -4<(x^2+2)^2-8<(5)^2 \\
&\Rightarrow 0<(x^2+2)^2<29 \\
&\Rightarrow -\sqrt{29}-2<x^2+2<\sqrt{29}-2.
\end{align*} Note that we can negate the inequality on both sides and multiply by $-1$ to obtain the equivalent inequality \begin{align*}
\sqrt{29}-2>-x^2-2>-\sqrt{29}-2 &\Rightarrow \sqrt{29}-2>-1(x^2+2)>-\sqrt{29}-2 \\
&\Rightarrow \sqrt{29}-2>x^2+2>-\sqrt{29}-2 \\
&\Rightarrow -\sqrt{29}-2<x^2+2<\sqrt{29}-2.
\end{align*} Thus, $\boxed{(-\sqrt{29}-2,\sqrt{29}-2)}$ is the interval of real values of $x$ that satisfy the inequality.

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can see that $\sqrt 2 + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} = \frac{\sqrt 2 \cdot \sqrt 2 + 1}{\sqrt 2} = \frac{3\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 2} = 3$, and similarly $\sqrt 3 + \frac{1}{\sqrt 3} = \frac{\sqrt 3 \cdot \sqrt 3 + 1}{\sqrt 3} = \frac{4\sqrt 3}{\sqrt 3} = 4$. Therefore, we wish to simplify the expression $3 + 4 = 7$ in the form $\frac{a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3}}{c}$. Multiplying by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$ for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$ for $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, we get 
\[\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 3\sqrt{2} + 4\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}\cdot 4\sqrt{3} + 4\sqrt{3}\cdot 3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{3}} = \frac{24\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{3}} = 4\sqrt{6}.\]

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$. The maximum value of $y$ is achieved at the point on the top of the circle, which is located at $(7,24+25)=(7,49)$. Thus, the maximum value of $y$ is $\boxed{49}$.

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

Certainly! We can approach this problem by splitting it into two cases: one where $x-1$ is positive, and another where $x-1$ is negative.

1. $x-1$ is positive:
If $x-1$ is positive, we can simply write $|x-1|=x-1$. So, we have the equation $x-1=7$, which gives $x=8$.

2. $x-1$ is negative:
If $x-1$ is negative, we know that $|x-1|$ is simply the positive version of $x-1$, which means that $|x-1|=-(x-1)$. So, we have the equation $-(x-1)=7$, which simplifies to $-x+1=7$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=-6$.

The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
To maximize revenue, we need to find the price that maximizes the product of price and quantity sold, or $p(128-4p)$. Expanding this product gives $-4p^2+128p$, which is a quadratic function. Since the coefficient of $p^2$ is negative, this function has a maximum value at the vertex. The $p$ coordinate of the vertex is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=-4$ and $b=128$.

We start by simplifying the expression $\frac{4a + 3b}{a - 2b} = 5$ by cross-multiplying:
$$4a + 3b = 5(a - 2b)$$
$$4a + 3b = 5a -10b$$
$$13b = a$$

We can now substitute $a = 13b$ into the expression $\frac{a+11b}{a-b}$ to get:

$$\frac{a + 11b}{a - b} = \frac{13b + 11b}{13b - b} = \frac{24b}{12b} = \boxed{2}$$

Therefore, the simplified numerical value of the expression is $\boxed{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$, we need to find the point on the orange line that is farthest above the green line, and then subtract the $y$-coordinate of that point on the orange line from the $y$-coordinate of the corresponding point on the green line. We can estimate this point by simply looking at the graph and guessing where the farthest apart points are, but to get a more accurate answer, we can use calculus.

The function $f(x)-g(x)$ is maximized at a point where its derivative is $0$. So, we take the derivative of $f(x)-g(x)$:

\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx} \left(f(x)-g(x)\right) &= \frac{d}{dx} \left(10+\frac{1}{8}(x-6)^2-\frac{1}{6}(x-10)^3 - (12-x)\right)\\
&= \frac{1}{4}(x-6) - \frac{1}{2}(x-10)^2 + 1\\
&= -\frac{1}{2}(x-10)^2 + \frac{1}{4}(x-6) + 1\\
&= -\frac{1}{2}x^2+5x-7.
\end{align*}

Setting this equal to $0$ and solving for $x$ gives us $x=5$ or $x=7$. We check the $y$-coordinates at $x=5$ and $x=7$ and find that $f(5)-g(5)=2$ and $f(7)-g(7)=1$, so the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ is $\boxed{2}$.

We have that $f(f(x))=x$.  Since $f$ is invertible, $f$ must be one-to-one and onto.

From the equation $f(f(x))=x$, we can conclude that $f$ is its own inverse.  That is, $f^{-1}(x)=f(x)$.

Substituting this into the expression $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)$, we get $f(x)-f(f(x))$.  But since $f(f(x))=x$, we have $f(x)-x$.  And since $f$ is one-to-one and onto, we know that $f(x)-x=0$ for all $x$.

Therefore, $f(x)-f^{-1}(x)=\boxed{0}$ for all $x$.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)

\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

P &= 70t - [70\cdot 60 + (70-n)n + (t-60-n)(70-n)]\\ &= 70t - [4200 + 70n - n^2 + (t-60-n)(70-n)]\\ &= -n^2 + (t-n-60)(70-n).
\end{align*}We're interested in finding the maximum $t$ which gives $P > 4200$. Hence we solve the inequality $P > 4200.$ We can factor the quadratic to write \[P = -(n-35)^2 + (t-95)(65-n).\]Thus $-(n-35)^2 < P \le -n^2+(t-n-60)(70-n)$ so $(n-35)^2 > n^2 - (t-n-60)(70-n).$ Since we want the maximum value of $t$, we want to minimize the product $(t-n-60)(70-n)$, hence we choose the smallest integer value of $n$ such that this inequality holds. We find that $n=20$ and therefore \[(t-75)\cdot 50 > 15^2 \implies t > 94.\]The largest integer $t$ satisfying this inequality is $t = \boxed{95}$.

We begin by simplifying the expression inside the logarithm using the product rule for radicals: $$64\sqrt{8}=64\cdot\sqrt{8\cdot8}=64\cdot8\cdot\sqrt{2}=512\sqrt{2}.$$ We can then write the original expression as \begin{align*}
\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})&=\log_{\sqrt8}(512\sqrt{2})\\
&=\log_{2^{\frac32}}(512\sqrt{2})\quad\text{(change of base formula)}\\
&=\frac{\log_2(512\sqrt2)}{\log_2(\sqrt8)}\quad\text{(change of base formula)}\\

First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

By the quadratic formula, the solutions to this equation are given by $$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25-4n}}{2}.$$ For this equation to have no real solutions, we must have $25-4n<0$. This means $n>6.25$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $f(4) = 3$, we know that $f^{-1}(3) = 4$, since $f^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse of $f(x)$. Therefore, we need to find $f^{-1}(4)$. 

We know that $f(1) = 2$ and $f(4) = 3$, so the graph of $f(x)$ must be increasing between $x=1$ and $x=4$. Similarly, we know that $f(4) = 3$ and $f(7) = 4$, so the graph of $f(x)$ must be increasing between $x=4$ and $x=7$.

This tells us that there is only one possible value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 4$, and that value is $x=7$. Therefore, $f^{-1}(4) = 7$, and $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3)) = f^{-1}(4) = \boxed{7}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The minimum value of a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$ occurs at the vertex $(\frac{-b}{2a}, f(\frac{-b}{2a}))$. 

In this case, our quadratic function is $f(x) = x^2 - 14x + 3$. Using the formula above, we have that $\frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{14}{2} = 7$. 

So, the minimum value occurs when $x=7$. Plugging this value into the function, we get: 

$f(7) = 7^2 - 14(7) + 3 = -88$. 

Therefore, the minimum value of the function $x^2- 14x + 3$ is $-88$ and it occurs at $x = 7$.
