The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function such as $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we must look for values of $x$ that make the denominator equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined. 

The denominator of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ factors as $(x-2)(x+3)$, so the function is undefined when $x=2$ or $x=-3$. Thus, the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has two vertical asymptotes, one at $x=2$ and the other at $x=-3$.

First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If $n$ is an integer, then $\lceil x \rceil \geq n$ if and only if $x \geq n$. Otherwise, $\lceil x \rceil$ is the smallest integer greater than $x$. Thus we have two cases:

Case 1: $\lceil x \rceil = x+1$. Then $2x + 1 = \dfrac{23}{7}$, which gives $x = \boxed{\dfrac{8}{7}}$.

Case 2: $\lceil x \rceil = x$. Then $2x = \dfrac{23}{7}$, which gives $x = \dfrac{23}{14}$. But in this case, $\lceil x \rceil = 2$, which is not equal to $x$. Therefore, this case can be ignored.

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and .

Extracting Answer from: 
We can solve for $x$ by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation using any base, as long as we use the same base for both sides. Let's use base 2. Then we have:

$$\log_2 2^8 = \log_2 4^x$$

Using the property $\log_a b^c = c\log_a b$ for any positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, we can simplify both sides of the equation:

$$8\log_2 2 = x\log_2 4$$

Since $\log_2 2 = 1$ and $\log_2 4 = 2$, we can substitute these values in the equation above and simplify:

$$8\cdot1 = x\cdot2$$

$$8 = 2x$$

Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us the solution:

$$x = 4$$

Therefore, $x=4$ is the value that satisfies $2^8=4^x$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ..., we need to find the common difference first. We can see that each term is 4 numbers greater than the previous term. Therefore, the common difference is 4.

So, the 100th term can be calculated using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d

where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number we want to find.

Using this formula, we get:

a_100 = 6 + (100 - 1)4
a_100 = 6 + 396
a_100 = 402

Therefore, the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence 6, 10, 14, 18, ... is 402.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the formula for compound interest: $A=P\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}$ where $A$ is the amount after $t$ years with an initial investment of $P$, an interest rate of $r$, compounded $n$ times per year. We are given $A=1225$, $P=1000$, $t=3$ and $n=1$ (compounded annually).  Solving for $r$ gives:

\begin{align*}
1225 &= 1000\left(1+\frac{r}{1}\right)^{(1)(3)}\\
\frac{1225}{1000} &= \left(1+r\right)^3\\
\sqrt[3]{\frac{1225}{1000}} &= 1+r\\
r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{1225}{1000}}-1\\
&\approx 0.095
\end{align*}

Converting this to a percentage and rounding to the nearest integer gives an annual interest rate of $\boxed{10\%}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \begin{align*}\tag{1}
a+b&=10\\ \tag{2}
a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

We can organize the given information in a table:

\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}

$b+d$ &  & 20 & 21 & 29 \\
$c+d$ &  &  & 29 &
\end{tabular}

We notice that $a+d$ is 29, and the only other number that can be written as a sum of two numbers that add up to 29 is $b+c$. Therefore, $b+c$ is 20. Using this information, we can fill out the rest of the table:

\begin{tabular}{c|cccccc}
 & $a$ & $b$ & $c$ & $d$ \\ \hline
$a+b$ & 10 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\

$b+d$ &  & 20 & 21 & 29 \\
$c+d$ &  &  & 29 &
\end{tabular}

Now we look at the row and column that have not been fully filled in. The missing number in the row must be the sum of the two missing numbers in the column. Therefore, $c+d$ is 29.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a few different cases to consider depending on the sign of $5x-1$ and $3x+2$. One relatively easy way to proceed is to square both sides of the equation, which preserves the solutions but eliminates the absolute values. We have:

\[(5x-1)^2 = (3x+2)^2\]
\[25x^2 - 10x + 1 = 9x^2 + 12x + 4\]
\[16x^2 - 22x - 3 = 0\]
\[(4x+1)(4x-3) = 0\]

Therefore, the solutions are $x=-\frac{1}{4}$ and $x=\frac{3}{4}$. We can check that these values work in the original equation:

\[|5\cdot (-1/4) - 1| = |-3/4-2| = 13/4\]
\[|5\cdot (3/4) - 1| = |15/4-2| = 13/4\]

So both solutions satisfy the equation.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

Extracting Answer from: 
Starting with $|x|+1>7$, we have $|x|>6$; this means that $x$ must be a nonzero integer whose absolute value is greater than $6$.  The only such integers are $x=7$, $x=-7$, $x=8$, and $x=-8$.  These candidates should be checked to see which ones also satisfy $|x+1|\le 7$.  We can proceed systematically as follows: \begin{align*}
|x+1|&\le 7\quad\Rightarrow\\
-7&\le x+1\le 7\quad\Rightarrow\\
-8&\le x\le 6.
\end{align*}Thus, the only integers among $x=7$, $x=-7$, $x=8$, and $x=-8$ that satisfy $|x+1| \le 7$ are $x=-7$ and $x=6$.  Therefore, the answer to the problem is $(-7)+6=\boxed{-1}$.

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we can simplify the expression under the square root: $$\sqrt{(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2}=\sqrt{(x-3)^2-[(x-8)(x-8)]}.$$ Expanding the square in the second term, we have $$\sqrt{(x-3)^2-(x^2-16x+64)}=\sqrt{x^2-22x+25}.$$ The expression under the square root is equal to $(x-11)^2-6$, which is non-negative when $x\geq 11-\sqrt{6}$ or $x\leq 11+\sqrt{6}$. Thus, the domain of $g$ is given by $11-\sqrt{6} \leq x \leq 11+\sqrt{6}$. 

The minimum value of $g(x)$ occurs at the endpoint(s) of the domain. Plugging in $x=11+\sqrt{6}$ gives $g(x) = \sqrt{(11+\sqrt{6}-3)^2-(11+\sqrt{6}-8)^2}=2\sqrt{6}-\sqrt{10}.$ Plugging in $x=11-\sqrt{6}$ gives $g(x)=0$. Therefore, the smallest value of $x$ for which $g(x)$ is defined is $x=\boxed{11-\sqrt{6}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We start by simplifying the given expression:
$$\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{2A\sqrt{3}}{C} = 9\sqrt{B}$$
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$\frac{4A^2\times 3}{C^2} = 81B$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{A^2 \times 4\times 3}{C^2} = 81B$$
Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, this means that $A^2$ and $C^2$ have no common prime factors. Therefore, $B$ must be divisible by $4 \times 3$, i.e. $12$.
Let $B = 12k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Substituting this in the previous equation and simplifying yields:
$$A^2 = 27k^2C^2$$
Since $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, this means that $C^2$ must be a multiple of $27$, i.e. $C = 3m$ for some positive integer $m$. Substituting this in the previous equation yields:
$$A^2 = 27\times 9k^2m^2 = 243k^2m^2$$
Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, this means that $k$ and $m$ have no common factors. Therefore, $A$ must be a multiple of $3k$, i.e. $A = 3nk$ for some positive integer $n$.
Substituting all these values back into the original expression, we get:
$$\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{3nk\times k}{3m} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{nk^2}{m} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
Since $k$ and $m$ have no common factors, this means that $m$ must be equal to 2, and $nk^2$ must be equal to $\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $k = \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{n}}$.
Since $k$ is a positive integer, this means that $n$ must be equal to 1. Therefore, $k = \sqrt{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt[4]{3}$. Substituting all these values back in the original expression, we get:
$$\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\Rightarrow \frac{3\times 1\times \sqrt[4]{3}\times \sqrt{12}}{2\times 3} = \frac{\sqrt{27}}{2\sqrt{3}}$$
$$\Rightarrow A+B+C = 3+12+2 = \boxed{17}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's assign variables to represent the weights of the three creatures: 

- Let t be the weight of one treek 
- Let s be the weight of one squig 
- Let g be the weight of one goolee 

From the given information, we can form the following equations: 

- 10t = 3s + g      (Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee) 
- 2t + g = s         (Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig) 

We want to find the combined weight of how many treeks equals the weight of one squig, which is asking us to solve for some integer multiple of t that equals s. So we want to find some integer n such that nt = s. 

From the second equation, we can solve for g: 

g = s - 2t 

And we can substitute that into the first equation: 

10t = 3s + (s - 2t) 

10t = 4s - 2t 

12t = 4s 

3t = s 

So n = 3, which means that three treeks weigh the same as one squig.

We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\frac{125}{8}=\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\left(\frac{125}{8}\right)(12)=\boxed{187.5}$ calories.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can set up a proportionality between the calories and the fluid ounces:

$$\frac{125 \text{ calories}}{8 \text{ fl oz}} = \frac{x \text{ calories}}{12 \text{ fl oz}}$$

where $x$ is the number of calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. We can solve for $x$ by cross-multiplying:

$$125 \cdot 12 = 8 \cdot x$$

$$x = \frac{125 \cdot 12}{8} = 187.5$$

Therefore, there would be 187.5 calories in a 12 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water.

Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime roots. Then, we know that $m = p+q$ and $n = pq$. Since $m < 20$, the primes $p$ and $q$ must both be less than $20$.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $p$ and $q$ be the two roots of the polynomial $x^2-mx+n$. Then $p+q=m$ and $pq=n$. Since $p$ and $q$ are positive primes, it follows that $p=2$ and $q$ is an odd prime, or vice versa. Therefore, $m$ is odd.

If $p=q$, then $m=2p$ is even and hence $m\geq 22$, which contradicts our assumption that $m<20$. Therefore, $p\neq q$, which implies that


1. $p=2$ and $q$ is an odd prime,


or


2. $p$ is an odd prime and $q=2$.


In the first case, we have $q= m-2$ and $n=pq=2q=2(m-2)$, so $m$ must be a multiple of $4$. Thus $m=4,8,12,16$, and these lead to $n=8,24,40,56$, respectively.

In the second case, we have $p=m-2$ and $n=pq=p(m-2)$, so $p$ must be even, which is impossible. Therefore, there are a total of $\boxed{4}$ possible values of $n$.

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$. Thus, we have the equations $49-4c=1$, $49-4c=9$, and $49-4c=25$. Solving, we get that the positive integer values of c are $\boxed{12, 10, 6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $r$ and $s$ be the roots of the quadratic. Then, the sum and product of these roots are $r+s=7$ and $rs=c$. We want $r$ and $s$ to be rational, so by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational roots must be of the form $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ divides $c$ and $q$ divides 1. Since $rs$ is an integer, both $r$ and $s$ must be integers themselves.

Let $r=p_1/q_1$ and $s=p_2/q_2$ where $p_1,p_2$ divide $c$ and $q_1,q_2$ divide 1. Then, $7=p_1/q_1 + p_2/q_2 = \frac{p_1q_2+p_2q_1}{q_1q_2}$. This implies $q_1q_2$ divides $p_1q_2+p_2q_1$.

Now note that we can write $c$ as the square of a rational number since $r,s$ are rational: $c=\left(\frac{p_1}{q_1}\right)\left(\frac{p_2}{q_2}\right)=\frac{p_1p_2}{q_1q_2}$. Then, $q_1q_2$ divides $c$, so $q_1q_2$ divides $p_1p_2$.

Suppose that $p_1$ and $p_2$ share no common prime factors, and similarly $q_1$ and $q_2$ share no common prime factors. Then, $q_1q_2$ divides $p_1p_2$ implies that $q_1$ divides $p_1$ or $q_1$ divides $p_2$, and similarly for $q_2$. Thus, $r$ and $s$ can be written as fractions with a common denominator, so their sum is also a rational number with that denominator. But this contradicts the fact that $r+s$ equals $7$, a non-rational number. Thus, $p_1$ and $p_2$, or $q_1$ and $q_2$ (or both) share a common prime factor.

If $c$ is a perfect square, then $r$ and $s$ share a common factor, so $c$ must be of the form $k^2$, where $k$ is a positive integer. The possible values of $c$ are $c=36,25,16,9,4,1$.

If $c$ is not a perfect square, then since $c$ is integral, it must have at least two distinct prime factors (they can't all cancel in the equation $rs=c$). Thus, the two possibilities for factorizations of $c$ are $c=pq$ or $c=p^3$ where $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes. In the first case, since $r$ and $s$ share no common factor, we may assume that $r=p/q$ and $s=q/p$, so that $rq=1$. But then $r+s$ is not an integer, so there are no solutions in this case. In the second case, we let $r=s=p$ and so $p+p=7$ giving us the solution $c=216$.

For this problem, we make use of the correspondence between sums/products of roots and coefficients of a polynomial.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of this equation. We know that $r_1/r_2 = 3/1$ or $r_2/r_1 = 1/3$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $r_1 + r_2 = -b$ and $r_1r_2 = 48$. Thus, we have two cases: $r_1 = 3r_2$ and $r_2 = 3r_1$. 

In the first case, we have $r_1 + r_2 = -b$ and $r_1r_2 = 48$, or $r_2 = r_1/3$ and $r_1 + r_1/3 = -b$, which simplifies to $r_1 = -\frac{3b}{4}$. Substituting into $r_1r_2 = 48$, we get $r_2 = -\frac{16}{b}$, and so $r_1/r_2 = \frac{3b}{16} = 3/1$, or $b = \frac{16}{3}$. 

In the second case, we have $r_1 + r_2 = -b$ and $r_1r_2 = 48$, or $r_1 = 3r_2$ and $3r_2 + r_2 = -b$, which simplifies to $r_2 = -\frac{b}{4}$ and $r_1 = -\frac{3b}{4}$. Substituting into $r_1r_2 = 48$, we get $b^2/16 = 48$, so $b = \pm 16\sqrt{3}$. However, we need the negative root because $r_1/r_2 = 3/1$, so $b = -16\sqrt{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the cost of one pound of feathers be $f$ and the cost of one ounce of gold be $g$. Then, we can set up a system of two equations:

$$8f + 2g = 932$$
$$14f + 3g = 1402$$

To solve for $f$ and $g$, we can multiply the first equation by $3$ and subtract it from the second equation multiplied by $2$. This gives us:

$$(2 \cdot 14 - 3 \cdot 8) f + (2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 2) g = 2 \cdot 1402 - 3 \cdot 932$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$-2f + g = 46$$

Similarly, we can multiply the first equation by $7$ and subtract it from the second equation multiplied by $4$ to get:

$$(4 \cdot 14 - 7 \cdot 8) f + (4 \cdot 3 -7 \cdot 2) g = 4 \cdot 1402 - 7 \cdot 932$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$f + 3g = 622$$

Now we have two equations in two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination. For simplicity, we'll use substitution. Solving the first equation for $g$, we get:

$$g = 46 + 2f$$

Substituting this expression for $g$ into the second equation, we get:

$$f + 3(46 + 2f) = 622$$

Simplifying and solving for $f$, we get:

$$f = 138$$

Substituting this value for $f$ into our expression for $g$, we get:

$$g = 46 + 2(138) = 322$$

Therefore, the cost of five pounds of feathers and five ounces of gold is:

$$5f + 5g = 5(138) + 5(322) = \boxed{2300}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the radius of this circle, we need to complete the square. First, we group the $x$ terms and the $y$ terms together, and move the constant term to the right-hand side:

\begin{align*}
x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y &= 0 \\
(x^2 + 8x) + (y^2 - 6y) &= 0 \\
(x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) &= 0 + 16 + 9 \\
(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= 25
\end{align*}

Now we see that the equation is of the form $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r^2$, where $(a,b)$ is the center of the circle and $r$ is the radius. We can read off the center and radius from the completed square form:

Center: $(-4,3)$

Radius: $r = \sqrt{25} = 5$

Therefore, the radius of the circle is 5.

The slope of a line passing through the points $(2,-5)$ and $(p,-14)$ is $(-14-(-5))/(p-2)=-9/(p-2)$, and the slope of a line passing through the points $(p,-14)$ and $(p+2,-17)$ is $-3/2$ (check this using the slope formula). Thus $-9/(p-2)=-3/2$. Solving yields $p=8$. Again, since $(2,-5)$, $(8,-14)$, and $(10,-17)$ are all points on the same line, the slope must be $(-14-(-5))/(8-2)=-9/6=-3/2$, so the equation for the line is $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}$. Consequently, $q=-\frac{3}{2}(13)+\frac{1}{2}=-\frac{38}{2}=-19$, and $p+q=8-19=\boxed{-11}$.

The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\frac{3}{5}$ (you can choose any two consecutive terms and divide the second one by the first to find the common ratio). So the $n^\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$
\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{7} = \frac{5^3}{3^2} \cdot \frac{3^7}{5^7}
= \frac{3^5}{5^4}

Dividing both sides by $3^{36}$ results in $3^{36n-36}=1$.

Since $3^0=1$ for any number, we have $36n-36=0$ or $n=\boxed{1}$.

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

We can rewrite the inequality as $-4<x^{4}+4x^{2}$ and $x^{4}+4x^{2}<21$ separately. For the first inequality, we can factor the left-hand side as $x^{4}+4x^{2}+4-4=(x^{2}+2)^{2}-4$ and then solve $(x^{2}+2)^{2}-4<-4$ to get $-2\sqrt{2}<x<2\sqrt{2}$ as the solution. For the second inequality, we can factor the left-hand side as $x^{4}+4x^{2}-21=(x^{2}-3)(x^{2}+7)$ and then solve $(x^{2}-3)(x^{2}+7)<0$ to get $-\sqrt{7}<x<-\sqrt{3}$ or $\sqrt{3}<x<\sqrt{7}$ as the solution. Putting these together, the solution is $-\sqrt{7}<x<-2\sqrt{2}$ or $\sqrt{3}<x<2\sqrt{2}$, which we can express in interval notation as $\boxed{(-\sqrt{7},-2\sqrt{2})\cup (\sqrt{3},2\sqrt{2})}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can write $\sqrt{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{3} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$ as $(\sqrt{2}+ \sqrt{3}) + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. 

To get a common denominator for the last two terms, we can multiply by $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}}$ to get $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{3}} + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3\sqrt{2}}$. 

Combining this with $\sqrt{2}+ \sqrt{3}$ gives $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2\sqrt{3}} + \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3\sqrt{2}} + \sqrt{2}+ \sqrt{3}$. 

Now we need to simplify this expression to the desired form. To do this, we can first get a common denominator of $6\sqrt{6}$ for the first two terms by multiplying the first term by $\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}}$ and the second term by $\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{3\sqrt{3}}$. This gives us $\frac{2\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{6\sqrt{6}}$. 

Adding this to $\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$, we have $\frac{2\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{6\sqrt{6}}+\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$. To get a common denominator for this expression, we multiply the first term by $\frac{\sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{6}}$ to get $\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6\cdot 6}$. 

Adding this to $\frac{6\sqrt{2}+6\sqrt{3}}{6}$, we get $\frac{2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}+6\sqrt{2}+6\sqrt{3}}{6\sqrt{6}}$. 

Simplifying the numerator, we have $2\sqrt{12}+3\sqrt{18}+6\sqrt{2}+6\sqrt{3}=8\sqrt{3}+6\sqrt{2}+9\sqrt{2}+6\sqrt{3}$. 

Combining like terms, we get $14\sqrt{2}+14\sqrt{3}$. Thus, $a+b+c=14+2+3=\boxed{19}$.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

By considering the expression $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ for the roots of $ax^2+bx+c$, we find that the roots are real and distinct if and only if the discriminant $b^2-4ac$ is positive. So the roots of $2x^2+mx+8$ are real and distinct when $m^2-4(2)(8) > 0$.  Simplifying and factoring the left-hand side, we find $(m-8)(m+8) > 0$, which implies $m\in \boxed{(-\infty,-8)\cup (8,\infty)}$.

We can use the discriminant of the quadratic formula to determine if the quadratic equation $2x^2+mx+8$ has two distinct real roots.  The discriminant is $$\Delta=b^2-4ac=m^2-4(2)(8)=m^2-64.$$ We know that $\Delta>0$ because there are two distinct real roots, so we have $$m^2-64>0.$$  Solving this inequality, we find $$m<-8\sqrt{2} \ \text{ or } \ m>8\sqrt{2}.$$  Therefore, the values of $m$ that result in a quadratic equation with two distinct real roots are $m\in (-\infty, -8\sqrt{2}) \cup (8\sqrt{2}, \infty)$.

To find the value of $b$ when $a=4$, we need to substitute $a=4$ into the equation of the line and solve for $b$. We have:

$3(4) + 2y = 12$

$12 + 2y = 12$

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:

$2y = 0$

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

$y = 0$

Extracting Answer from: 
The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
To maximize revenue, we need to find the price that will result in the greatest product of price and quantity sold per month. In other words, we want to find the value of $p$ that maximizes the function $(128-4p)p$.

Expanding this expression, we get

$$(128-4p)p = -4p^2 +128p.$$

To find the maximum value of this quadratic function, we can use the fact that the maximum occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a=-4$ and $b=128$ from our quadratic expression.

So the value of $p$ that maximizes revenue is

$$p = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{128}{2(-4)} = 16.$$

Since $p$ must be less than or equal to $32$, we see that the optimal price for the book is $\boxed{16}$ dollars.

Note that this result makes sense: if the price is too low (i.e., less than $16$ dollars), then increasing the price will increase revenue, while if the price is too high (i.e., greater than $16$ dollars), then decreasing the price will increase revenue.

We can measure $|f(x)-g(x)|$ as the vertical distance between the two graphs at $x$. The sign of $f(x)-g(x)$ is positive if $f(x)>g(x)$, so we focus on the part of the graph where the dashed orange line lies above the solid dark green line. Within this part of the graph, the greatest vertical distance between the orange and green lines is $\boxed{4}$ (achieved for all $x$ from $8$ to $12$).

Extracting Answer from: 
We can find the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ by finding the point where the orange dashed line intersects the green solid line, and then taking the maximum value of $f(x)-g(x)$ to the left and right of that intersection point.

To find the intersection point, we can solve $f(x) = g(x)$ to get:

\begin{align*}
x^2 &= (18 - x)^2 \\
x^2 &= 324 - 36x + x^2 \\
36x &= 324 \\
x &= 9
\end{align*}

So the intersection point is $(9, 8)$.

We can then evaluate $f(x)-g(x)$ to the left and right of $x=9$:

\begin{align*}
f(x) - g(x) &= \begin{cases}
2x-2 & \text{if } 0\le x<9 \\
4-x & \text{if } 9\le x\le 18
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

The maximum value of $f(x)-g(x)$ to the left of $x=9$ is attained at $x=8$, where $f(x)-g(x) = 2(8)-2 = 14$. The maximum value of $f(x)-g(x)$ to the right of $x=9$ is attained at $x=18$, where $f(x)-g(x) = 4 - 18 = -14$. Thus, the largest value of $f(x)-g(x)$ is $\boxed{14}$.

The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $987 - 1000= -13$, so the $n^{\text{th}}$ term in this sequence is $1000 - 13(n - 1) = 1013 - 13n$.  This expression is positive if and only if $1013 - 13n > 0$, or \[n < \frac{1013}{13} = 77 + \frac{12}{13}.\] Since $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \le 77$.  Hence, the least positive integer in this sequence corresponds to the value $n = 77$, in which case $1013 - 13n = 1013 - 13 \cdot 77 = \boxed{12}$.

Each term is decreased by $13$ from the previous one. So $(1000 - x) / 13$ must be an integer (with $x$ between $0$ and $12$). Trying $x = 8,$ we have $(1000 - 8)/13 = 76,$ so the $76\text{th}$ term is the first one in the sequence that is a positive integer. So the first term is $1000 - 75 \cdot 13 = \boxed{925}.$

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)
\\4200&<(130-t)(t)
\\4200&<130t-t^2
\\\Rightarrow\qquad t^2-130t+4200&<0
\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $c$ be the initial cost of a ticket, and $x$ be the number of tickets bought beyond the $60$-ticket threshold, so the cost per ticket is $c - x$. Then we can write the revenue for selling $t$ tickets as a piecewise function:
\begin{align*}
R(t) = \begin{cases}
70t & \text{if } t \le 60 \\
(70 \cdot 60) + (c - x)(t - 60) & \text{if } t > 60
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
The amusement park will make a profit if $R(t) > 4200$. Substituting in our expressions for $R(t)$, we get
\begin{align*}
70t &> 4200 \\
(70 \cdot 60) + (c - x)(t - 60) &> 4200
\end{align*}
Solving the first inequality gives $t > 60$. For the second inequality, we want to find the largest $t$ such that it is satisfied. Simplifying and rearranging gives
\begin{align*}
ct - 60x &> 300 \\
t &> \frac{300 + 60x}{c}
\end{align*}
We want the largest integer $t$ satisfying this inequality, so we take the floor of the right-hand side to get
\begin{align*}
t &> \left\lfloor \frac{300 + 60x}{c} \right\rfloor.
\end{align*}
Finally, since $t$ must be greater than $60$, the largest integer $t$ that satisfies both inequalities is
\begin{align*}
t &= \left\lfloor \frac{300 + 60x}{c} \right\rfloor + 1.
\end{align*}
We want to maximize $t$, so we want to choose the highest possible value for $x$. We can see that $c$ must be at most $69$, since any higher and the initial price per ticket would be greater than the discounted price for up to $60$ tickets. Thus, we have $x \le c - 69$. Substituting this into our expression for $t$, we get
\begin{align*}
t &\le \left\lfloor \frac{330 - 60c}{c} \right\rfloor.
\end{align*}
We want to find the largest integer $t$ satisfying this inequality and the inequality $t > 60$, so we try the floor value of $\frac{330 - 60c}{c}$ first. If this is less than or equal to $60$, then $t$ must be $61$. Otherwise, we decrement the floor value until we get an acceptable value for $t$. For example, if $c = 65$, then
\begin{align*}
\left\lfloor \frac{330 - 60c}{c} \right\rfloor &= \left\lfloor \frac{30}{13} \right\rfloor = 2,
\end{align*}
so we have $t \le 2$. The largest $t$ satisfying both inequalities is $t = 61$, which occurs when $c = 69$. Thus, the largest $t$ which will bring the amusement park a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $\boxed{61}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that $x(x+5)=-n$ can be rewritten as $x^2+5x+n=0$. To find the probability that there are no real solutions to this equation, we can look at the discriminant of the quadratic: $\Delta = 5^2-4\cdot1\cdot n = 25-4n$. For the equation to have no real solutions, we need $\Delta < 0$, so $25-4n < 0$. Solving for $n$, we get $n > 6\frac{1}{4}$.

Since $n$ can only take on integer values from $1$ to $10$, we see that the only possible values for $n$ that satisfy $n > 6\frac{1}{4}$ are $7$, $8$, $9$, and $10$. Therefore, there are $4$ values of $n$ for which the equation has no real solutions, out of a total of $10$ possible values of $n$. Thus, the probability is $\frac{4}{10} = \boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

We start by finding $f^{-1}(3)$, which means finding the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 3$. Since we know $f(4)=3$, we have $f^{-1}(3) = 4$.  

Now we need to find $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3))$. We just found that $f^{-1}(3) = 4$, so we need to find $f^{-1}(4)$. To do that, we need to find the value of $x$ such that $f(x) = 4$. Looking at the given values of $f(x)$, we see that $f(7)=4$, so $f^{-1}(4)=7$. 

Therefore, $f^{-1}(f^{-1}(3)) = f^{-1}(4) = \boxed{7}$.

We can use the FOIL method to multiply these two complex numbers:

\begin{align*}
(3-i)(6+2i) &= 3(6) + 3(2i) -i(6) -i(2i) \\
&= 18 + 6i -6i -2i^2 \\
&= 18 - 2(-1) \\
&= 20.

We start by completing the square: \begin{align*}
x^2-14x+3&= x^2-14x +\left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{14}{2}\right)^2 + 3\\
& = x^2 -14x + 7^2 - 49 + 3\\
&=(x-7)^2 - 46.\end{align*}Since the square of a real number is at least 0, we have $$(x-7)^2\ge 0,$$where $(x-7)^2 =0$ only if $x=7$.   Therefore, $(x-7)^2 - 46$ is minimized when $x=\boxed{7}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
There are different methods to find the value of $x$ that minimizes a quadratic function, but one common way is to use the completing the square technique. Here's how it works:

First, we rewrite the quadratic function in the vertex form:
$$
x^2-14x + 3 = (x-7)^2 - 46
$$
To see why this is true, we can complete the square by adding and subtracting $(14/2)^2=49$ inside the parenthesis:
\begin{align*}
x^2- 14x + 3 &= x^2- 14x + 49 - 46 \\
&= (x-7)^2 - 46
\end{align*}

Note that the term $-46$ is the value of the quadratic function at the vertex, which occurs at $x=7$ (since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, the parabola opens upwards and the vertex is a minimum). Therefore, the minimum value of the function is 
$$
(x-7)^2 - 46 \ge -46
$$
which is achieved when $x=7$.
