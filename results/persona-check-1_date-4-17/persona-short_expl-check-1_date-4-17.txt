The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\lceil x \rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\lceil x \rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\lceil x \rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\dfrac{2}{7}=\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\dfrac{2}{7}=\boxed{\dfrac{9}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$$\lceil x\rceil + x = \frac{23}{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lceil x \rceil = \frac{23}{7} - x.$$Since $\lceil x \rceil$ is an integer, we must have $0 \leq \frac{23}{7} - x < 1.$ Then, 
$$0 \leq \frac{23}{7} - x < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad -1 < -\frac{16}{7} \leq -x < -\frac{9}{7} < 0.$$From the last inequality $-\frac{16}{7} \leq -x < -\frac{9}{7}$, adding $\frac{16}{7}$ to both sides, we have $$0 \leq \frac{16}{7} - x < \frac{7}{7} $$or $$0\leq x-\frac{16}{7} < 1.$$ Combining this with $-\frac{9}{7} < -x < 0$, we get $$-\frac{9}{7} < -x \leq 0 \leq x - \frac{16}{7} < 1.$$Therefore $-\frac{9}{7} < -x$ and $x - \frac{16}{7} < 1$, which yields $$\frac{9}{7} > x > \frac{16}{7} - 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{9}{7} > x > \frac{9}{7}.$$The only possible value for $x$ that satisfies the condition is $x = \boxed{\frac{9}{7}}.$

Stripped String: 
$$\lceilx\rceil+x=\frac{23}{7}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\lceilx\rceil=\frac{23}{7}-x.$$Since$\lceilx\rceil$isaninteger,wemusthave$0\leq\frac{23}{7}-x<1.$Then,$$0\leq\frac{23}{7}-x<1\quad\Rightarrow\quad-1<-\frac{16}{7}\leq-x<-\frac{9}{7}<0.$$Fromthelastinequality$-\frac{16}{7}\leq-x<-\frac{9}{7}$,adding$\frac{16}{7}$tobothsides,wehave$$0\leq\frac{16}{7}-x<\frac{7}{7}$$or$$0\leqx-\frac{16}{7}<1.$$Combiningthiswith$-\frac{9}{7}<-x<0$,weget$$-\frac{9}{7}<-x\leq0\leqx-\frac{16}{7}<1.$$Therefore$-\frac{9}{7}<-x$and$x-\frac{16}{7}<1$,whichyields$$\frac{9}{7}>x>\frac{16}{7}-1\quad\Rightarrow\quad\frac{9}{7}>x>\frac{9}{7}.$$Theonlypossiblevaluefor$x$thatsatisfiestheconditionis$x=\boxed{\frac{9}{7}}.$

We have $i^5 = i^4\cdot i = 1\cdot (i) = i$.  We also have $i^{-25} = 1/i^{25} = 1/(i^{24}\cdot i) = 1/[1\cdot (i)] = 1/i = \frac1{i}\cdot\frac{i}{i} = i/(-1) = -i$ and $i^{45} = (i^{44})\cdot i= 1\cdot i =i$, and . So, adding these three results gives $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i+-i+i = \boxed{i}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$i^5 = i^4 \cdot i = 1 \cdot i = i$.

Since $i^{24} = 1$, we have $i^{-25} = i^{-24} \cdot i^{-1} = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{i} = -i$.

Similarly, $i^{45} = i^{24} \cdot i^{21} = 1 \cdot i^{-3} = -i$.

Therefore, $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i - i - i = \boxed{-i}$.

Stripped String: 
$i^5=i^4\cdoti=1\cdoti=i$.Since$i^{24}=1$,wehave$i^{-25}=i^{-24}\cdoti^{-1}=1\cdot\frac{1}{i}=-i$.Similarly,$i^{45}=i^{24}\cdoti^{21}=1\cdoti^{-3}=-i$.Therefore,$i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i-i-i=\boxed{-i}$.

a+c&=18\\ \tag{3}
b+d&=21\\ \tag{4}
c+d&=29
\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.

In the first case \begin{align*} \tag{5}
a+d&=19\\ \tag{6}
b+c&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.

In the second case, \begin{align*} \tag{7}
b+c&=19\\ \tag{8}
a+d&=20
\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.

Thus, the only solution is $\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.

First, let's deal with $|x| + 1 > 7$.  Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $|x| > 6$, so the integers that satisfy $|x| + 1 > 7$ are those greater than 6 and those less than $-6$.  Since the inequality is strict ($>$, not $\ge$), $x$ cannot be 6 or $-6$.

Next, we consider $|x+1| \le 7$.  Writing this as $|x-(-1)| \le 7$, we see that $x$ must be within $7$ of $-1$ on the number line, which means it must be one of the integers from $-8$ to 6.  Since the inequality is nonstrict ($\le$, not $<$), $x$ can be $-8$ or 6.

The only integers that satisfy both inequalities are $-8$ and $-7$, and their sum is $\boxed{-15}$.

As the problem suggests, we need to compute the lengths of the diagonals $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$. By the distance formula,

\begin{align*}
AC &= \sqrt{(12 -0)^2 + (-2-7)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 9^2} = 15\\
BD &= \sqrt{(7-1)^2 + (8-0)^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10\\
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\frac 12 \cdot 10 \cdot 15 = \boxed{75}$.

A real number $x$ is in the domain of $g$ if and only if $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0.$$ Expanding this out and simplifying, we get $$10x - 55\ge 0;$$ the smallest solution is $x=\frac{55}{10}=\boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Alternatively, once we have the quadratic equation $$(x-3)^2 - (x-8)^2 \ge 0,$$ instead of expanding it out, we can observe that $(x-3)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $3$ on the number line, while $(x-8)^2$ is the square of the distance from $x$ to $8$. Thus, $(x-3)^2-(x-8)^2\ge 0$ is true if $x$ is closer to $8$ than to $3$, which is true if and only if $x\ge \frac{8+3}{2} = \boxed{\frac{11}{2}}$.

Combining this with the fact that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors gives us that 3 divides $B.$ Since $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1, we have $B=3.$ Now, we have $6A=C^2\cdot 27,$ so $A$ is divisible by 3.

Let $p$ and $q$ be the prime roots. Then, we know that $m = p+q$ and $n = pq$. Since $m < 20$, the primes $p$ and $q$ must both be less than $20$.

The primes less than $20$ are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ $7,$ $11,$ $13,$ $17,$ $19.$ Now we list all possible pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p + q < 20$, remembering to also include the cases in which $p=q$: \[\begin{aligned} & (2,2),(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(2,11),(2,13),(2,17) \\
&(3,3),(3,5),(3,7),(3,11),(3,13) \\
&(5,5),(5,7),(5,11),(5,13) \\
&(7,7),(7,11) \end{aligned}\]There are $7 + 5 + 4 + 2 = 18$ pairs in total. Each pair produces a value for $n$, and furthermore, these values are all distinct, because every positive integer has a unique prime factorization. Therefore, there are $\boxed{18}$ possible values for $n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the sum of the roots is $m$ and the product of the roots is $n$ (by Vieta's Formulas). Since the roots are prime, the only way the product can be prime is if one of the roots is $1.$ It follows that the other root is $m-1,$ so $m-1$ must be prime as well. Thus, $m \in \{3, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19\}.$

Casework:
If $m = 3,$ then the roots must be $1$ and $2,$ and $n = 2.$
If $m = 5,$ then the roots must be $2$ and $3,$ and $n = 6.$
If $m = 11,$ then the roots must be $2$ and $9,$ and $n = 18.$
If $m = 13,$ then the roots must be $2$ and $11,$ and $n = 22.$
If $m = 17,$ then the roots must be $2$ and $15,$ but $15$ is not prime.
If $m = 19,$ then the roots must be $2$ and $17,$ and $n = 34.$
Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values of $n.$

For the roots to be real and rational, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Therefore, $(-7)^2-4 \cdot 1 \cdot c = 49-4c$ must be a perfect square. The only positive perfect squares less than 49 are $1$, $4$, $9$, $16$, $25$, and $36$. The perfect squares that give a integer value of $c$ are $1$, $9$, and $25$.

We want the roots to be of the form $\frac{r\pm\sqrt{r^2-s}}{2}$, where $r$ and $s$ are rational numbers. This requires that $r^2-s$ is a perfect square. Since the quadratic formula gives us $x=\frac{7\pm\sqrt{49-4c}}{2}$, it suffices to find all integers $c$ such that $49-4c$ is a perfect square.

The possible values of $49-4c$ are the odd squares, i.e. $1, 9, 25, 49, \ldots$. Solving for $c$, we get $c=12, 5, 0, -3, \ldots$. The positive values we seek are $\boxed{12,5,0}$.

Denote the two roots of the equation $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We know that $\alpha\beta = 48$, and $\alpha/\beta = 3 \implies \alpha = 3\beta$.

So $ b = -\alpha - \beta = -4\beta$. To maximize $b$, we want to make $\beta$ negative and as large as possible. Given the relationship that $\alpha = 3\beta$ and that $\alpha*\beta = 48$, we see that $\beta = 4$ or $-4$. Clearly $-4$ maximizes $b$, and $b = \boxed{16}$.

If we have two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ on a line, we can find the slope of the line by using the formula $\dfrac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}.$ So, for the line we are given, the slope is $\dfrac{(-5)-(-14)}{2-p}=\dfrac{9}{2-p},$ and the slope is also $\dfrac{(-14)-(-17)}{p-(p+2)}=\dfrac{3}{-2}.$ Setting these values equal, we get $$\dfrac{9}{2-p}=-\dfrac{3}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by the product of the denominators and simplifying gives \begin{align*}
(2-p)(3)&=(-2)(9)\\
6-3p&=-18 \\
p&=8.
\end{align*} Now we need to find $q.$ Using the same strategy as above, we find that \begin{align*}

The common ratio between consecutive terms is $\frac{3}{5}$ (you can choose any two consecutive terms and divide the second one by the first to find the common ratio). So the $n^\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $\frac{125}{9} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5} \right)^{n-1}$. Plugging in $n=8$, we get $$

Let us first define $y=x^{2}$. We can then plug this value into the inequality and add 4 to $-4$, $x^4+4x^2$, and 21, yielding $$0<y^{2}+4y+4<25.$$We can factor $y^2+4y+4$ to obtain $$0<(y+2)^{2}<25.$$Taking the square root gives us $0<|y+2|<5$, which in turn gives us two intervals for solutions of $y$: $-2<y<3$, or $-7<y<-2$.

However, $y$ must be non-negative since $y=x^{2}$, so we have $0\leq y<3$. This means that $-\sqrt{3}< x<\sqrt{3}$ satisfies the original inequality. In interval notation, this is $\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}$.

The common denominator desired is $\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{6}$. So, this expression becomes $\frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}\cdot(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{3})+1\cdot\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}}$. Simplifying this gives $\frac{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{3}+3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}+3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{6}}$. To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{6}$ to get $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{3}\sqrt{6}}{6}$. Simplifying yields ${\frac{9\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{3}}{6}}$, so the desired sum is $9+8+6=\boxed{23}$.

Moving all the terms to the left, we have the equation $x^2-14x+y^2-48y=0$. Completing the square on the quadratic in $x$, we add $(14/2)^2=49$ to both sides. Completing the square on the quadratic in $y$, we add $(48/2)^2=576$ to both sides. We have the equation  \[(x^2-14x+49)+(y^2-48y+576)=625 \Rightarrow (x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625\] Rearranging, we have $(y-24)^2=625-(x-7)^2$. Taking the square root and solving for $y$, we get $y=\pm \sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}+24$. Since $\sqrt{625-(x-7)^2}$ is always nonnegative, the maximum value of $y$ is achieved when we use a positive sign in front of the square root. Now, we want the largest possible value of the square root. In other words, we want to maximize $625-(x-7)^2$. Since $(x-7)^2$ is always nonnegative, $625-(x-7)^2$ is maximized when $(x-7)^2=0$ or when $x=7$. At this point, $625-(x-7)^2=625$ and $y=\sqrt{625}+24=49$. Thus, the maximum $y$ value is $\boxed{49}$.

Similar to the solution above, we can complete the square to get the equation $(x-7)^2+(y-24)^2=625$. This equation describes a circle with center at $(7,24)$ and radius $\sqrt{625}=25$.

The store's revenue is given by: number of books sold $\times$ price of each book, or $p(128-4p)=128p-4p^2$. We want to maximize this expression by completing the square. We can factor out a $-4$ to get $-4(p^2-32p)$.

To complete the square, we add $(32/2)^2=256$ inside the parentheses and subtract $-4\cdot256=-1024$ outside. We are left with the expression
\[-4(p^2-32p+256)+1024=-4(p-16)^2+1024.\]Note that the $-4(p-16)^2$ term will always be nonpositive since the perfect square is always nonnegative. Thus, the revenue is maximized when $-4(p-16)^2$ equals 0, which is when $p=16$. Thus, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book.

Alternatively, since the roots of $p(128-4p)$ are 0 and 32, symmetry tells us that the extreme value will be at $p=16$.  Since the coefficient on $p^2$ is negative, this is a maximum.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that revenue is equal to price times quantity sold. So if the price is $p$ and the quantity sold is $128-4p$, then the revenue is $p(128-4p) = -4p^2 + 128p$. To maximize revenue, we need to find the value of $p$ that maximizes this quadratic function.

The maximum value of a quadratic function occurs at the vertex, which is located at $p = -\frac{b}{2a}$ for the function $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. In this case, $a = -4$ and $b = 128$, so the price that maximizes revenue is $-\frac{128}{2(-4)} = 16$. Since $p \le 32$, the store should charge $\boxed{16}$ dollars for the book to maximize revenue.

Letting $t$ equal the number of tickets sold in a single order, we get the following inequality: \begin{align*} 4200&<(70-(t-60))(t)

\\4200&<130t-t^2

\\\Rightarrow\qquad (t-60)(t-70)&<0
\end{align*}Since the two roots of the left-hand side are 60 and 70, the inequality must change sign at these two points. For $t<60$, both factors of the inequality are negative, thus making it positive. For $60<t<70$, only $t-70$ is negative, so the inequality is negative. Finally, for $t>70$, both factors are positive, making the inequality positive once again. This tells us that the range of $t$ that will result in a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $(60,70)$. Since the number of tickets purchased in one order must be an integer, the largest number of tickets which brings a profit greater than $\$4200$ is $t=\boxed{69}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $n$ be the number of tickets above 60 that were bought. Thus, out of the $60+n$ tickets, 60 of them are at $\$70$ per ticket, and the other $n$ tickets are at $\$70-n$ per ticket. The total cost to buy $60+n$ tickets is:

$$\underbrace{60\text{ tickets}}_{\$70\text{ each}}+\underbrace{n\text{ tickets}}_{\text{\$}70-n\text{ each}}=\$4200+(70-n)n$$

Simplifying the expression above gives:

$$\$4200+70n-n^2$$

This expression represents the revenue made when $60+n$ tickets are sold. To find the largest $n$ such that the amusement park makes a profit greater than $\$4200$, we need to solve the inequality:

$$\big[\text{Revenue}\big]-\big[\text{Cost}\big]>\$4200$$

$$(70-n)n-\$4200>\$4200$$

$$n^2-70n+8400<0$$

Solution: We convert everything to powers of 2 first: $\sqrt8=2^{\frac32}$ and $64\sqrt{8}=2^6\cdot 2^{\frac32}=2^{\frac{15}{2}}$. Thus,   \[\log_{\sqrt8}(64\sqrt{8})=\log_{2^{\frac32}}(2^{\frac{15}{2}})=\frac{\frac{15}{2}}{\frac32}=\boxed{7}\]

The domain of $k(y)$ is all real numbers except for those values that would make the denominator equal to zero, since division by zero is undefined. Thus, we must solve the equation $2y+1=0$ to find the excluded value(s): $$ 2y+1=0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y=-\frac{1}{2}. $$ Therefore, the domain of $k(y)$ in interval notation is $$ \boxed{(-\infty,-1/2)\cup (-1/2,\infty)}. $$

First we find the solution set that results in the equation having no real solutions. We begin by rearranging the equation $x(x+5) = -n$ to $x^2 + 5x + n = 0$. If the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then there are no real solutions. Thus, we want to solve for $n$ in the inequality $25 - 4n < 0$. Adding $4n$ and dividing by 4, we find $n>6.25$. The probability that I chose one of the numbers 7, 8, 9, or 10 is $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

GPT File: drive-download-20230418T045410Z-001/persona_short_explanation_answers/1125_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We first note that $x(x+5) \geq 0$ for all values of $x$. Therefore, for there to be no real solutions to $x(x+5) = -n$, we need $-n < 0$, which implies that $n$ must be positive. This leaves six values for $n$: $1,2,3,4,5,$ and $6$. We can proceed to check each of these cases individually.

If $n=1$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -1$. Note that $x(x+5)$ is always nonnegative, so there are no solutions in this case.

If $n=2$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -2$. Expanding the left-hand side gives $x^2 + 5x + 2 = 0$, and using the quadratic formula yields $$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{17}}{2},$$which yields two real roots. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

If $n=3$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -3$. By similar algebraic manipulations as in the previous case, we obtain $$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{29}}{2},$$which again yields two real roots. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

If $n=4$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -4$. We obtain the quadratic $x^2 + 5x + 4 = 0$, which has roots $$x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.$$We see that only one of these roots is negative, namely $x = \frac{-5 - \sqrt{5}}{2}$, so there is exactly $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$ probability that there are no solutions in this case.

If $n=5$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -5$. We obtain the quadratic $x^2 + 5x + 5 = 0$, which has no real roots. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

If $n=6$, then we have the equation $x(x+5) = -6$. Expanding and solving the resulting quadratic gives two real roots, so there are no solutions in this case. 

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.
