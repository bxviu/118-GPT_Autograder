Extracting Answer from: 
To find the mean of these six test scores, you need to add up all the points and divide by the number of tests.

70 + 80 + 90 + 75 + 80 + 85 = 480

There are six tests, so you divide the sum of the points by 6:

480 / 6 = 80

Therefore, the mean of these six test scores is 80.

Extracting Answer from: 
The triangle is a $30-60-90$ triangle, so the ratio of the sides is $1:\sqrt{3}:2$. 

The length of the shorter leg is 8, which means the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is $2\cdot 8 = 16$. 

Therefore, the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}\cdot 8 = 8\sqrt{3}$. 

Thus, $x = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.

Answer from Original: 16

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/prealgebra/answers/1176_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by using variables to represent the number of each type of player on the team:

- Let r be the number of right-handed boys.
- Let l be the number of left-handed boys.
- Let 2l be the number of left-handed girls.

We know that there are 36 people on the team, so:

r + l + 2l = 36

Simplifying this equation, we get:

r + 3l = 36

We also know that there are four times as many right-handed boys as left-handed boys, so:

r = 4l

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

4l + 3l = 36

7l = 36

l = 5.14

Since we can't have a fraction of a player, we'll round this down to 5 and use it to find the values of r and 2l:

r = 4l = 4(5) = 20
2l = 2(5) = 10

Finally, we're told that half of the girls on the team are left-handed, so there are 20 boys and 16 girls on the team (10 left-handed girls and 6 right-handed girls). Therefore, the number of right-handed boys on the team is 20.

Let $d$ represent the number of days of practice. The number of miles run by each girl can be expressed as $3+6(d-1)$ and the number of miles run by each boy is $5d$. The girls will have outrun the boys after $d$ days if $3+6(d-1)>5d$. We solve this inequality as follows: \begin{align*}
3+6(d-1) &> 5d \quad \implies \\
3+6d-6 &> 5d \quad \implies \\
6d-5d &> 6-3 \quad \implies \\

Extracting Answer from: 
The girls' team runs 3 + 6x miles after x days of practice. The boys' team runs 5x miles after x days of practice. We need to find the value of x that makes the girls' total mileage greater than the boys' total mileage. 

3 + 6x > 5x

Simplifying the inequality:

3 > -x

x > -3

Since x must be a positive integer, we take the smallest integer greater than -3, which is 1.

The smallest number of marbles that can be broken up into bags of $18$ or bags of $42$ must be the least common multiple of both $18$ and $42$.  Factoring, $18 = 2\cdot 3^2$ and $42 = 2\cdot 3\cdot 7$.  The prime factorization of the least common multiple must include $2$, $3^2$, and $7$, and no other primes.  Thus, the answer is $2\cdot 3^2 \cdot 7 = \boxed{126}$.

We want to find the least common multiple of $18$ and $42.$ We start by writing the prime factorizations: \begin{align*}
18 &= 2 \cdot 3^2\\
42 &= 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7
\end{align*} The LCM is $(2)(3^2)(7) = \boxed{126}$, since it must contain all the primes that appear in the prime factorization of either $18$ or $42$, raised to their maximum power in either factorization.

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $\angle CAB=30^\circ$ and since the exterior angle at $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, \[\angle ABC=180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ.\]Angle $x$ and $\angle{BCA}$ are vertical angles and their measures are therefore equal. So, it suffices to find the measure of $\angle{BCA}$.

The angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, so  \[\angle BCA=180^\circ-30^\circ-90^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
The angle measures shown in the diagram add up to $180^\circ$, since they are the angles of a quadrilateral.  Therefore, we must have $$x+30^\circ+90^\circ+(180^\circ - (90^\circ + x))=180^\circ.$$ Simplifying gives $$x+120^\circ=180^\circ.$$ Subtracting $120^\circ$ from both sides gives $x=\boxed{60}$ degrees.

Answer from Original: 36

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/prealgebra/answers/1203_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the original price of the shirt "x". We know that the sale price is 60% off, which means it is 100% - 60% = 40% of the original price. We can set up an equation:

40% of x = $14.40

To solve for x, we can start by converting 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100:

0.4x = $14.40

Then we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.4:

x = $36.00

Therefore, the original price of the shirt was $\$36.00$.

We begin by solving $\frac{1}{4}<\frac{x}{7}$. Multiplying both sides by 7 gives $\frac{7}{4}<x$. We now solve $\frac{x}{7}<\frac{1}{3}$. Multiplying both sides by 7 gives $x<\frac{7}{3}$. Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are $\frac74$ (which we discard) and all values of $x$ strictly between $\frac74$ and $\frac73$. Since $\frac74<\frac{7}{3}$, there is exactly $\boxed{1}$ integer that satisfies the inequality, namely $x=2$.

The only leftover dark gray pieces are the four $1\,\mathrm{in}\times 2\,\mathrm{in}$ pieces in the corners.

Setting this last expression equal to $100$ and expanding gives $(x+2)(y+2)-xy = 100 \Rightarrow xy + 2x+2y+4 = 100 \Rightarrow xy+2x+2y = 96$. Factoring the left side gives $(x+2)(y+2)=96$.

Each school has 4 players, so there are 12 players in total. Each player plays 3 games against each player from each of the other 2 schools, which gives a total of 3 x 2 x 4 x 4 = 96 games. Each player also plays 3 games against the other 3 players from his or her own school, which gives a total of 3 x 4 x (4 - 1) / 2 x 3 = 54 games. So the total number of games played is 96 + 54 = 150. Therefore, there are 150 games of chess played.

The number 1 to any power is always 1, so no matter how many times Hypatia and Euclid cube their numbers, they will both always have the number 1. Thus, Hypatia and Euclid both write down the number 1.


Now, lets take a look at Pythagoras. He keeps cubing his result 20 times starting with the number 2. The numbers he has are \begin{align*}
2^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}8 \\
8^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}512 \\
512^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}134217728 \\
\vdots
\end{align*}We can see that these numbers get out of hand pretty quickly (no wonder it took them so long), so instead, we look at the sum of the results because that is what we are trying to find. Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$. Because the number Ptolemy chose is the negation of what Pythagoras chose, after a certain number of cubes, whatever Pythagoras has, Ptolemy will have the opposite of that. Thus, whatever gigantic number Pythagoras has at the end of the game, Ptolemy will have the negation of that number, and they will add to zero.

Thus, our desired sum is  \begin{align*}1+1&+(\text{some huge number}) + (-\text{the same huge number})\\
&=1+1+0=\boxed{2}.
\end{align*}

Hypatia cubed 1, which remains 1 after being cubed 20 times. Euclid also chose 1, so the sum is 1+1=2 so far. Pythagoras chose 2, which means he ended up with 2^3^20, while Ptolemy chose -2, which means he ended up with -2^3^20. Now, 2^3=8, and 8^2=64, so 2^3^20 is 64 raised to an even larger power, which is an absolutely enormous number. Similarly, (-2)^3=-8, and (-8)^2=64, so (-2)^3^20 is also a very large number, but negated. However, we only care about the sum of the four numbers, and 1 plus -1 (which is what Ptolemy's number ends up being) is 0, so the final answer is 2+0+Pythagoras's number+Ptolemy's number, which is still a very large number that's not worth writing out.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the average number of points Heidi scored on each of the first $6$ tests. Since the final exam counts as two tests, it is worth $2x$ points. In total, Heidi will earn $6x+2x=8x$ points on the $8$ tests.

We know that Heidi needs to earn $90$ points for the semester, which means she needs to earn $90-2x$ points on the first $6$ tests.

If she earns $99$ points on the final exam, her total for the semester will be $8x+99$ points. Since this needs to average out to $90$ points over the $8$ tests, we can write:

$$\frac{8x+99}{8}=90$$

Multiplying both sides by $8$ gives:

$$8x+99=720$$

Subtracting $99$ from both sides gives:

$$8x=621$$

Dividing both sides by $8$ gives:

$$x=77.625$$

Therefore, Heidi has averaged $\boxed{77.625}$ points on each test prior to the final exam.

Suppose the stock started off at a value of $100$. After Monday it had lost $10\%$ of its value, leaving it with $100-0.10(100)=90$ dollars. On Tuesday, the stock lost $20\%$ of what it was worth at the end of the day Monday. Since it was worth $90$ dollars at the end of the day Monday, it lost $20\%$ of $90$ dollars which is $0.20(90)=18$ dollars. Thus at the end of Tuesday the stock was worth $90-18=72$ dollars.

The overall percent loss in value is equal to the total dollar amount of loss divided by the original value and expressed as a percent. Since the stock started off at $100$ dollars and lost $100-72=28$ dollars, the overall percent loss in value from the beginning of Monday to the end of Tuesday is $$\frac{28}{100}\times 100 = \boxed{28\%}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To create an equation with more than one solution, we want to create a situation where some terms cancel out, leaving us with a statement that doesn't tell us anything useful. One way to do this is to make the boxed number equal to the sum of the coefficients of the $x$ terms on each side of the equation. That is, the boxed number should be \[
4+7-12+1=0.
\] Substituting this into the equation gives \[
4x + 6 + 7x - 9 = 12x - 7 - x + 0,
\] which simplifies to \[
10x -3 = 10x-7.

From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\frac{10}{2} =\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon.

Extracting Answer from: 
A: A convex pentagon has 5 vertices. From each vertex, we can draw a diagonal to any vertex that is not adjacent (i.e. not next to it), for a total of 3 non-adjacent vertices. This gives us 3 diagonals from each vertex. However, we must divide by 2 for each diagonal, since we are counting each diagonal twice (once from each endpoint). So, the total number of diagonals is:

5 vertices × 3 non-adjacent vertices × 1/2 for each diagonal = 15 diagonals

Therefore, there are 15 distinct diagonals that can be drawn in a convex pentagon.

\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, we know that $\angle CAB=90^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle BAC=90^\circ-\angle ACB$. By the Triangle Sum Theorem, we know that $$\angle ABC = 180^\circ -\angle CAB -\angle BAC=90^\circ+\angle ACB-x^\circ.$$Since $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$ are complements, we have $\angle ABC+\angle ACB=90^\circ$. Substituting into our expression for $\angle ABC$, we get  \begin{align*}
\angle ABC &=90^\circ+\angle ACB-x^\circ\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 90^\circ+\angle ACB &=90^\circ+\angle ACB-x^\circ\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x^\circ &=0.
\end{align*}Therefore, $\angle PAB$ is a $0^\circ$ angle, which means that $P$ and $A$ coincide. But then, the triangle collapses to a line, and the angle $\angle ACB$ is no longer defined. Therefore, no value of $M$ and $N$ can work, and the problem has no solution. We can confirm this by trying different values of $M$ and $N$; for example, if $M=0$ and $N=90$, then $\angle ACB=90^\circ$, so that $\angle PAB$ is adjacent to and complementary to a right angle, meaning that it is equal to $0^\circ$.

First, we note that $$x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots + x^{2011} = x(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots + x^{2010} + x^{2011}) = x \cdot \frac{x^{2012} - 1}{x - 1},$$since the sum of an infinite geometric series is $\frac{a}{1-r}$ if the first term is $a$ and the common ratio is $r$ (as long as $|r|<1$).  If $x=-1$, then this becomes $$x^{2012} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.$$Thus, $x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots + x^{2010} + x^{2011} = x \cdot \frac{x^{2012} - 1}{x - 1} = (-1) \cdot \frac{0}{(-1) - 1} = \boxed{0}.$$

We need to find $\frac{15}{8}$ of $\frac{2}{5}.$ Since the word "of" means multiply, we need to find the product of these two fractions, $\frac{15}{8} \cdot \frac{2}{5}.$ This equals $\frac{15 \cdot 2}{8 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}$. Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\frac{3 \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{2}}{\cancel{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cancel{5}} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 2}$. Thus, we find the answer is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$

If Victor eats $\frac{2}{5}$ of his sandwich, that means he has $\frac{3}{5}$ of his sandwich remaining. 

Since Kelsey eats $\frac{15}{8}$ as much as Victor does, we can multiply $\frac{2}{5}$ by $\frac{15}{8}$ to find out what fraction of Kelsey's sandwich she ate: 

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{15}{8} = \frac{6}{8} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$$

Therefore, Kelsey ate $\frac{3}{4}$ of her sandwich.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to use the order of operations, which is PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). First, we have to evaluate any expressions inside parentheses, but there are none here. So we move on to exponents, but there are none here either. Next, we perform the multiplication and division operations in order from left to right. So we have:

$182+3\cdot 7-64\div 2+27\div 3 = 182+21-32+9$

At this point, we have only addition and subtraction left, so we perform those operations in order from left to right. Therefore, we get:

$182+21-32+9 = 180+10 = 190$

Therefore, the simplified expression is $190$.

If we can express this number as a single power of 10, then we can directly find the number of zeroes at the end of the numbers. Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it. We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\left( a^m \right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$. Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \begin{align*}
(10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div \left(10^{15}\right)^4 &= (10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\

&=10^{67} \div 10^{60} \\

First, we simplify a small portion of the question: $\frac{8}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{2^3}{9} \cdot \frac{1^4}{2^4}$.  Multiplying these two and combining numerator and denominator, we get $\frac{1 \cdot 2^3}{9 \cdot 2^4}$, which can be made into two fractions and simplified: $\frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{2^3}{2^4} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{18}$.

The inverse of this fraction is $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{18}} = 18$, and $18-17 = \boxed{1}$.

The area of the rectangle is 8 * 5 = 40, and the area of the triangle is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 3 * 3 = 4.5. Therefore, the total area is 40 + 4.5 = 44.5 square units. The answer is 44.5.

We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\sqrt{6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg, and the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg. Let the length of the shorter leg be $x$. Then the length of the hypotenuse is $2x=2\sqrt{6}$, so $x=\sqrt{6}$. The length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}x=\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{6}=\sqrt{18}=3\sqrt{2}$. The sum of the lengths of the two legs is therefore $x+3\sqrt{2}=\sqrt{6}+3\sqrt{2}=\boxed{3\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{6}}$ centimeters.

Extracting Answer from: 
Dragonfruit costs $x-4$ dollars each, so three dragonfruit will cost $3(x-4) = 3x - 12$ dollars total.

Rambutan costs $2x$ more than dragonfruit, so it costs $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars each. One rambutan will therefore cost $3x-4$ dollars. 

Two starfruit cost five dollars less than one rambutan, so two starfruit cost $(3x-4-5)/2 = (3x-9)/2$ dollars. 

Adding it all up, the total cost to buy one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit is:

$$(3x-4) + 2\left(\frac{3x-9}{2}\right) + 3x - 12$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the conversion factor from fallops to ballops: 

3 ballops = 11 fallops 
1 ballop = 11/3 fallops 

Next, we can use this conversion factor to find the equivalent number of ballops in 110 fallops: 

110 fallops * (1 ballop / (11/3 fallops)) = 30 ballops 

Now we need to find the conversion factor from ballops to wallops: 

6 wallops = 5 ballops 
1 wallop = 5/6 ballops 

Finally, we can use this conversion factor to find the equivalent number of wallops in 30 ballops: 

30 ballops * (1 wallop / (5/6 ballops)) = 36 wallops

We use the order of operations, known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction), to simplify:

$92 - 45 \div (3 \times 5) - 5^2 = 92 - 45 \div 15 - 25$

We divide before we subtract, so:

$92 - 45 \div 15 - 25 = 92 - 3 - 25$

Now we subtract:

$92 - 3 - 25 = 64$

Therefore, $92 - 45 \div (3 \times 5) - 5^2 = \boxed{64}$.

If chocolate cannot be on the bottom, then it can only occupy three positions: second, third, or fourth. 

If chocolate is in the second position, there are 3 options for the bottom scoop, and then 2 options for the third scoop, and 1 option for the top scoop. So there are 3x2x1 = 6 ways to stack the ice cream with chocolate in the second position. 

If chocolate is in the third position, there are 3 options for the bottom scoop, and 2 options for the top scoop, but there is only 1 option for the fourth scoop since it must be the remaining flavor. So there are 3x2x1 = 6 ways to stack the ice cream with chocolate in the third position. 

If chocolate is in the fourth position, there are 3 options for the bottom scoop, and then the remaining three flavors can be stacked in any order on top of the chocolate. So there are 3x3x2x1 = 18 ways to stack the ice cream with chocolate in the fourth position. 

In total, there are 6 + 6 + 18 = 30 ways to stack the ice cream cone.

Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)

Extracting Answer from: 
Let x be your age now.

According to the problem, your brother is 4 times as old as you are, so your brother's age is 4x.

Six years from now, you will be x+6 years old and your brother will be 4x+6 years old. The problem states that six years from now, your brother will be twice as old as you will be:

4x+6=2(x+6)

Solving for x:

4x+6=2x+12
2x=6
x=3

So your age now is x=3. Your brother's age is 4x=4(3)=12. Therefore, your brother is currently 12 years old.

Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$.

We therefore have $5\sqrt{5} = w\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\cdot10=\boxed{50}$.

To solve this problem, we will use the formula:

A = |30h - 11/2 m|

where A is the angle between the hour and minute hands, h is the hour (in this case, 3), m is the minute (in this case, 20), and || denotes absolute value.

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = |30(3) - 11/2 (20)|
A = |90 - 110|
A = |-20|
A = 20

Therefore, the acute angle between the hour and minute hands at 3:20 is 20 degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
The juniors drink 1500 cartons of milk per 5-day week, so they consume 1500/5 = 300 cartons of milk per day.
If the average senior drinks milk at the same rate as the average junior, then each senior drinks 300/450 = 2/3 cartons of milk per day.
Thus, the 600 seniors drink a total of 2/3 x 600 = <<2/3*600=400>>400 cartons of milk each school day. Answer: \boxed{400}.

There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the length of the rectangular section of floor is $36$ inches and its width is $24$ inches. It would take $36 \div 6 = 6$ tiles to cover the length of the floor and $24 \div 6 = 4$ tiles to cover the width, so a total of $6 \times 4 = \boxed{24}$ tiles are needed to cover the whole rectangular section of the floor.

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/prealgebra/answers/634_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
A: We first need to convert the dimensions of the rectangular section of floor to the same unit as the square tiles. Since there are 12 inches in a foot:

- The length of the rectangular section is 3 feet x 12 inches/foot = 36 inches.
- The width of the rectangular section is 2 feet x 12 inches/foot = 24 inches.

Now we can calculate how many square tiles are needed:

- Each square tile has an area of 6 inches x 6 inches = 36 square inches.
- The rectangular section has an area of 36 inches x 24 inches = 864 square inches.
- To cover the rectangular section, we need 864 square inches ÷ 36 square inches/tile = 24 tiles.

Therefore, we need 24 six-inch by six-inch square tiles to cover the rectangular section of floor.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{2}{5} - \frac{5}{12}.\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.

To get this common denominator for the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\frac{48}{120}$.

To get the common denominator for $\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{48}{120} - \frac{50}{120} = \frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \frac{22}{120}.\]Notice that $\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\frac{2\cdot11}{2\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start the problem by adding the fractions of students who ride the bus and have a parent drive them to school: $$\frac{2}{5} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{24}{60} + \frac{25}{60} = \frac{49}{60}.$$ This means that $\frac{49}{60}$ of the students do not walk to school. To find the fraction of students who walk to school, we can subtract $\frac{49}{60}$ from $1$: $$1 - \frac{49}{60} = \frac{60}{60} - \frac{49}{60} = \frac{11}{60}.$$ Therefore, $\frac{11}{60}$ of the students walk to school.

We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\!321/3=\boxed{18,\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).

It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\overline{3}$: \[
10 \cdot .0\overline{3} = .\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow .0\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \div 10 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30}.
\]Next, $.\overline{03}$: \[
99 \cdot .\overline{03} = (100-1) \cdot .\overline{03} = 3.\overline{03} - .\overline{03} = 3\\
\Rightarrow .\overline{03} = \frac{3}{99} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 33} = \frac{1}{33}.
\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3} \div .\overline{03} &= \frac{1}{30} \div \frac{1}{33}= \frac{1}{30} \cdot \frac{33}{1}\\
&= \frac{33}{30} = \frac{3 \cdot 11}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{11}{10}\\

Extracting Answer from: 
We'll convert everything to fractions. Let $x = .0\overline{3}$. Then multiplying both sides of the equation $x = .0\overline{3}$ by~$10$, we have $$10x = 0.\overline{3}.$$Subtracting the equation $x = .0\overline{3}$ from $10x = 0.\overline{3}$, we have $$9x = 0.3.$$Dividing by~$9$, we find $x = 1/30$, so $.0\overline{3} = 1/30$.

Similarly, let $y = .\overline{03}$. Then multiplying both sides of the equation $y = .\overline{03}$ by $100$, we have $$100y = 3.\overline{03}.$$Subtracting the equation $y = .\overline{03}$ from $100y = 3.\overline{03}$, we have $$99y = 3.$$Dividing by $99$, we find $y = 1/33$, so $.\overline{03} = 1/33$.

Thus, the expression becomes \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3}\div.\overline{03} &= \frac{1/30}{1/33} \\
&= \frac{1}{30}\times\frac{33}{1} \\
&= \frac{11}{10} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the class average, we need to first calculate the total number of points earned by all students. 

20 students scored 80, which is a total of 20 x 80 = 1600 points. 

8 students scored 90, which is a total of 8 x 90 = 720 points. 

2 students scored 100, which is a total of 2 x 100 = 200 points. 

Thus, the total number of points earned by all students is 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520. 

To find the class average, we divide the total number of points by the number of students: 

2520 ÷ 30 = 84. 

Therefore, the class average (the mean) on this test is 84.

A: We know that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. For a three-digit number of the form $aaa$, the sum of its digits is $3a$. Thus, we want the smallest digit $a$ such that $3a$ is divisible by 9.

The smallest such digit is $a=3$, since $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, the smallest 3-digit number of the form $aaa$ that is divisible by 9 is $\boxed{333}$.

Remember that $\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \cdot 3$, which equals $\boxed{75}.$

Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we have $$\frac{25}{4} \div \frac{1}{12} = \frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}.$$We can simplify this by canceling a factor of 4 in the numerator and denominator: $$\frac{25}{\cancel{4}} \cdot \frac{12}{1} = \frac{25 \cdot 3}{1} = \boxed{75}.$$

To find the difference in height between the two players, we need to subtract the height of Boykins from the height of Ming. First, we need to convert both heights to inches by multiplying feet by 12 and adding the inches. 

$7'5'' = 7\times 12 + 5 = 89$ inches
$5'5'' = 5\times 12 + 5 = 65$ inches

Thus, Ming was $89 - 65 = 24$ inches taller than Boykins.
