Extracting Answer from: 
If John spins a 20, then Gary's list contains the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Thus, these are the numbers on the second spinner.

If John spins a 1, then Gary's list will be empty because there are no positive factors of 1 besides itself. Thus, the game will be over. This yields a maximum of 1 additional spin.

If John spins a 2, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. Then on John's next spin, we will have the same scenario as above. This yields a maximum of 2 additional spins.

If John spins a 4, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1 and 2. As we have already found above, spinning a 2 yields more additional spins than a 1, so the maximum additional spins in this case is 3 spins.

If John spins a 5, then Gary's list will only contain the number 1. As above, this will yield a maximum of 2 additional spins.

Finally, if John spins a 10, then Gary's list will contain the numbers 1, 2, and 5. Of these numbers, 2 and 5 have the highest maximum number of additional spins, so this case has a maximum of 3 additional spins.

Thus, of all of the possibilities, spinning a 4 or 10 next could result in 3 additional spins, so the maximum total number of spins is $\boxed{4}$. These would be achieved by spinning 20, 10, 2, 1 or 20, 10, 5, 1 or 20, 4, 2, 1.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we list the positive factors of 20 that Gary could choose for John's next spin: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. Suppose Gary chooses 10. Then the positive factors of 10 that John could spin on his next turn are 1, 2, 5. After John's next spin, the spinner would have the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 left. Suppose John spins a 5. Then the spinner would have the numbers 1, 2, 4 left. Suppose John then spins a 4. Then the only number left on the spinner is 1, so the game is over after 4 spins.

Another strategy that could have been used is to repeatedly choose the smallest factor of the current number on the spinner. For a spinner containing only one number, John would obviously make no additional spins. For a spinner containing two numbers, John would make one additional spin. For a spinner containing three numbers, John would make two additional spins, and for a spinner containing four numbers, John would make three additional spins. Therefore, for a spinner containing 20, John can make at most $0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = \boxed{28}$ spins.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $1$ divides every integer, we need only find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers $2$ through $10$.  Their prime factorizations are, respectively, $2, 3, 2^2, 5, 2\cdot 3, 7, 2^3, 3^2, 2\cdot 5$.   In its own prime factorization, the LCM must have each prime that appears in this list, raised to at minimum the highest power that appears in the list for that prime, in order for it to divide all of the integers from $2$ through $10$.  Thus, the prime factorization of the LCM is $2^3\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5\cdot 7$. So the LCM is $8\cdot 9\cdot 5\cdot 7 = \boxed{2520}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1002_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of each of the first ten integers is shown below:

\begin{align*}
1 &= 1^1 \\
2 &= 2^1 \\
3 &= 3^1 \\
4 &= 2^2 \\
5 &= 5^1 \\
6 &= 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \\
7 &= 7^1 \\
8 &= 2^3 \\
9 &= 3^2 \\
10 &= 2^1 \cdot 5^1
\end{align*}

The prime factorization of the least common multiple (LCM) of these integers must include all the prime factors in these factorizations, with exponents equal to the maximum exponent among the factorizations. Thus, the LCM has prime factorization $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1$. Multiplying these primes together, we get the LCM:

$$
LCM = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 7^1 = \boxed{2520}

Extracting Answer from: 
The sum of the angles in a regular heptagon is $180(7-2)=900$ degrees, so each angle in a regular heptagon has measure $\frac{900}{7}$ degrees.  This tells us that $BCD$ is an isosceles triangle with $\angle BCD=\angle BDC=180-2\cdot \frac{900}{7}$.  Therefore, $\angle ACD = \frac{1}{2}\left(180-2\cdot\frac{900}{7}\right)=90-\frac{900}{7\cdot 2}$.

[asy]
for(int i=0; i <=7; ++i) {
draw(dir(360*i/7+90)--dir(360*(i+1)/7+90));
}
pair A = dir(360*3/7+90);
pair F = dir(360*4/7+90);
pair C = A+dir(90)*(F-A);
pair D = C+F-A;
pair B = dir(360*2/7+90);

draw(A--C--D--F);
draw(A--B--C);

label("$A$",A,SW);
label("$B$",B,W);
label("$C$",C,ESE);
label("$D$",F,S);
[/asy]

Since $ABCD$ is a square, we have $\angle ADC=90^\circ$.  Therefore, \begin{align*}
\angle BAC&=\angle DAC - \angle DAB\\
&=\left(\angle ACD+ \angle ADC\right)-\angle BDC\\
&=\left(90-\frac{900}{7\cdot 2}+90\right)-\left(180-2 \cdot \frac{900}{7}\right)\\
&=\boxed{\frac{75}{7}}^\circ.

Therefore, the number of revolutions the fan makes during the fly's travel is $$\frac{19{,}404\pi}{6\pi}\approx3234.$$ Since the fan rotates at 20 revolutions per minute, the fly had been on the fan for $$\frac{3234}{20}=161.7$$ minutes.

For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must be divisible by 4. Therefore, in order for a three-digit number with a units digit of 0 to be divisible by 4, the tens digit must be even. There are $4$ choices for the hundreds digit (since it cannot be $0$ or $4$) and $5$ choices for the tens digit (since it cannot be $0$, $4$, or the same as the hundreds digit). Thus, there are $4\cdot5=20$ possible numbers. Of these, $\frac{1}{4}$ (namely, $400$) are in fact divisible by 4.

The area of the circle inscribed inside the semicircle is $ \pi r^2 \Rightarrow \pi(2^2) = 4 \pi .$ The area of the larger circle (semicircle's area x 2) is $ \pi r^2 \Rightarrow \pi(4^2)= 16 \pi$ (the diameter of the inscribed circle, $4$, is the same as the radius of the semicircle). Thus, the area of the semicircle is $\frac{1}{2}(16 \pi) \Rightarrow 8 \pi .$ The fraction of the semicircle that is unshaded is $\frac{4 \pi}{8 \pi} = \frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the fraction of the semicircle that is shaded is $1 - \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Draw radii from the center of the semicircle to the endpoints of the diameter of the inscribed circle, as shown. Let $O$ be the center of the semicircle, and let $P$ be the point of tangency of the smaller circle with the semicircle. Triangle $OAP$ is a $30$-$60$-$90$ triangle, so $OP=4/3$ and $AP=8/3$. The entire shaded region is a sector of the semicircle with radius $4$ minus the area of the inscribed circle. Since the radius of the inscribed circle is $2$, its area is $4\pi$, so the shaded area is $\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot 4\pi \cdot \dfrac{11\pi - 4\pi}{11\pi} = \boxed{\dfrac{30}{121}}$ times the area of the semicircle.

The fractions at the beginning and end are equivalent to $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}$, so we can write the expression as $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{1}$. Recall that an exponent law states that $n^{a} \cdot n^{b} = n^{a+b}$, so we can write the expression as $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{4}$. Because $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{n} = \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$, we can rewrite this as $\frac{2^{4}}{3^{4}}$. This is $\boxed{\frac{16}{81}}.$

\angle ABD &= 180^\circ - \angle CBD \\

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1033_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the minute hand will be on the 12, and the hour hand will be 2/3 of the way from the 8 to the 9. To see this, note that there are 12 units of time from the 8 to the 9 (since there are 12 hours on the clock), and the hour hand has traveled 8 of those units (since it is somewhere past the 8 and not quite at the 9). Thus, the hour hand has traveled 8/12=2/3 of the way from the 8 to the 9. 

To find the angle between the hands, we consider two scenarios: 

1. The minute hand is ahead of the hour hand. In this case, we subtract the angle formed by the hour hand from the angle formed by the minute hand. 

- The minute hand is at the 12, which is 360 degrees from the 6 (where the hands overlap). 
- The hour hand is 2/3 of the way from the 8 to the 9, which is 2/3 of the way from 240 degrees to 270 degrees. So, the hour hand is at 240 + (2/3)(30) = 260 degrees. 

Thus, the angle between the hands when the minute hand is ahead is 360 - 260 = 100 degrees. 

2. The hour hand is ahead of the minute hand. In this case, we subtract the angle formed by the minute hand from the angle formed by the hour hand. 

- The hour hand is 2/3 of the way from the 8 to the 9, which is 2/3 of the way from 240 degrees to 270 degrees. So, the hour hand is at 240 + (2/3)(30) = 260 degrees. 
- The minute hand is at the 12, plus the fraction of an hour that has passed. Since half an hour is 1/2 of 360 degrees (the full circle), and the minute hand moves 360 degrees in an hour, the minute hand moves 1/2*360 = 180 degrees in half an hour. So, the minute hand is at 180 degrees from the 6. 

Thus, the angle between the hands when the hour hand is ahead is 180 + 260 = 440 degrees. 

Since we want the smaller of the two angles, we take the first case, where the minute hand is ahead, and the smaller angle is 100 degrees. 

Thus, the degree measure of the smaller angle formed by the minute and hour hands is $\boxed{100}$ degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
There were $36$ total pies. We see that the greatest common divisor of $3,4,6,$ and $12$ is $12$. Let $a$ be the number of pies containing chocolate, $b$ be the number of pies containing marshmallows, $c$ be the number of pies containing cayenne, and $d$ be the number of pies containing salted soy nuts. Then we can write:
\begin{align*}
a &= 12x \\
b &= 12y \\
c &= 12z \\
d &= 12w
\end{align*}
where $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$ are non-negative integers. The total number of pies that contained at least one of these ingredients is $a + b + c + d$. By Inclusion-Exclusion, we have:
\begin{align*}
a + b + c + d &= (12x) + (12y) + (12z) + (12w) \\
&\quad - (12x + 12y) - (12x + 12z) - (12x + 12w) \\
&\quad - (12y + 12z) - (12y + 12w) - (12z + 12w) \\
&\quad + (12x + 12y + 12z) + (12x + 12y + 12w) \\
&\quad + (12x + 12z + 12w) + (12y + 12z + 12w) \\
&\quad - (12x + 12y + 12z + 12w)
\end{align*}
Simplifying this expression gives $12(x+y+z+w) - 6(x+y+z+w)$. Therefore, the total number of pies that had none of the four ingredients is $36 - 6(x+y+z+w)$. Since $x$, $y$, $z$, and $w$ are non-negative integers, the minimum value of $x+y+z+w$ is $0+0+0+0=0$, which implies the minimum number of pies with none of the four ingredients is $36 - 6(0) = \boxed{36}$.

Notice that $MBCN$ is a rectangle since it has two pairs of parallel sides and all angles are right angles. Let $AM$ be $x$ and $BM$ be $y$. Then, the dimensions of rectangle $ABCD$ are $x+4$ and $y+5$ since $ABCD$ has the same side lengths as $MBCN$ with additional segments $AD$ and $BC$ that have lengths of $4$ and $5$ respectively. We are given that the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $40$, so we have the equation $(x+4)(y+5)=40$, which simplifies to $xy+5x+4y+20=40$. We can also find the area of $MBCN$ with the equation $xy$. To solve for $xy$, we want to get it in terms of $xy+5x+4y+20$. We can rearrange the equation $(x+4)(y+5)=40$ to get $xy+5x+4y=20$. Then, we can substitute this equation into our first equation as $xy+(xy+5x+4y)-20=xy+5x+4y+20$, which simplifies to $xy=\boxed{6}$.

The area of $A_3$ is the sum of the areas of $A_1$ and $A_2$ plus twice the area of the shaded triangle. Since the shaded triangle is a right triangle with legs of lengths 5 and 7, its area is $$\frac{1}{2}(5)(7) = \frac{35}{2}.$$ Thus, the area of $A_3$ is $$25+49+2\left(\frac{35}{2}\right) = \boxed{99}.$$

First, let's ignore the requirement that the product can't be $6$. Then I can pick the first blue face in $6$ ways, and the second blue face in $5$ ways, making $6\cdot 5 = 30$ choices in all. But we've actually counted each possible result twice, because it makes no difference which of the two blue faces I chose first and which I chose second. So the number of different pairs of faces is really $(6\cdot 5)/2$, or $15$.

Now we exclude the pairs which have a product of $6$. There are two such pairs: $\{1,6\}$ and $\{2,3\}$. That leaves me $\boxed{13}$ pairs of faces I can paint blue.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will use complementary counting. First, notice that if a $6$ is painted, then the other number painted must be $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ or $4,$ giving $4$ possibilities. Similarly, if a $3$ is painted, then the other number must be $2$ for the product to be $6$ and not all the painted faces to be $3$. Thus, there are $5$ numbers that cannot be painted along with $3.$ In all other cases, the pairs must include one even number and one odd number. Since there are $3$ odd and even numbers each, there are $9$ pairs of even and odd numbers. We thus get that there are $36 - 5 - 4 - 9 = \boxed{18}$ ways to paint two faces of the die as desired.

$1001$ is the smallest integer greater than $1000$. It also happens to be a multiple of $11$, since $1001 = 11 \cdot 91$. So $1001$ is the smallest multiple of $11$ greater than $1000$ and thus $x = 1001$.

The greatest multiple of $11$ that is less than $11^2 = 11 \cdot 11$ is  $$11 \cdot (11 - 1) = 11 \cdot 10 = 110$$Thus $y = 110$, and we compute $$x - y = 1001 - 110 = \boxed{891}$$

The shaded area consists of one square and two isosceles right triangles.  The square has side length equal to one-third that of the full square, so it has area $\left(\frac13\right)^2=\frac19$ that of the full square.  Each isosceles right triangle has base $\frac23$ that of the full square and height equal to one-third that of the full square, so each such triangle has area $\frac12\cdot\left(\frac23\right)^2\cdot\frac13=\frac1{27}$ that of the full square.

We can create a total of $3\times 3 = 9$ fractions. To count the number of unique values, we need to simplify each of the fractions. Note that the fraction $\frac{x}{y}$ is equal to $\frac{1}{y/x}$, so we only need to consider the unique values of $y/x$.

If $x=4$, then $y/x$ can be $1$, $2$, or $3$.
If $x=8$, then $y/x$ can be $1$, or $2$.
If $x=12$, then $y/x$ can be $1$.

A Venn diagram is helpful in explaining the solution. Let an oval patch represent the set of students taking French and another oval represent those taking Spanish. In the diagram, observe that the intersection (overlap) of the two oval patches represents the set of students taking both French and Spanish (see region B). We begin by placing 3 xs in region B, representing the students taking both French and Spanish. Region A represents the set taking French alone. Since the totals in regions A and B must be 8, we place 5 xs in region A. Similarly we place 9 xs in region C. D represents the set taking neither French nor Spanish. In the second Venn diagram, each x represents a student. Observe that the total number of xs in regions A, B, and C is 17. Therefore D has $30-17=\boxed{13}$ students.

First, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to find how many students take at least one of the languages:

$8+12-3=17$

This means that 17 students take either French, Spanish, or both. To find how many take neither language, we subtract this from the total number of students:

$30-17=13$

Therefore, 13 students take neither French nor Spanish.

First, we count the numbers with exactly one zero in the hundreds place. There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit (it cannot be 0) and 9 choices for the units digit (it cannot be 0 or the same as the hundreds digit). For the tens digit, there are 10 choices of digit (any digit except 0 can be chosen). Therefore, there are $9\cdot10\cdot9=810$ numbers with exactly one zero in the hundreds place.

Next, we count the numbers with exactly one zero in the tens place. There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit and 9 choices for the units digit, as before. For the tens digit, there is only 1 choice of digit (it must be 0). Therefore, there are $9\cdot1\cdot9=81$ numbers with exactly one zero in the tens place.

Finally, we count the numbers with exactly one zero in the units place. There are 9 choices for the hundreds digit and 9 choices for the tens digit, as before. For the units digit, there is only 1 choice of digit (it must be 0). Therefore, there are $9\cdot9\cdot1=81$ numbers with exactly one zero in the units place.

The total number of numbers with exactly one zero is $810+81+81=\boxed{972}$.

We know that the area of the new square is $(2+x)^2$, which is equal to the area of the original square plus 21 square inches: $2^2 + 21 = 25.$ Therefore, we can write the equation: $$(2+x)^2 = 25.$$Taking the square root of both sides, we get $$2+x= \pm 5.$$However, the negative solution does not make sense in this context, so we take the positive solution which gives $x=3$. Therefore, the length of a side of the new square is $\boxed{3}$ inches.

Let $m$ represent the total number of muffins in the original batch.  Hence, each tray contains $\frac{m}{6}$ muffins and $5$ croissants, for a total of $\frac{m}{6}+5$ baked goods.  We know that this value is at least $20$, hence we have the inequality \[ \frac{m}{6}+5 \ge 20.\]To solve, we first subtract $5$ from both sides of the inequality, yielding $\frac{m}{6} \ge 15$, and then multiply both sides by $6$ to get $m \ge 90.$

Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let L be the number of losses and W be the number of wins for Kyle's team in the original scenario. We can set up the following equation based on the given ratio:

$$\frac{L}{W} = \frac{3}{2}$$

Multiplying both sides by 2W gives:

$$2L = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2W = 3W$$

Dividing both sides by W gives:

$$\frac{2L}{W} = 3$$

So the original ratio of losses to wins is 2:3. 

If the team had won twice as many of its games, it would have won 2W games and lost W games. The new ratio of losses to wins would be:

$$\frac{W}{W} = \frac{1}{1} \text{ to } \frac{W}{2W} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Simplifying the ratio gives 1:2. Therefore, the ratio of losses to wins would be $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Let $h$ be the height of the equilateral triangle. From the 30-60-90 triangle, we have $h = 8 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4\sqrt{3}$.

From the 45-45-90 triangle, we have $\frac{x}{2} = h - 8$, which simplifies to $x = 2h - 16$. Substituting $h = 4\sqrt{3}$, we find that

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the least common multiple of 72 and 96, you can list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one they have in common. However, a more efficient method is to use prime factorization.

First, find the prime factorization of each number:

72 = 2^3 × 3^2
96 = 2^5 × 3^0

Notice that both numbers contain factors of 2 and 3. To find the least common multiple, we need to include the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, that means we need to include 2^5 and 3^2:

LCM = 2^5 × 3^2 = 288

Therefore, the least common multiple of 72 and 96 is 288.

Either both given sides are legs, or the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse.  If both sides are legs, then the area of the triangle is $(12)(20)/2 = 120$ square centimeters.

If the 20 cm side is the hypotenuse, then the ratio of the given leg length to the hypotenuse is $12/20=3/5$, so the triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle and the other leg has length 16 cm.  The triangle then has area $(12)(16)/2 = 96$ square centimeters.

The largest possible area then is $\boxed{120}$ square centimeters.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $a$ and $b$ be the legs of the right triangle with $b$ being the hypotenuse. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have \begin{align*}
a^2+b^2 &= 20^2 \\
a^2+b^2 &= 400
\end{align*} We want to maximize the area of the triangle, which is $\frac{ab}{2}$. Since $a^2+b^2=400$, we have $a^2=400-b^2$. Hence, the area of the triangle is $$\frac{ab}{2}=\frac{1}{2}b\sqrt{400-b^2}.$$ Since $\frac{d}{db}\left(\frac{1}{2}b\sqrt{400-b^2}\right)=\frac{200-2b^2}{\sqrt{400-b^2}}$, the area is maximized for $b=10\sqrt{2}$, which gives an area of $$\frac{1}{2}(10\sqrt{2})(10)=\boxed{50\sqrt{2}}~\text{sq cm}.$$[asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let x be the number of points Hadley must score on the final test. Then, the sum of her scores on all five tests would be 92 + 73 + 79 + 87 + x. We want this sum to be 5 times her desired average of 80, or 400. So we can set up the equation:

92 + 73 + 79 + 87 + x = 400

Simplifying, we get:

331 + x = 400

Subtracting 331 from both sides, we get:

x = 69

Therefore, the minimum number of points Hadley must score on the final test in order to have a mean of 80 points for the five tests is 69.

Since the railroad trestle is a straight path connecting the two cliffs, we know that after the train has traveled $3/4$ of the trestle's length, the train has traveled both $3/4$ the horizontal distance between the two cliffs and the $3/4$ of the vertical distance between the cliffs' heights. The difference between the heights of the two cliffs is $172-112=60$ feet. $3/4$ of that difference is $45$ feet. Since the train started from the higher cliff and was moving toward the lower cliff, it has descended $45$ feet from its original altitude of $172$ feet.

[/asy] Let the trestle be 250 feet long, and let the train be $d$ feet from the higher cliff when the front of the train has traveled $\frac{3}{4}$ of the trestle's length (so the front of the train has traveled $250\cdot\frac{3}{4}=187.5$ feet). At that time, the front of the train is at $172 - \frac{172-112}{250}(187.5) = 172 - 60 = 112$ feet above the bottom of the gorge. Therefore, the height of the train above the bottom of the gorge is $112 + \frac{60}{187.5}(d-187.5)$. We can solve for $d$ by realizing that when the train reaches the other side, it is at a height of $112$ feet above the bottom of the gorge, so $$112 = 112 + \frac{60}{187.5}(d-187.5),$$ which gives $d=\boxed{312.5}$ feet.

Jenny's total score on the four tests is thus $(a+b+c+d)$.  Jenny's average score is thus \begin{align*}
\frac{a+b+c+d}{4} &= \frac{(78+10)+(78-10)+(78+20)+(78+20)}{4}\\
&= \frac{4\times 78+40}{4}=78+10.
\end{align*} Jenny's average score is thus $78+10=88$.  The difference between the two averages is thus $88-78=\boxed{10}$.

By adding the two rays $\overrightarrow{BA}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$ at point $B$, we form a straight angle (an angle measuring 180 degrees). Therefore, $\angle ABD + \angle CBD$ must equal 180 degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to calculate how many handshakes occur between members of opposing teams. Each member of one team shakes hands three times with each member of each of the other two teams, for a total of $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 = 24$ handshakes. Since there are three teams in total, this gives us $24 \cdot 3 = 72$ handshakes between opposing team members.

Next, we need to calculate how many handshakes occur within each team. Each member of a team shakes hands once with each of their three teammates, for a total of $3$ handshakes within their team. Since there are three teams, this gives us $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ handshakes within all the teams.

Finally, we need to add these two totals to get the total number of handshakes: 

$$72 + 9 = \boxed{81}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the original number "x". 

According to the problem, if we multiply x by 5, we get: 

5x 

And if we take 21 and add twice the original number, we get: 

21 + 2x 

The problem tells us that these two expressions are equal, so we can set them equal to each other and solve for x: 

5x = 21 + 2x 

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives: 

3x = 21 

Finally, dividing both sides by 3 gives: 

x = 7 

Therefore, the original number is 7.

First, we check how many of the numbers from $1$ to $109$ are multiples of $3$. We divide $109$ by $3$, and it comes out to be $36$ and a bit. So we know this gives us $36$ times the factor $3$ appears, to begin with.

Now, some numbers are multiples of $3^2=9$, so they have $3$ as a factor twice, and we've only counted them once so far! There are $12$ multiples of $9$ less than $109$, and we need to add one to our exponent for each of these. That gives another $12$ to the exponent.

Some numbers are also multiples of $3^3=27$. (Horrible, isn't it?) We actually have four such numbers: $27$, $54$, $81$, and $108$. We've counted two $3$s for each of them, so now we need to count one more for each, adding another $4$ to the exponent.

One more time. What about $3^4=81$? Yes, we do have a multiple of $81$ among our numbers. So we add one more to the exponent, and at last we've gotten all of them.

Finally, we end up with a total of $36+12+4+1=\boxed{53}$ in the exponent.

We can check each number one by one.

1: 1 is a factor of 34 since $1\cdot34=34$ .

2: 2 is a factor of 34 since $2\cdot17=34$ .

3: 3 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 3 to get 34. ( $34\div3$ gives a quotient of 11 and a  remainder of 1.) There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 3 ( $3\div7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder 3.)

4: 4 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can be multiplied by 4 to get 34.  ($34 \div 4$ gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 2.)  There is also no number that can be multiplied by 7 to get 4.  ($4 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.)

8:  8 is not a factor of 34 since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\div8$ gives a quotient of 4 and a  remainder of 2) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 8 ( $8\div7$ gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder 1).

14: 14 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot2=14$ .

17: 17 is a factor of 34 since $17\cdot2=34$ .

29: 29 is not a factor of 34, since there is no number that can multiply it to get 34 ( $34\div29$ gives a quotient of 1 and a  remainder of 5) and is not a multiple of 7 since there is no number that can multiply 7 to get 29 ( $29\div7$ gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder 1).

56: 56 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot8=56$ .

91: 91 is a multiple of 7 since $7\cdot13=91$ .

If the length of the radius of a circle is multiplied by a factor of $k$, then the area of the circle is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$.  Since the larger circle has area 4 times greater than that of each smaller circle, the length of its radius is 2 times greater.  Therefore, the length of its radius is $2\times 4\text{ inches}=\boxed{8}$ inches.

By the associative property of multiplication, it doesn't help to insert parentheses that specify the order of multiplication. For example, the associative property tells us that $(2\cdot(3\cdot 4))\cdot (5+1)$ is the same as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot (5+1)$. So the only way to get different values is to group +1 with a different number of factors. We get \begin{align*}
2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot (5 + 1) &= 144, \\
2\cdot 3 \cdot (4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 126,\\
2\cdot (3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 1) &= 122, \\
(2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) + 1 \hphantom{)} &= 121.
\end{align*}In total there are $\boxed{4}$ possible values for the expression.

The common factors of 120 and 40 are the factors of their greatest common divisor (GCD). Prime factorizing 40 and 120 results in $40 = 2^3 \cdot 5$ and $120 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5$ so their GCD is $2^3 \cdot 5$. The factors of $2^3 \cdot 5$ are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40 - 8 in total. These are the common factors of 120 and 40. The answer is therefore $\boxed{8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In order for the product to be a two-digit even number, either spinner I must land on 2 and spinner II must land on an even number, or spinner I must land on an even number greater than 2 and spinner II must land on any number. The probability that spinner I lands on 2 is $\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability that spinner II lands on an even number is $\frac{2}{5}$. Therefore, the probability that spinner I lands on 2 and spinner II lands on an even number is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{10}$. 

Now we need to consider the probability that spinner I lands on an even number greater than 2 (either 4 or 5) and spinner II lands on any number. The probability that spinner I lands on 4 or 5 is $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$. The probability that spinner II lands on any number is 1. Therefore, the probability that spinner I lands on an even number greater than 2 and spinner II lands on any number is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{2}$.

We consider prime numbers of the form $4k+1$. First of all, $2$ is not representable. If a prime $p$ can be represented as $a^2+b^2$ with $a>b>0$, then \[(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 +2ab = p +2ab\] implying that $\frac{p-a^2}{2}$ is $b^2$ plus a multiple of $ab$. But $0\leq b^2<abfrom which $k=13$ gives us $p=13\cdot 4 + 1 = 53$. We verify that $53=1^2+7^2$ and that no prime of the form $4k+1$ less than $53$ is a sum of two nonzero squares. Therefore, $\boxed{53}$ is the least such prime.

We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE) to solve this problem. If we add the number of boxes that contain pencils and the number of boxes that contain pens, we get 13 + 9 = 22, which is more than the total number of boxes Roslyn has. This means that we have overcounted the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils.

To correct this, we need to subtract the number of boxes that contain both pens and pencils. Let's call this number x. Then we have:

number of boxes with pencils + number of boxes with pens - number of boxes with both pens and pencils = total number of boxes

13 + 9 - x = 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 2

Therefore, there are two boxes that contain both pens and pencils.

Extracting Answer from: 
The smallest three-digit number is 100, and the largest is 999. So we need to count the number of integers between 100 and 999 (inclusive). To do this, we subtract 99 (the number of integers from 1 to 99) from 999 - 100, and add 1 to include 999. This gives:

$999 - 100 - 99 + 1 = \boxed{900}$

Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$.  Since there are four times as many right-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is $4x$.  Since there are twice as many left-handed girls as left-handed boys, and there are $x$ left-handed boys, there are $2x$ left-handed girls.  We place all of this in a Venn diagram:

label(scale(0.8)*"$2x$",(28,45));
label(scale(0.8)*"$4x$",(63,45));

We also know that half the girls on the team are left-handed.  Since there are $2x$ left-handed girls, there are also $2x$ right-handed girls.

There are a total of  \[36=2x+x+4x+2x=9x\]people on the team, so $x=4$.  We are trying to find the number of right-handed boys.  This number is  \[4x=4\cdot4=\boxed{16}.\]

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1176_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by setting up some equations. Let R be the number of right-handed boys, L be the number of left-handed boys, G be the number of girls, and B be the number of boys (both left- and right-handed).

From the first sentence, we know that R = 4L.

From the second sentence, we know that L = B + 2G (since there are twice as many girls as boys among the left-handers).

From the third sentence, we know that G/2 are left-handed.

Finally, we know that R + L + G = 36 (since there are 36 people on the team).

We can use these equations to solve for R. First, substitute 4L for R in the equation R + L + G = 36 to get:

4L + L + G = 36

Simplify to:

5L + G = 36

Next, substitute B + 2G for L in the above equation to get:

5(B + 2G) + G = 36

Simplify to:

5B + 11G = 36

Finally, substitute R = 4L = 4(B + 2G) into the equation R + L + G = 36 to get:

4(B + 2G) + B + 2G + G = 36

Simplify to:

5B + 9G = 36

Now we have two equations with two variables (5B + 11G = 36 and 5B + 9G = 36). We can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate B:

2G = 0

This tells us that there are no girls on the team, which is obviously not true based on the problem statement. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $ABCD$ is a regular pentagon, we have $\angle BAD = \frac{180(5-2)}{5} = 108^\circ$. Similarly, $\angle BCD = \frac{180(6-2)}{6} = 120^\circ$ since $BCDEFG$ is a regular hexagon. Since $\overline{AD}$ is a common side of both polygons, we know that $\angle BAC = \angle BAD + \angle DAC = \angle BCD + \angle DAB.$ Plugging in our previously found values, we have $\angle BAC = 108^\circ + \angle DAC = 120^\circ + \angle DAB,$ so $\angle DAC - \angle DAB = 12^\circ.$ Since $\angle DAB + \angle BAC + \angle DAC = 180^\circ,$ we have $\angle BAC = \boxed{84^\circ}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $h$ be the number of students who played only hockey, $b$ be the number of students who played only baseball, and $hb$ be the number of students who played both hockey and baseball. 

From the given information, we can set up the following equation: 

$$h + b + hb + 8 = 50$$

We also know that there were $33$ students who played hockey and $24$ students who played baseball. However, we can't simply add these numbers together to get the total number of students who played either hockey, baseball, or both, because some students might have been double-counted (i.e. the students who played both). 

To account for the double-counting, we can use the formula: 

$$\text{Total} = \text{Only\ } A + \text{Only\ } B + \text{Both\ } A\ \text{and\ } B$$

Plugging in the given information: 

$$50 = h + b + hb + 8$$

$$33 = h + hb$$

$$24 = b + hb$$

Solving for $hb$ (the number of students who played both hockey and baseball): 

$$hb = (h + hb) + (b + hb) - 50 = 33 + 24 - 50 = \boxed{7}$$

So $7$ of the students surveyed played both hockey and baseball.

Let $d$ represent the number of days of practice. The number of miles run by each girl can be expressed as $3+6(d-1)$ and the number of miles run by each boy is $5d$. The girls will have outrun the boys after $d$ days if $3+6(d-1)>5d$. We solve this inequality as follows: \begin{align*}
3+6(d-1) &> 5d \quad \implies \\
3+6d-6 &> 5d \quad \implies \\
6d-5d &> 6-3 \quad \implies \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the number of days of practice "d". On the first day, each girl runs 3 miles, so they start with a total of 3 miles. After that, each day they run an additional 6 miles, so by the end of the practice, they will have run a total of:

3 + 6d

Meanwhile, the boys' team runs 5 miles every day, so by the end of practice, they will have run a total of:

5d

In order for the girls' total mileage to surpass the boys', we need to set up an inequality:

3 + 6d > 5d

Simplifying this, we get:

3 > -d

Since we know that d is a positive number (you can't have negative days of practice!), this inequality will always be true. Therefore, the girls' total mileage will always surpass the boys', no matter how many days of practice they have.

So, to answer the question, the girls will have run a total of:

3 + 6d

miles by the time the coach orders new equipment.

Let the original side length of the square be $x$. When we fold it in half to form a rectangle, one side of the rectangle will have length $x$ and the other side will have length $\frac{x}{2}$. Since the perimeter of the rectangle is 18 inches, we have $2(x + \frac{x}{2}) = 18$, which simplifies to $3x = 18$ and $x = 6$. Therefore, the original square has side length 6 inches and area $(6\text{ in})^2 = \boxed{36}$ square inches.

The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b_1=x$ and $b_2=2x$, and $h=x$ since one base is equal to the height. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$$A=\frac{1}{2}(x+2x)x=\frac{1}{2}(3x^2)=\boxed{\frac{3}{2}x^2}$$

Therefore, the area of the trapezoid in terms of $x$ is $\frac{3}{2}x^2$.

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $\angle CAB=30^\circ$ and since the exterior angle at $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, \[\angle ABC=180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ.\]Angle $x$ and $\angle{BCA}$ are vertical angles and their measures are therefore equal. So, it suffices to find the measure of $\angle{BCA}$.

The angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, so  \[\angle BCA=180^\circ-30^\circ-90^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]

The first odd positive integer is 1. To find the 17th odd positive integer, we simply need to add 2 sixteen times to this first odd positive integer: $$1+2+2+2+\cdots+2$$ We can clearly see that we're adding 2 to the previous term 16 times. This can be more succinctly written as $2\cdot16$. Evaluating this expression gives us $32$. Thus, the 17th odd positive integer is $1+2\cdot16 = \boxed{33}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can find the prime factorization of 180 and 450 and then identify the greatest common factor by taking the product of the common prime factors with the lowest exponents.

Prime factorization of 180: $180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$
Prime factorization of 450: $450 = 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$

The common prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. The lowest exponent of 2 is 2 in 180. The lowest exponent of 3 is 2 in both 180 and 450. The lowest exponent of 5 is 1 in 180 and 2 in 450. Therefore, the greatest common factor is $2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^1 = \boxed{180}$.

The perfect squares from 100 and 200 (inclusive) are 100, 121, 144, 169, and 196.  The numbers that are 1 or 2 larger than those perfect squares are as follows:

101, 102, 122, 123, 145, 146, 170, 171, 197, and 198.

Clearly, no even number greater than 2 can be a prime number, so we narrow our field down to 101, 123, 145, 171, and 197.

Testing, we see that 101 is prime, 123 is not (3 times 41), 145 is not (5 times 29), 171 is not (9 times 19), and 197 is prime.  Hence, the sum of the primes that fit the problem is $101+197= \boxed{298}$.

Note that the only possible perfect squares that leave a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3 are 1 and 4, respectively. Therefore, we only need to consider primes that are equal to 1 or 2 more than a perfect square of 1 or 4 modulo 3.

For the perfect square of 1 modulo 3, we have $1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, so the primes we are interested in are those that are equal to 2 or 3 modulo 3. The perfect squares that are congruent to 1 modulo 3 in the range are $1^2$, $4^2$, $7^2$, $10^2$, $13^2$, and $16^2$, corresponding to the primes 101, 109, 127, 151, 173, and 197.

For the perfect square of 4 modulo 3, we have $2^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, so the primes we are interested in are those that are equal to 0 or 1 modulo 3. The perfect squares that are congruent to 2 modulo 3 in the range are $3^2$, $6^2$, $9^2$, $12^2$, and $15^2$, corresponding to the primes 103, 113, 131, 157, and 181.

Therefore, the sum of the primes we are interested in is $101+109+127+151+173+197+103+113+131+157+181=\boxed{1499}$.

The triangle is shown below with segment $\overline{CD}$ drawn perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$: [asy]
import olympiad; size(200); import geometry; import graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));
pair A = origin, B = (10*sqrt(3),10), C = (10*sqrt(3) + 10,0), D = foot(C,A,B);

label("$A$",A,W); label("$B$",B,N); label("$C$",C,E); label("$D$",D,S);
draw(rightanglemark(A,D,C,20));
[/asy] Since $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\angle C = 45^\circ$, then $m\angle B = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$ also. Therefore, $\triangle ABC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, which means $AB = BC$. Also, since $\angle A = 30^\circ$, then $\angle CAD = 60^\circ$, so $\triangle ACD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle. Therefore, $AD = \frac{20}{2} = 10$ and $CD = AD \sqrt{3} = 10\sqrt{3}$. Since $AB = BC = 20$ cm, then $BD = 20 - 10\sqrt{3}$ cm. Finally, by the Pythagorean Theorem applied to right triangle $\triangle BCD$, we get: \begin{align*}
CD^2 + BD^2 &= BC^2\\
(10\sqrt{3})^2 + (20-10\sqrt{3})^2 &= BC^2\\
300 + 400 - 40\sqrt{3} &= BC^2\\
700 - 40\sqrt{3} &= BC^2 \\
\end{align*} Therefore, $BC = \boxed{\sqrt{700 - 40\sqrt{3}}}$ centimeters.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the smaller prime number "x". Then the larger prime number must be "x+17", since the difference between them is 17.

We know that both of these numbers are prime, which means they are only divisible by 1 and themselves. We also know that a prime number greater than 2 must be odd. Therefore, if we add two odd numbers (x and x+17), we will get an even number (since odd + odd = even).

Therefore, to find the sum of these two primes, we simply add them together:

x + (x+17) = 2x + 17

This expression is in simplest form, so we can't simplify it any further. Therefore, the sum of the two primes is 2x + 17. To find the actual value of this expression, we would need to know the value of "x".

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 2:48 the minute hand points at minute 48, which is $\frac35$ of the way from hour 9 to hour 10.  Therefore, the minute hand is $\frac35\cdot 30 = 18^\circ$ past hour 9, which means it is $30^\circ - 18^\circ = 12^\circ$ shy of hour 10.  This means the minute hand is $2\cdot 30^\circ + 12^\circ = 72^\circ$ shy of hour 12.

The hour hand is $\frac{48}{60} = \frac45$ of the way from hour 2 to hour 3, so it is $\frac45\cdot 30^\circ = 24^\circ$ past hour 2.  So, the hour hand is $2\cdot 30^\circ + 24^\circ = 84^\circ$ past hour 12.

Combining the angles between each hand and hour 12, the angle between the hands is $72^\circ + 84^\circ = \boxed{156^\circ}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
At 2:48pm, the hour hand is pointing between the 2 and 3, and the minute hand is pointing at the 8. 

The hour hand represents a fraction of 2/12 or 1/6 of a full circle (360 degrees), since there are 12 hour markers on the clock face. 

The minute hand represents a fraction of 8/60 or 2/15 of a full circle, since there are 60 minute markers on the clock face. 

To find the angle between the hands, we need to find the difference between their angles from the 12 o'clock position. 

The angle formed by the hour hand at 2:48pm is (2/12) x 360 = 60 degrees from the 12 o’clock position. 

The angle formed by the minute hand at 2:48pm is (8/60) x 360 = 48 degrees from the 12 o’clock position. 

The difference between these angles is 60 - 48 = 12 degrees. 

Since this angle is less than 90 degrees, it is not obtuse. 

However, if we consider the angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand after 3:00pm, we can see that it is obtuse. 

At 3:00pm, the hour hand moves to the 3 marker, which is 1/4 of a full circle or 90 degrees from the 12 o'clock position. 

The angle formed by the minute hand at 3:00pm is 0 degrees from the 12 o'clock position, since it is pointing directly at the 12. 

The difference between these angles is 90 - 0 = 90 degrees, which is obtuse. 

Therefore, the number of degrees in the measure of the smaller obtuse angle formed by the hands of a standard clock at 2:48pm is 0 degrees, since there is no obtuse angle at that time.

Each digit to the right of the vertical bar represents (the units digit of) one exam grade. Counting the digits, we see that there are $27$ exam grades in all. Thus, the $14^{\rm th}$ grade in increasing order is the median (since there are $13$ grades smaller than it and $13$ grades larger than it). The chart makes it easy to read off the grades in increasing order -- we just read across the rows, from top to bottom. The $14^{\rm th}$ entry is $78,$ so that's the median grade.

The mode is the most frequently occurring grade. In this case, it's $86,$ which appears four times in the chart.

The arithmetic mean of the median and mode of the data is $\dfrac{1}{2}(78+86),$ or $\boxed{82}.$

Initially, John has $2a$ pins, where $a$ is the number of pins in each pile. He gives away $\frac{a}{6}$ pins, so $2a-\frac{a}{6} = \frac{11a}{6} = 66$ is the number of pins he has left. We get $a=36$, so he originally had $2a = \boxed{72}$ pins.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's work backwards from what we know. We know that John had 66 pins left after giving his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. 

One-third of one pile is equivalent to $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}$ of John's original number of pins, since he gave his brother one-half of that. So after giving his brother $\frac{1}{6}$ of his original number of pins, John had $-\frac{1}{6}$ of his original number of pins remaining (he had 66 pins left, which is $-\frac{1}{6}$ of the original number of pins). 

To find the original number of pins, we can set up an equation: 

$$-\frac{1}{6}x = -66$$ 

where $x$ is the original number of pins. Solving for $x$, we get: 

\begin{align*}
-\frac{1}{6}x &= -66 \\
x &= (-66) \cdot (-6) \\
x &= 396
\end{align*}

Therefore, John originally had 396 hat pins.

Because the integers are between 200 and 300, we know that the hundreds digit is a 2. Thus, we are looking for two digits that sum to $15 - 2 = 13$. There are three such pairs of digits: 6 and 7, 5 and 8, and 4 and 9. Each pair yields two possibilities for creating a three-digit integer, since the order matters. Thus, there are $3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{6}$ such integers.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1239_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We need to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $a+b+c = 15$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits between 0 and 9 inclusive.

Let's use a "stars and bars" approach to count the solutions. We can think of the 15 as a string of 15 stars, like this:

$$\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star\star$$

If we want to split up these stars into three groups to represent the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$, we can use two bars to separate them, like this:

$$\star\star|\star\star\star\star\star|\star\star\star\star\star\star$$

Now, the number of stars on the left represents the value of $a$, the number of stars in the middle represents the value of $b$, and the number of stars on the right represents the value of $c$. 

We have 15 stars and 2 bars, which means there are 17 objects in total. We need to choose 2 of them to be bars and the rest to be stars, which we can do in $\binom{17}{2}$ ways. 

However, we can't use 0 as a digit, so we need to subtract the number of solutions where one of the digits is 0. There are three ways this can happen: 

- $a=0$ with 14 stars (impossible for $b$ and $c$ to both be positive)
- $b=0$ with 15 stars (impossible for $a$ and $c$ to both be positive)
- $c=0$ with 15 stars (impossible for $a$ and $b$ to both be positive)

Each of these cases gives us $\binom{16}{1}$ solutions (since we only have 16 objects to choose from instead of 17), so we need to subtract $3\binom{16}{1}$ from our count.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is:

$$\binom{17}{2} - 3\binom{16}{1} = 136$$

So there are $\boxed{136}$ integers between 200 and 300 with digits summing to 15.

Extracting Answer from: 
The inner light gray rectangle is bounded by two strips of wood, each of which is 1 inch wide. Therefore, if the length and width of the inner rectangle are $l$ and $w$ respectively, then the length and width of the outer dark gray rectangle are $l+2$ and $w+2$, respectively. We are given that $lw = 100$, and need to find $(l+2)(w+2)$. We have: \begin{align*}
(l+2)(w+2) &= lw + 2(l+w) + 4\\
&= 100 + 2(l+w) + 4.
\end{align*} The perimeter of the inner light gray rectangle is $2l + 2w$, so the perimeter of the outer dark gray rectangle is $2(l+2+w+2) = 2(l + w + 4)$. Therefore $l + w = \frac12\cdot 2(l+w+4) - 4 = \frac12\cdot 2(l+w) + 4$, so $2(l+w) = l+w+8$. Substituting into our expression for $(l+2)(w+2)$, we have $$(l+2)(w+2) = 100 + l + w + 4 + 4 = 108 + l + w.$$ Since $l+w = (l+w+8) - 8 = 2(l+w) - 8$, we have $l+w = 8 + \frac12(l+w)$, so $\frac{1}{2}(l+w) = 4$, which means $l+w=8$. Therefore $$(l+2)(w+2) = 108 + 8 = \boxed{116}.$$

We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. The principle states that:

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

where |A| represents the number of elements in set A, and A ∪ B represents the union of sets A and B. Essentially, we are adding the sizes of sets A and B, but we need to subtract the size of their intersection to avoid overcounting.

Using this principle, we know that:

|Math ∪ Science| = 28 + 21 - |Math ∩ Science|

where Math represents the set of students participating in MATHCOUNTS, and Science represents the set of students participating in science club.

We also know that:

|Math ∪ Science| + |Neither| = 50

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:

28 + 21 - |Math ∩ Science| + 6 = 50

|Math ∩ Science| = 5

The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the angle measures in a polygon with 7 sides sum to $180(7-2) = 900$ degrees, which means that the desired polygon has more than 7 sides.  Meanwhile, the angle measures in a polygon with 8 sides sum to $180(8-2) = 1080$ degrees.  So, it's possible that the polygon has $\boxed{8}$ sides, and that the last angle measures $10^\circ$.

To see that this is the only possibility, note that the angle measures in a polygon with 9 sides sum to $180(9-2) = 1260$ degrees.  Therefore, if the polygon has more than 8 sides, then the last interior angle must measure at least $1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ$.  But this is impossible because each interior angle of a convex polygon has measure less than $180^\circ$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ.$ Let $x$ be the missing angle in our polygon. Then we know that the sum of the other $n-1$ angles is $1070^\circ + x.$

So, the sum of all the angles of the polygon is $(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ + x = 180^\circ \cdot (n-2+x/180).$ Since the polygon is convex, each of its angles is less than $180^\circ.$ Therefore, we have the inequality $n-2+\frac{x}{180} < n,$ which simplifies to $x < 180^\circ.$

Now we see that $1070^\circ + x$ is also the sum of all but one of the angles of a polygon, and hence $1070^\circ + x < (n-1) \cdot 180^\circ = n \cdot 180^\circ - 180^\circ.$ Solving for $x$ using these two inequalities, we get \[
x < 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad x < 10n-125.
\]Since $x$ must be an integer multiple of $5^\circ,$ we conclude that $x \le 175^\circ.$ Furthermore, $x$ must be a multiple of $5^\circ$ between $5^\circ$ and $175^\circ,$ so $x$ can have the values $5^\circ,10^\circ,\ldots,175^\circ.$

We substitute these values one by one to see which ones work. If $x=5^\circ,$ then we want $1075^\circ$ to be the sum of all but one of the angles of a polygon. However, $1075^\circ$ is not one less than a multiple of $180^\circ,$ which is impossible. For $x=10^\circ,$ we want $1080^\circ$ to be one less than a multiple of $180^\circ.$ We can check that $n=7$ is the only solution. If $x=15^\circ,$ then $1085^\circ$ should be one less than a multiple of $180^\circ.$ We check each possible value of $n$ and see that none of them work. Continuing in this manner, we can quickly check and find that $n=7$ is the only solution. Therefore, the polygon has $\boxed{7}$ sides.

Jim walks a distance equal to the diagonal of the rectangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:

$300^2 + 400^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the diagonal

Simplifying:

$c^2 = 250000$

$c = \sqrt{250000} = 500$

So Jim walks 500 feet.

Martha walks the length and width of the rectangle, for a total distance of:

$2(300) + 2(400) = 1000$

So Martha walks 1000 feet.

Therefore, Jim walks $1000-500=\boxed{500}$ feet less than Martha.

We begin by finding the prime factorization of 3105. We can first find that 5 is a factor of 3105 since its last digit is 5. We can then find the sum of the digits of 3105, which is $3+1+0+5=9$, so 3 is also a factor of 3105. Dividing by 5 and 3 successively, we get $3105=5\cdot 3\cdot 207$. We can continue dividing 207, but we notice that it is only divisible by odd numbers, and we have already found all the odd prime factors of 3105. Therefore, the greatest prime factor of 3105 is $\boxed{5}$.

We have  \[

\] and we are asked to convert a quantity whose units are furlongs per fortnight to miles per day.  We divide the first equation by 14 days to obtain a quantity which is equal to 1 and has units of fortnight in the numerator. \[
1=\frac{1\text{ fortnight}}{14\text{ days}}.
\] Similarly, \[
1=\frac{1\text{ mile}}{8\text{ furlongs}}.

First, we need to convert the distance traveled from furlongs to miles. Since there are 8 furlongs in a mile, we can divide 2800 by 8 to get:

2800 ÷ 8 = 350

So the distance traveled was 350 miles in a fortnight (2 weeks). To find the average number of miles per day, we can divide this by the number of days in a fortnight:

350 ÷ 14 = 25

Therefore, the British cavalry averaged 25 miles per day.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the two-digit number be $10a+b$, where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits, respectively. Since one digit is three times the other, we have two cases: $a=3b$ or $b=3a$. Note that $b$ cannot be greater than $3a$, or else $10a+b$ would be a three-digit integer. Similarly, $a$ cannot be greater than $3b$, or else $10a+b$ would be a three-digit integer. Therefore, $b\leq 3a$ and $a\leq 3b$, which give us the inequalities $a\leq 3b/3= b$ and $b\leq 3a/3= a$. These inequalities imply that $a=b$, so the only two-digit integers that work are $30, 33, 60, 66, 90, 93$. Their sum is $30+33+60+66+90+93=\boxed{372}$.

Anna's meals are each $\frac{7}{20}$ peaches. Converting this into a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 5. Doing so, we get \[\frac{7}{20} \cdot \frac{5}{5} = \frac{7 \cdot 5}{20 \cdot 5} = \frac{35}{100} = 0.35\]Because 0.35 < 0.36, $\boxed{\text{Dana}}$ has larger meals.

Extracting Answer from: 
Anna has 7 peaches divided into 20 meals, so each meal has $\frac{7}{20} = 0.35$ peaches. 

Dana has 9 peaches divided into meals of 0.36 peaches each. To find how many meals he has, we divide 9 by 0.36: 

$\frac{9}{0.36} = 25$ 

So Dana has 25 meals. 

Since Anna's meals have 0.35 peaches and Dana's meals have 0.36 peaches, Dana's meals are larger.

The denominators $5$ and $3$ have a common multiple of $15$.  We use this to write $\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{3}{3}=\frac{3}{15}$ and $\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{5}{5}=\frac{10}{15}$.  Then, we can add the fractions by adding the numerators and keeping the denominator.  We have $$\frac{1}{5}+\frac{2}{3}=\frac{3}{15}+\frac{10}{15}=\frac{3+10}{15}=\boxed{\frac{13}{15}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The fraction of the pie that Louis eats is $\frac{1}{5}$, and the fraction of the pie that Jack eats is $\frac{2}{3}$. To find the total amount they eat, we need to add these two fractions together, but we need a common denominator first. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15, so we can rewrite these fractions with a denominator of 15:

$$\frac{1}{5}=\frac{3}{15}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\frac{2}{3}=\frac{10}{15}$$

Now we can add the two fractions:

$$\frac{3}{15}+\frac{10}{15}=\frac{13}{15}$$

So Louis and Jack eat $\boxed{\frac{13}{15}}$ of the pie altogether.

Since $AP = BP$, right triangle $APB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $AB = AP\sqrt{2} = 4\sqrt{2}$ and $\angle ABP = 45^\circ$, so $\angle DBC = 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ$, which means $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle as well.  Since $P$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$, we have $BD = 2BP = 8$ and $PD = BP = 4$.  Since $DBC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, we have $CD = BD = 8$ and $BC =CD\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$.  Finally, the perimeter of $ABCDP$ is \[AB+BC+CD+DP + AP = 4\sqrt{2}+8\sqrt{2}+8+4+4 = \boxed{16+12\sqrt{2}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Denote the intersection of $\overline{AP}$ and $\overline{BC}$ by $E$. Since $\overline{AP} \perp \overline{BD}$ and $\overline{AB} \perp \overline{BC}$, then quadrilateral $ABEP$ is a rectangle, so $BE = AP = 4$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BDC$, $$\sqrt{BC^2 - BE^2} = DC = \sqrt{BC^2 - 16}.$$By the Distance Formula and Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $EBC$, $$EC = \sqrt{BE^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{16 + BC^2}.$$Since $\overline{BD} \perp \overline{DC}$, then $\angle PDC = 90^\circ$, so $$PD = \sqrt{DC^2 - PC^2} = \sqrt{(BC^2 - 16) - 4^2} = \sqrt{BC^2 - 32}.$$Hence, the perimeter of pentagon $ABCDP$ is $$AP + PB + BC + CD + PD = 4 + 4 + \sqrt{16 + BC^2} + \sqrt{BC^2 - 16} + \sqrt{BC^2 - 32}.$$To eliminate the radicals in the expression, we square both sides of $\sqrt{BC^2 - BE^2} = \sqrt{BC^2 - 16}$ and $\sqrt{BE^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{16 + BC^2}$ to get $$BC^2 - BE^2 = BC^2 - 16 \implies BE^2 = 16$$ and $$BE^2 + BC^2 = 16 + BC^2 \implies BE^2 = 16,$$ so $BE = 4$. Substituting, the perimeter is $$4 + 4 + \sqrt{BC^2 + 16} + BC + \sqrt{BC^2 - 32}.$$To eliminate the remaining radicals in the expression, we square both sides of $\sqrt{BC^2 + 16}$ to get $$BC^2 + 16 = (BC + 4)^2 = BC^2 + 8BC + 16 \implies BC = \frac{1}{2}.$$Thus, the perimeter is $$4 + 4 + \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^2 + 16} + \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^2 - 32} = \boxed{\frac{27}{2}}.$$

The positive multiples of $17$ that are less than $50$ are $17$ and $34$. There are not any more since $17 \cdot 3 = 51$, and $51$ is not less than $50$. Then we know that the negative multiples of $17$ that are greater than $-50$ are $-17$ and $-34$. We still have to think about whether $0$ is a multiple of $17$ or not, and it is since $0 = 0 \cdot 17$ (or because of the more general rule that $0$ is a multiple of every integer).

So there are $\boxed{5}$ multiples of $17$ that are greater than $-50$ and less than $50$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Writing out the prime factors of $22$ and $48$, we see that $22 = 2 \cdot 11$ and $48 = 16 \cdot 3 = 2^4 \cdot 3$. Since $11$ does not divide $48$ and $3$ does not divide $22$, it follows that the greatest common factor of $22$ and $48$ is $2$.

The least common multiple, on the other hand, must account for the prime factors of both $22$ and $48$. The highest power of $2$ present in either term is $2^4 = 16$, of $3$ is $3^1 = 3$, and of $11$ is $11^1 = 11$. Thus, the LCM will be $2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 11 = 528$. The product of the greatest common factor and the least common multiple is thus $2 \cdot 528 = \boxed{1056}$.

The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2)=540$ degrees, so we have the equation $$2x+3y=540.$$ We also know that $y=x+y$, since each of the large angles is equal to the sum of the two acute angles. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$, we get $y=2x$, so substituting into the first equation gives $$2x+3(2x)=540.$$ Simplifying gives $8x=540$, so $x=67.5$ degrees. Therefore, each of the large angles is equal to $2x=2(67.5)=\boxed{135}$ degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus.  We know that one diagonal is 10 units, so $d_1 = 10$.  We also know that the area of the rhombus is 120 square units, so \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{2}d_1d_2 &= 120\text{ square units}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{1}{2}(10)d_2 &= 120\text{ square units}\\
\Rightarrow\qquad d_2 &= 24\text{ units}.
\end{align*}

Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, this means that the other diagonal also has length 24.  Let $s$ be the length of a side of the rhombus.  The area of the rhombus can be expressed in two ways: \[\frac{1}{2} d_1d_2= 120\text{ square units}\quad \text{\textbf{and}}\quad A = rs\]where $r$ is the inradius of the rhombus (the radius of its inscribed circle).  

We can solve for $r$ in the second equation: \begin{align*}
120 &= rs\\
\Rightarrow\qquad \frac{120}{s} &= r.
\end{align*}We also know that the altitude of the rhombus with respect to a side has length $r$, and the altitude with respect to a side has length $s/2$ since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.  Thus, we have the equation: \[r^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = d_1^2/4.\]Substituting our known values, we get: \[\left(\frac{120}{s}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 5^2.\]Multiplying everything out gives \[144s^4 - 1200s^2 + 625 = 0.\]Dividing everything by $16$ gives \[9s^4 - 75s^2 + \frac{625}{16} = 0.\]We can simplify this further by substituting $t = s^2$, giving \[9t^2 - 75t + \frac{625}{16} = 0.\]This quadratic factorizes as $(t-25/4)(9t-25) = 0$, so $t=s^2 = 25/9$ or $s^2 = 25/4$.  Since $s$ is a length, we choose $s^2 = 25/4$.  Thus $s = 5/2$ and the perimeter of the rhombus is $4s = \boxed{10}$ units.

You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $42!$. Since $10=2\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.

Every time a number is a multiple of $5$, it adds a factor of $5$ to the prime factorization. There are $8$ multiples of $5$ between $1$ and $42$. Now look at $25$. It actually has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them, so now we need to count one more. This gives a total of $8+1=9$ times the factor $5$ appears, so $42!$ has $\boxed{9}$ zeroes at the end.

Extracting Answer from: 
Every factor of 10 is going to give us an additional 0. We get a factor of 10 whenever a factor of 5 and a factor of 2 "meet". All of the even numbers will contribute a factor of 2, so we just need to find how many factors of 5 there are. $42/5=8$ with a remainder of 2, so there are 8 factors of 5 among the 42 numbers being multiplied together. $42/25=1$ with a remainder of 17, so there is 1 additional factor of 5 to consider, from the 25 whose prime factorization is $5^2$. Thus, there are a total of $8+1=\boxed{9}$ factors of 5, and therefore 9 zeroes at the end.

Extracting Answer from: 
We want to find the time when both cyclists complete an integer number of laps. Let's start by finding how many laps each cyclist completes in one hour. The first cyclist (who takes $12$ minutes per lap) completes $60/12 = 5$ laps, while the second cyclist (who takes $16$ minutes per lap) completes $60/16 = 15/4$ laps. 

Notice that after one hour, the first cyclist will be $5$ laps ahead of his starting position, while the second cyclist will be $15/4$ laps ahead of his starting position, which is the same as being $5 \cdot 15/4 = 18.75$ laps ahead of the first cyclist.

Therefore, the two cyclists will meet again when the slower cyclist completes $18.75$ more laps. We need to express this as an integer number of laps, so we round up to $19$ laps. The slower cyclist takes $16$ minutes per lap, so $19$ laps will take $19 \cdot 16 = 304$ minutes. 

We want to express the answer in the format $h:m_1m_2,$ so we convert $304$ minutes to hours and minutes: $$304 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours and } 4 \text{ minutes}.$$Therefore, the next time the two cyclists will meet is $\boxed{5:04}$ PM.

First, we prime factorize 242: $242=2\cdot 11^2$. We can take out one factor of 11 and write $242=2\cdot 11\cdot 11=22\cdot11$. Therefore, $\sqrt{242}=\sqrt{22\cdot11}$. We can simplify this to $\sqrt{22}\cdot\sqrt{11}$. Since $\sqrt{11}$ cannot be simplified further, we leave it as it is. To simplify $\sqrt{22}$, we note that $22=2\cdot 11$. Therefore, $\sqrt{22}=\sqrt{2\cdot 11}=\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{11}$. Putting it all together, we have $\sqrt{242}=\sqrt{22}\cdot\sqrt{11}=\sqrt{2}\cdot \sqrt{11} \cdot \sqrt{11} = \boxed{11\sqrt{2}}$.

A pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it if it is a multiple of 4, 6, and 10. Thus, we must first find the LCM of 4, 6, and 10. $4=2^2$, $6=2\cdot3$, and $10=2\cdot5$. For a number to be a multiple of all three of these numbers, it prime factorization must have a 2 raised to at least the second power, a 3 raised to at least the first power, and a 5 raised to at least the first power. Thus, the least common multiple is $2^2\cdot3\cdot5=60$. Thus, every 60th pot will have 3 different colored balloons on it.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to find the number of pots that have exactly three different colored balloons attached. Let's analyze each color separately.

Red balloons: Every fourth pot has a red balloon, so we can write the sequence of pot numbers with red balloons as: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 600. To find this largest number, we divide 600 by 4 and take the floor: $\lfloor 600/4 \rfloor = 150$. So the last pot with a red balloon is the 150th pot. Therefore, there are 150 pots with a red balloon.

Blue balloons: Every sixth pot has a blue balloon, so we can write the sequence of pot numbers with blue balloons as: 6, 12, 18, 24, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 600. To find this largest number, we divide 600 by 6 and take the floor: $\lfloor 600/6 \rfloor = 100$. So the last pot with a blue balloon is the 100th pot. Therefore, there are 100 pots with a blue balloon.

Yellow balloons: Every tenth pot has a yellow balloon, so we can write the sequence of pot numbers with yellow balloons as: 10, 20, 30, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 600. To find this largest number, we divide 600 by 10 and take the floor: $\lfloor 600/10 \rfloor = 60$. So the last pot with a yellow balloon is the 60th pot. Therefore, there are 60 pots with a yellow balloon.

Now we need to find the number of pots that have exactly three different colored balloons. For this to happen, a pot must have a red, blue, and yellow balloon attached. Since the red and blue balloons have a common multiple in 12, this means that the pot must be a multiple of 12. Therefore, we need to count the number of pots that are multiples of 12 and also have a yellow balloon attached. These pots occur every 60th pot, so we need to divide the multiples of 12 that are less than or equal to 600 by 60.

To do this, we first find the largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 600. We divide 600 by 12 and take the floor: $\lfloor 600/12 \rfloor = 50$. So the largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 600 is 50*12 = 600.

Next, we count the number of multiples of 12 that are less than or equal to 600 and also have a yellow balloon attached. These occur every tenth multiple of 12, so we divide by 10: $\lfloor 50/10 \rfloor = 5$. Therefore, there are 5 pots that are multiples of 12 and also have a yellow balloon attached.

Thus, the total number of pots with three different colored balloons attached is the sum of the number of pots with each individual color, minus the number of pots with two colors (which is the sum of all possible combinations of two colors), plus the number of pots with three colors (which we just found): $$150 + 100 + 60 - \binom{3}{2}(12 + 20 + 30) + 5 = \boxed{123}.$$

Let $S$ be the sum of all of Brian's test scores up to this point, and let $n$ be the number of tests Brian has taken up to this point. Thus the arithmetic mean of his scores now is $\frac{S}{n}$ and the arithmetic mean of his scores after getting a 98 on the last test will be $\frac{S+98}{n+1}$. This gives the system of equations: \begin{align*}
\frac{S}{n} &= 91 & \frac{S+98}{n+1} & = 92
\end{align*} From the first equation we have $S = 91n$. Substituting this into the second equation gives: \begin{align*}
\frac{S+98}{n+1} &= 92\\
S+98 &= 92(n+1)\\
91n+98 &= 92n+92\\
92n-91n&= 98-92\\
n&= 6

Let $n$ be the number of tests Brian took before the last test. Then we know that the sum of his scores before the last test was $91n$, and the sum of his scores including the last test will be $92(n+1)$. We also know that his score on the last test was 98. Therefore, we have the equation: $$91n + 98 = 92(n+1)$$ Simplifying this equation, we get: $$91n + 98 = 92n + 92$$ $$6 = n$$ Therefore, Brian took $n+1=7$ tests, including the last test.

If we add those numbers of seniors up, we still have to subtract the number of seniors that are taking both history and science because we counted them twice.

Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. 

We know that the total number of seniors is the sum of those taking history and those taking science, minus the number taking both: 

Total = History + Science - Both 

We have the values for History and Science: 

Total = 106 + 109 

But we still need to find the value for Both. We know that 85 seniors are taking both history and science, so: 

Total = 106 + 109 - 85 

Total = 130 

Therefore, there are 130 seniors in the class.

Recalling that "as much" means "times" here and "half" means "1/2," we see that Stacy wants to use $\frac{1}{2}\times 3\frac{4}{5}$ cups of flour. To multiply, we first convert $3\frac45$ to a fraction:  \[
3\frac{4}{5} = 3 + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{3\cdot 5}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{15}{5} + \frac{4}{5} = \frac{19}{5}.
\]Now we multiply by 1/2:  \[
\frac{1}{2} \times 3 \frac45 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{19}{5} = \frac{1\cdot 19}{2\cdot 5} = \frac{19}{10}.
\]Finally, we convert 19/10 to a mixed number. When we divide 19 by 10, we get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 9. So \[
\frac{19}{10} = \frac{10+9}{10} = \frac{10}{10}+ \frac{9}{10} = 1 + \frac{9}{10} = \boxed{1\frac{9}{10}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since Kent won $25\%$ of the games he played, we know he must have won $\frac{25}{100}$ of the total number of games he played. We also know that he lost 12 games. Let $x$ be the total number of games he played. Then, we can write the equation:

$$\frac{25}{100}x + 12 = x$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$0.25x + 12 = x$$

Subtracting $0.25x$ from both sides, we get:

$$12 = 0.75x$$

Dividing both sides by $0.75$, we get:

$$x = \frac{12}{0.75} = 16$$

Therefore, Kent played a total of 16 games on Saturday. Since he lost 12 games, he must have won $16-12=\boxed{4}$ games.

Extracting Answer from: 
The number 1 to any power is always 1, so no matter how many times Hypatia and Euclid cube their numbers, they will both always have the number 1. Thus, Hypatia and Euclid both write down the number 1.


Now, lets take a look at Pythagoras. He keeps cubing his result 20 times starting with the number 2. The numbers he has are \begin{align*}
2^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}8 \\
8^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}512 \\
512^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}134217728 \\
\vdots
\end{align*}We can see that these numbers get out of hand pretty quickly (no wonder it took them so long), so instead, we look at the sum of the results because that is what we are trying to find. Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$. Because the number Ptolemy chose is the negation of what Pythagoras chose, after a certain number of cubes, whatever Pythagoras has, Ptolemy will have the opposite of that. Thus, whatever gigantic number Pythagoras has at the end of the game, Ptolemy will have the negation of that number, and they will add to zero.

Thus, our desired sum is  \begin{align*}1+1&+(\text{some huge number}) + (-\text{the same huge number})\\
&=1+1+0=\boxed{2}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Hypatia and Euclid both chose the number 1, so their final numbers are both 1. Now we just need to find the final numbers for Pythagoras and Ptolemy. 

Pythagoras chose 2, so his final number is $2^{20}\approx1048576$. 

Ptolemy chose -2, so his final number is $(-2)^{20}=2^{20}=1048576$. 

Therefore, the sum of the numbers they wrote is $1+1+1048576+1048576=\boxed{2097154}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the number of ounces of zinc in the trumpet. We know that the trumpet contains 80% copper and 20% zinc, so the total weight of the trumpet is $48\text{ oz} + x$ ounces. 

Since 80% of the trumpet is copper, we can set up the following equation:

$$
0.8(48\text{ oz} + x) = 48\text{ oz}
$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$
38.4\text{ oz} + 0.8x = 48\text{ oz}
$$

Subtracting $38.4\text{ oz}$ from both sides, we get:

$$
0.8x = 9.6\text{ oz}
$$

Dividing both sides by $0.8$, we get:

$$
x = 12\text{ oz}
$$

Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ ounces of zinc in the trumpet.

Let $x$ be the average number of points Heidi has scored on each test prior to the final exam. Then, when the final exam is included, she will have taken a total of $7$ tests, so her total number of points will be $7x$.

We begin by drawing a picture to help us visualize the problem:

draw(A--B--C--D--A);
draw(C--B);

label("$D$",D,N);
label("$h$",(6,7));
label("$12$",(1,8)--(14,8),N);
label("$20$",(0,0)--(20,0),S);
[/asy]

Let $h$ denote the height of triangle $ABC$. Since triangle $ACB$ and triangle $ACD$ share a base $AC$ and lie between parallel lines, they have the same height. Thus, the area of $ACD$ is $\frac{1}{2}(12)(h) = 6h$. 

The trapezoid $ABCD$ can be divided into two triangles and a rectangle, as shown below:

[asy]
pair A=(0,0), B=(20,0), C=(10,8), D=(2,8);
draw(A--B--C--D--A);
draw(C--B);
draw(D--(D.x,B.y)--B,dashed);
label("$A$",A,S);

label("$20$",(0,0)--(20,0),S);
label("$20$",(D.x,B.y)--B,S);
label("$4h$",(A.x,C.y)--C,N);
[/asy]

The area of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $(20)(h+4h) = 100h$. The area of triangle $ADB$ is $\frac{1}{2}(20)(4h) = 40h$. Thus, the area of $ACB$ is equal to the area of $ACD$ minus the area of $ADB$, or $6h - 40h = -34h$. 

Finally, we compute the ratio of the area of $ACB$ to the area of $ABCD$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Area of } ACB}{\text{Area of } ABCD} &= \frac{-34h}{100h}\\
&= \boxed{-\frac{17}{50}}\\

Since $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$, we know $BC=CD$. Also, $AD+DC=AC$, so we just need to find $BC$ and $AD$.

We can see that $\triangle AEB$ is a right triangle, so by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have \[AB=\sqrt{AE^2+BE^2}=\sqrt{40^2+20^2}=20\sqrt{5}.\] Since $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$, then $BC=CD$, so $BD=BC+CD=2\cdot BC$. In triangle $\triangle ABD$, we have \[BD=\sqrt{AB^2+AD^2},\] so \[2BC=\sqrt{AD^2+20^2}.\] In triangle $\triangle BCD$, we have \[BD^2=BC^2+CD^2,\] so \[AB^2+4BC^2=BD^2 = (2BC)^2 = 4BC^2,\] which implies $AB=0$, a contradiction. Thus, our assumption that $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BD}$ is false and $C$ is actually the midpoint of $\overline{AE}$.

Therefore, $AC=AE-EC=40-10=\boxed{30\text{ cm}}$.

First, we simplify the first part of the expression by using a common denominator of $3$. \begin{align*}\left(2-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right)&=\left(2\cdot \frac{3}{3}-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{6-4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right).\end{align*}Next we simplify the second part of the expression by using a common denominator of $4$: \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{2}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right)&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{2-3}{4}\right)\\
&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)\\
&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right).
\end{align*}Finally, we can subtract the two fractions using a common denominator of $12$. \begin{align*}
\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)&=\left(\frac{2}{3}\cdot \frac{4}{4}\right)-\left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{3}{3}\right)\\
&=\frac{8-3}{12}=\boxed{\frac{5}{12}}.

We simplify $\left(2-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right)$ by first working inside the parentheses. We have \begin{align*}
\left(2-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) &= \left(\frac{2\cdot 3}{1\cdot 3}-\frac{4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3\cdot 1}{4\cdot 1}\right)\\ &= \left(\frac{6-4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right).
\end{align*} Now, we have to subtract fractions with different denominators. We have \begin{align*} \left(\frac{6-4}{3}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\right) &= \frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{3}{4}\\ &= \frac{8+6-9}{12}=\boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.

Both right triangles are 30-60-90 triangles. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg in each triangle is half the hypotenuse, and the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg.  We apply these facts to each triangle, starting with $\triangle AOB$ and working clockwise.

From $\triangle AOB$, we find $AB = AO/2 = 8$ and $BO = AB\sqrt{3}=8\sqrt{3}$.

From $\triangle BOC$, we find $BC = BO/2 =4\sqrt{3}$ and $CO = BC\sqrt{3} =4\sqrt{3}\cdot\sqrt{3} = \boxed{12}$.

$\begin{array}{cc} \textbf{Factor Pairs of 54} & \textbf{Values for } x \textbf{ and } y \\ (1,54) &  \text{Not possible} \\ (2,27) & x=2, y=27/2\approx 13.5\text{ (not an integer)} \\ (3,18) & x=3, y=18/3=6 \\ (6,9) &  x=6, y=9/6=3 \\ (9,6) &   x=9, y=6/9<1\text{ (not possible)} \\ (18,3) &  x=18, y=3/18<1\text{ (not possible)}\\ (27,2) &  x=27, y=2/27<1\text{ (not possible)} \\ (54,1) & x=54, y=1<5\text{ (not possible)}  \end{array}$

Extracting Answer from: 
The five smallest primes are $2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 7$, and $11$. Their product is $2\times 3\times 5\times 7\times 11=11,\!550$. The problem asks us to find the remainder when $11,\!550$ is divided by $42$. Since $42$ is the least common multiple of $2,\ 3,\ $and $7$, we know that any number that is divisible by all three of these numbers is also divisible by $42$. Checking to see which of these numbers divides $11,\!550$, we find that: $$11,\!550=2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7\cdot 11=2\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot (5\cdot11)=2\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot 55.$$Therefore, $11,\!550$ leaves the same remainder upon division by $42$ as $2\cdot 3\cdot 7\cdot 55$. We can find this remainder by computing: \begin{align*}
2\times 3 \times 7 \times 55 & = 2\times 3 \times 7 \times (6\times 9 + 1) \\
&= 2\times 3 \times 7\times 6 \times 9 + 2\times 3 \times 7 \times 1 \\
&= 6\times 9\times 14 + 42 \\
&= 6\times (9\times 14 + 7) \\
&= 6\times 133 \\
&= 798.

Label the center of the semicircle $O$. Segment $OC$ is a radius of the semicircle and $\angle COB$ is a right angle. Therefore, $CB=5$ and $OB=5$ (since the radius is 5) and $\triangle COB$ is isosceles. By symmetry, $AO=5$, and $\triangle AOB$ is isosceles. It follows that $AB=5\sqrt{2}$. The region consists of three parts: a square with sides $5\sqrt{2}$, with the quarter circles at opposite corners, and a semicircle with diameter $AB$. The area of the square is $(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 50$.  The quarter circles each have area $\frac{1}{4}\pi(5)^2 = \frac{25}{4}\pi$, and the semicircle has area $\frac{1}{2}\pi(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \frac{25}{4}\pi$. So the total area of the region is $50 + 2(\frac{25}{4}\pi) = \boxed{25\pi + 50}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the mean of the heights of the 5 tallest buildings in Los Angeles before the new building was built was 733, the sum of their heights must have been $5\cdot733 = 3665$. After the new building is built, the shortest of these, which was 625 feet tall, is replaced as a member of the five tallest buildings, which, since it is 885 feet tall, is $885-625 = 260$ feet taller. Therefore the sum of the heights of the five tallest buildings increases by 260 feet, to $3665 + 260 = 3925$ feet. This means that the new mean height of the 5 tallest buildings is $\frac{3925}{5}=785$ feet, so the mean has increased by $785-733=\boxed{52}$ feet. Note that this amount is just the difference in the height of the two buildings divided by 5.

Answer from Original: 52

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1365_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by calculating the total height of the five tallest buildings in 1985:

Total height = 858 + (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)

where x1, x2, x3, and x4 are the heights of the four remaining buildings.

We know that the mean height is 733 feet, so we can write:

Total height / 5 = 733

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Total height = 3665

Substituting back into the first equation, we have:

3665 = 858 + (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4)

Simplifying further:

x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 2807

Now we can calculate the new mean height if a building of 885 feet is added:

(Total height + 885) / 6 = (3665 + 885) / 6 = 809.33

So the new mean height would be approximately 809.33 feet.

To find out how much it increased from the original mean height, we can subtract:

809.33 - 733 = 76.33

Therefore, the new building would increase the mean height of the five tallest buildings in Los Angeles by 76.33 feet.

Recall that $-(x+y)=-x-y$ for all $x$ and $y$. Thus,  $$317^{3}+8^{3}-(2^{(3^{2})}+317^{3})=317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}.$$ Using the commutative property of addition, we can rearrange the terms to get  \begin{align*}
317^{3}+8^{3}-2^{(3^{2})}-317^{3}&=317^{3}+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})+(-317^{3})\\
&=317^{3}+(-317^{3})+8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})\\

\end{align*} Since a number and its negation sum to $0$, we are left with $8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})$. Because $8=2^3$, we get $$8^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})})=(2^{3})^{3}+(-2^{(3^{2})}).$$ From the properties of exponents, we know that $(a^{m})^{n}=a^{mn}$ so $(2^{3})^{3}=2^9$.

Based on the histogram, we can make an educated guess that the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast will be around $2$ or $3$ (simply because there are a large number of years for which no hurricanes or only one hurricane reached the east coast). To this end, we begin by calculating the number of years in which three to seven hurricanes reached the east coast: $12 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 21$. There are $5 + 14 = 19$ years in which zero or one hurricanes reached the east coast. Thus, the median number of hurricanes per year reaching the east coast is $\boxed{2}$.

The median is the middle value when the numbers are listed in order. We need to add up the counts in each bar until we reach the 84th year (half of the total of 168 years). Since there are $14$ years with one hurricane and $17$ years with two, the $31$st year will be one with two hurricanes. The $48$th year will be the first year with three hurricanes (because $31+17 = 48$). Continuing in this manner, we come up with the following chart:

$$\begin{array}{c|c} \textbf{Number of hurricanes} & \textbf{Years with this number of hurricanes} \\ \hline 1 & 14 \\ 2 & 17 \\ 3 & 13 \\ 4 & 6 \\ 5 & 3 \\ 6 & 2 \\ 7 & 0 \\ 8 & 1 \end{array}$$

Aditi's speed is 1.7 miles per 0.5 hours, or 3.4 miles per hour. To walk 17 miles at this speed, we can set up a proportion: 

3.4 miles / 1 hour = 17 miles / x hours

We can solve for x by cross-multiplying:

3.4x = 17

x = 5

However, if we simply increase the price by $25\%$, and then scale the package size down to 32 ounces from 48 ounces, these are the same calculations, but in a different order that makes it easier to calculate.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1387_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by finding the price per ounce of the 48-ounce size. If it costs $\$3.90$ for 48 ounces, then the price per ounce is $\frac{3.90}{48} \approx 0.08125$ dollars per ounce. 

We want the price per ounce of the smaller size to be $25\%$ more than this, so we need to add $25\%$ of $0.08125$ to the price per ounce of the larger size. To do this, we multiply $0.08125$ by 1.25: 

$$0.08125 \cdot 1.25 \approx 0.10156$$ 

So the price per ounce of the smaller size should be about $0.10156$ dollars per ounce. 

Now we just need to find the total price for 32 ounces at this price per ounce: 

$$0.10156 \cdot 32 = \boxed{ \$3.25}$$ 

So the company should charge $\$3.25$ for the smaller size if it wants the price per ounce to be $25\%$ more than the price per ounce of the larger size.

We obtain fractions equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}$ by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.

The sum of the numerator and denominator of $\frac{5}{8}$ is $13,$ so when we multiply the numerator and denominator by the same number, the sum of the numerator and denominator is also multiplied by this same number.

Since $91 = 13 \times 7,$ then we should multiply the numerator and denominator both by $7$ to get a fraction $$\frac{5\times 7}{8 \times 7} = \frac{35}{56}$$equivalent to $\frac{5}{8}$ whose numerator and denominator add up to $91.$

We want to find the smallest number of cats that are black but do not catch mice, so we will label this part of our Venn diagram $x$. We will also let $y$ represent the number of cats with black fur that also catch mice, and $z$ represent the number of cats that do not have black fur but do catch mice.

label("${\bf y}$",(5.5,4));
label("${\bf z}$",(8.3,4));
label("${\bf x}$",(2.7,4));
[/asy]

We know that there are 17 cats that don't catch mice, so there are 24-17=7 cats that do catch mice. This tells us that $y+z=7.$ There are 10 cats with black fur, so $x+y=10$. The value of $x$ will be as small as possible when the value of $y$ is as large as possible. The largest value $y$ can be is $7$, since $y+z=7$. If $y=7$, then $x$ must equal $3$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $17$ cats do not catch mice, then $24-17=7$ cats do.  Since there are $10$ black cats, then there are $24-10=14$ cats of other colors.  If all the cats that do not catch mice are not black, then there must be at least $14$ cats that do not catch mice but have to be a color other than black.  Therefore, there must be at least $14$ cats that do not catch mice that are not black. To achieve the minimum, all of the cats that do not catch mice and not black must also be different from each other.  Thus, there must be a minimum of $17+14=\boxed{31}$ cats in Jenny's grandmother's herd that do not catch mice that are not black.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, as each die has 6 possible outcomes and there are 6 choices for the first die and 6 choices for the second die.  To find the probability of rolling a sum of 9, we can list all the possible outcomes of rolling two dice:

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline\hline
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\

\end{tabular}

There are 4 ways to get a sum of 9, namely (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3).  Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 9 is $\dfrac{4}{36} = \boxed{\dfrac19}$.

First let's calculate $a$. The sum of the numbers is $13+14+22+52+63+74=238$. $238$ rounded to the nearest ten gives us $a=240$.

Now let's calculate $b$. Rounding $13, 14, 22, 52, 63, 74$ each to the nearest ten, we get $10, 10, 20, 50, 60, 70$ respectively. This means that $b=10+10+20+50+60+70=220$. Therefore,  $$a-b=240-220=\boxed{20}.$$

Assume that we start with a stock  worth $100$ dollars.  After Monday's $10\%$ loss, the stock is worth $90$ dollars.  On Tuesday, the stock lost $20\%$ of the value it had at the end of Monday, so it lost $20\%$ of $90$ dollars, which is $18$ dollars.  Thus, the stock was worth $90-18=72$ dollars at the end of Tuesday.  Overall, then, the stock lost $28$ dollars, which is $28\%$ of its original value of $100$ dollars.  Thus, the overall percent loss is $\boxed{28\%}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by assigning variables. Let x be the width of the original garden. Then, the length of the original garden is 2x. 

The perimeter of the original garden is 2(x + 2x) = 6x. 

When the dimensions are increased, the new perimeter is twice the original perimeter, which is 2(6x) = 12x. Since the new shape is a square, each side has a length of 12x/4 = 3x. 

We are told that the area of the new square is 3600 square feet: 

(3x)^2 = 3600 

9x^2 = 3600 

x^2 = 400 

x = 20 

So the original garden had a width of 20 feet and a length of 2x = 40 feet. The area of the original garden is: 

20 * 40 = 800 square feet.

Now consider the two $3$s to appear in the units and hundreds places. The numbers will be in the $300$s, so we don't need to worry about if they are between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the tens digit, but we have already counted $333$, so such a scenario will add nine numbers. Finally, consider the two $3$s to appear in the tens and hundreds places. Again, these numbers are automatically between $100$ and $500$. There are $10$ choices for the units digit, but we again discard $333$ for a final count of nine such numbers.

The third digit can be any of the 10 options. This means that there are $3 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 = 270$ integers in between 100 and 399 that do not have at least two 3s as digits. 

Next, consider the integers in between 400 and 499. For any one of these integers, the first digit is fixed at 4, the second digit can be any of the 10 options, except for 3. The third digit can also be any of the 10 options, except for 3. This means that there are $1 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 81$ integers in between 400 and 499 that do not have at least two 3s as digits. 

Therefore, the total number of integers in between 100 and 500 that do have at least two 3s as digits is $400 - (270 + 81) = \boxed{49}$.

Alula has already taken 7 quizzes, so after taking three more quizzes she will have 10 scores.  For these scores to have an average of 14, they must have a sum of $14\times10=140$.  The sum of 17, 10, 9, 14, 16, 8, and 10 is 84, so the three remaining scores must sum to $140-84=\boxed{56}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $n$ be the total number of quizzes that Alula has taken, including the next three. We want the sum of Alula's scores on the next three quizzes, which we'll call $x,$ so that the average of all $n$ scores is 14. We can use the formula for the average or mean:

$$\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}}.$$

Substituting, we get:

$$14 = \frac{17+10+9+14+16+8+10+x}{n}.$$

We can simplify the expression on the right side by adding up all the scores, which gives us $84+x.$ And we know that $n$ is simply the number of quizzes that Alula has taken so far plus three, or $(7+3) = 10.$ Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

$$14 = \frac{84+x}{10}.$$

To solve for $x,$ we'll start by multiplying both sides by 10:

$$140 = 84 + x.$$

Then, we'll subtract 84 from both sides:

$$56 = x.$$

Therefore, Alula must score a total of 56 points on her next three quizzes to have an overall average of 14.

Simplifying the left-hand side gives $11x - 3$, and simplifying the right-hand side gives $11x - 7$. To produce an equation that has more than one solution, we need to make the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side. This means we need to solve the equation $11x-3=11x-7.$ Notice that both sides of this equation simplify to $0x,$ which means all values of $x$ satisfy this equation.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is $180(n-2)$, where $n$ is the number of sides. That means each interior angle has a measure of $\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees. We set this equal to 170 degrees and solve for $n$. \begin{align*}
\frac{180(n-2)}{n}&=170\\

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $(n-2)\cdot 180$ degrees. Let $x$ be the number of sides of the polygon in question. Then we can write the equation:

$$170x = (x-2)\cdot 180$$

Expanding the right side gives:

$$170x = 180x - 360$$

Subtracting $170x$ from both sides gives:

$$10x = 360$$

Dividing both sides by 10 gives:

$$x = 36$$

Therefore, the polygon has $\boxed{36}$ sides.

The ratio of the radius of the smaller circle to that of the larger circle is $\frac{1}{2}$, since the diameter is half as long.  Thus, the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to that of the larger circle is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$.  Thus, the gray area is $\boxed{25\%}$ of the area of the larger circle.

To be more rigorous: if the radius of the larger circle is $r$, the radius of the smaller circle is $\frac{1}{2} r$.  Thus, the ratio of the area of the smaller to the larger is: $\frac{\pi (\frac{1}{2} r)^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{1}{4}$.

For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. If the number is of the above form, then the sum of its digits is $a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a+a=9a$. Thus, whatever digit $a$ is, the sum of its digits will always be divisible by 9. Thus, to minimize the 9 digit number, the number is $\boxed{111, \! 111, \! 111}$.

A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since we want a number of the form $aaa, \! aaa, \! aaa$, the sum of its digits is $9a$. Therefore, the number is divisible by 9 if and only if $9a$ is divisible by 9, which is true for all values of $a$. 

The smallest value of $a$ that gives a 9 digit number is 1, so the smallest such number is $\boxed{111,\!111,\!111}$.

Since $28=2^2\cdot 7$, a positive integer is relatively prime with $28$ if and only if it contains neither $2$ nor $7$ in its prime factorization. In other words, we want to count the number of integers between $11$ and $29$ inclusive which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $7$.

All of the odd numbers are not divisible by 2; there are 10 such numbers.  The only one of these that is divisible by 7 is 21, so there are $10- 1 =\boxed{9}$ numbers between 10 and 30 that are relatively prime with 28.

The prime factorization of 28 is $2^2 \cdot 7$. To be relatively prime with 28, a number must not have 2 or 7 as a factor. There are 9 integers between 10 and 30, so we examine them each to see which satisfy this condition:

\begin{align*}

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we want to find the relationship between pandas and alpacas. Substituting ``='' for ``as cool as,'' we know that 3 pandas = 7 cats and 2 cats = 5 alpacas. Noting that the lowest common multiple of 2 and 7 is 14, we can multiply the panda-cat equality by 2 to learn that 6 pandas = 14 cats and multiply the cat-alpaca equality by 7 to learn that 14 cats = 35 alpacas. Combining these two equalities, we see that 6 pandas = 35 alpacas. Since $70\div 35 = 2$, we can double the panda-alpaca equation to learn that 12 pandas = 70 alpacas. Therefore, $\boxed{12}$ pandas are as cool as 70 alpacas.

Alternatively, we could set up a string of fractions to ``cancel'' the units: $70\text{ alpacas} \times \frac{2\text{ cats}}{5\text{ alpacas}}\times\frac{3 \text{ pandas}}{7\text{ cats}}=\boxed{12}\text{ pandas}$.

From the first statement, we know that: 

2 cats = 5 alpacas 

Therefore, 1 cat = 2.5 alpacas 

From the second statement, we know that: 

3 pandas = 7 cats 

Therefore, 1 panda = 7/3 cats 

Now we want to find how many pandas are as cool as 70 alpacas: 

70 alpacas = 28 cats (since 1 cat = 2.5 alpacas) 

28 cats = (28/7) * 3 pandas = 12 pandas

Let $b$, $h$, $f$, and $o$ be the number of students who chose basketball, hockey, football, and other, respectively. We know that $b+o+f+h=100.$ Also, $b=3o$ and $f=h+10.$ We can use these equations to eliminate $h$ and $o:$ \begin{align*}
b+3o+f+h&=b+o+f+(h+10)\\
b+3o+f+h&=100\\
\end{align*} The last equation is the equation we want, since we want to find the percent of those who chose basketball, and $b$ is clearly in this equation. To solve it, we substitute our equation for $b$ and $f$ in terms of $h$ and $o$ and simplify: \begin{align*}

We need to find square factors of 2940.  Beginning the search, we can first see it is divisible by 10.  So, $2940=2\cdot5\cdot294$.  Looking at 294, we can see it is divisible by 2 and 3.  Taking out these factors, find that $294=2\cdot3\cdot49$.  Since $49=7^2$, there is a square factor of 2 and a square factor of 7.  The complete factorization is $2940=2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7^2$.  Therefore, $$\sqrt{2940}=\sqrt{2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7^2}=2\sqrt{3\cdot5\cdot7^2}=2\cdot7\sqrt{3\cdot5}=\boxed{14\sqrt{15}}$$

Since 3 Blinkets are equal to 7 Drinkets, we can write:

1 Drinket = 3/7 Blinkets

To convert Blinkets to Trinkets, we know that 4 Blinkets are equal to 1 Trinket. We can combine these two relationships to find how many Trinkets 56 Drinkets are worth:

56 Drinkets = 56 * (3/7) Blinkets
           = 24 Blinkets

Now we can convert Blinkets to Trinkets:

24 Blinkets = 6 Trinkets

Therefore, 56 Drinkets is worth 6 Trinkets in this system.

Extracting Answer from: 
A $3$-digit palindrome must be of the form $aba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits, and $a\neq 0$. In order for $aba$ to be divisible by $3$, we require that $a + b + a = 2a + b$ be divisible by $3$. Since $0 < a\leq 9$ and $0 \leq b \leq 9$, the maximum possible value of $2a+b$ is $2\cdot 9 + 9 = 27$.  We will list all of the multiples of $3$ from $0$ through $27$, and determine how many possibilities for $a, b$ make $2a + b$ equal to that multiple.

If $2a + b = 0$, then there are no solutions such that $a \neq 0$.
If $2a+b=3$, then $b=3-2a$, so $a=1$ is the only solution.
If $2a+b=6$, then $b=6-2a$, so $a=1,2,3$, since $a\ge 4$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=9$, then $b=9-2a$, so $a=1,2,3,4$, since $a\ge 5$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=12$, then $b=12-2a$, so $a=2,3,4,5,6$, since $a\le 1$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a\ge 7$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=15$, then $b=15-2a$, so $a=3,4,5,6,7$, since $a\le 2$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a\ge 8$ will make $b$ negative.
If $2a+b=18$, then $b=18-2a$, so $a=5,6,7,8,9$, since $a\le 4$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=21$, then $b=21-2a$, so $a=6,7,8,9$, since $a\le 5$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=24$, then $b=24-2a$, so $a=8,9$, since $a\le 7$ will make $b\ge 10$, and $a$ must be less than $10$.
If $2a+b=27$, then $b=27-2a$, so $a=9$, since as we've seen $a$ and $b$ must both be as large as possible.

In each case, a value of $a$ uniquely determines a value of $b$, so we haven't missed any palindromes. Thus the total number is $1+3+4+5+5+5+4+2+1=\boxed{30}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
A three-digit palindrome looks like $\overline{aba}$. Since $\overline{aba}\equiv a+b+a\equiv2a+b\pmod{3}$, it only depends upon $2a+b\pmod{3}$; or in other words, it suffices to check only $11$, $22$, and $33$. To count the possibilities, we see that if the 100's place is fixed, then the 1's and 10's places are also forced ($\overline{aba}$ is a palindrome), and thus there is exactly one possibility per each residue class$\pmod{3}$. Thus there are $\boxed{3}$ palindromic multiples of 3: $\underline{121}, \underline{252},$ and $\underline{363}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1439_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are two ways to approach this problem. 

Method 1: Counting

We can count the number of chairs with odd numbers by looking at each row. In each row, there are 6 chairs with odd numbers and 5 chairs with even numbers. Therefore, in each row, there are 6 chairs with odd numbers.

To find the total number of chairs with odd numbers, we can multiply the number of chairs in each row by the number of rows and then multiply by the fraction of chairs in each row that have odd numbers.

11 rows * 6 chairs per row * 1/2 fraction of chairs with odd numbers = 33 chairs with odd numbers


Method 2: Algebra

We can use algebra to find the total number of chairs with odd numbers. Let x be the number of chairs with odd numbers.

In each row, there are 11 chairs, so the number of chairs with even numbers is also 11. Therefore, the total number of chairs is:

11 rows * (11 chairs per row) = 121 chairs

We know that half of the chairs have odd numbers, so we can write:

x = 1/2 * 121

Simplifying, we get:

x = 60.5

However, this is not a whole number, so we cannot have half a chair. Therefore, we should round down to the nearest whole number, since there are always fewer chairs with odd numbers than chairs with even numbers.

The closest whole number to 60.5 is 60, so the total number of chairs with odd numbers is 60.

Extracting Answer from: 
If all six tests had grades of $90 \%$, Sallie's average would also be $90 \%$. The four tests she has average $83 \%$, $96 \%$, $81 \%$, and $82 \%$, so her total score on those four tests is $83 + 96 + 81 + 82 = 342$. Since each of the six tests is worth the same amount, the four tests she has taken contribute $\frac{4}{6}$ of her total grade, so their weighted total is $\frac{4}{6} \cdot 90 = 60$. This means she must earn a total of $60 - 342 = -282$ on the two missing tests. Since $-282$ is the sum of the scores on the two missing tests, their average is $\frac{-282}{2} = -141$. However, this average is meaningless because it represents a negative score, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no way to answer this question.

Let $n = pq = (p+10)(q-10)$ for some primes $p$ and $q$. Expanding the second expression, we have $pq - 10p + 10q - 100 = pq$, so $p + q = 10$. This means $p$ and $q$ are either both odd primes such that $p + q = 10$, or $p=2$ and $q=7$. Checking cases, we find that the smallest composite $n$ is $15$, which has two distinct prime factors $\boxed{2}$.

The first positive odd integer is 1.  To get to the 2004th positive odd integer, we must add 2 exactly 2003 times.  Make sure you see why it's not 2004 times -- that would give us the 2005th positive odd integer, just like adding one 2 to 1 gives us the second positive odd integer, not the first.

Extracting Answer from: 
Deanna can give $3$ pieces of candy to each kid, so let's subtract $3$ from the total number of candies she has: $$44 - 3 = 41.$$ Now we need to find the largest whole number that evenly divides $41$. Since $41$ is prime, the only possible answer is $1$. However, if every kid only got $1$ piece of candy, then one piece of candy would be left over. So we can't give every kid exactly the same amount of candy. 

If we give $4$ pieces of candy to each kid, we would need $4$ to divide into $41$ evenly. Testing the possible factors of $41$, we find that $41$ divided by $4$ gives a remainder of $1$. So we can't give $4$ pieces of candy to each kid either. 

If we give $5$ pieces of candy to each kid, we get $$44 - 3 = 41$$ pieces of candy, which is divisible by $5$. Therefore, we can give $\boxed{8}$ kids $5$ pieces of candy each.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that $\frac{1}{2}= \frac{2}{4}$, so we can rewrite the expression as:

$$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} $$

Now, we can add the fractions with a common denominator of 8:

$$\frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{4}{8} + \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} $$

We can simplify further by adding the numerators:

$$\frac{4+2+1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$$

Therefore, $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$.

Since the length and width are whole number values, the dimensions of rectangle $B$ must be $1\times25$ or $5\times5$. Rectangle $B$ shares a sidelength with rectangle $A$ and another sidelength with rectangle $C$, so each sidelength must also be a factor of the other rectangle's area. Since $25$ is not a factor of $40$ or $30$, it cannot be a sidelength of rectangle $B$. That means rectangle $B$ is a $5\times5$ rectangle, which makes the respective dimensions of rectangle $A$ and $C$ $8\times5$ and $5\times 6$. The area of rectangle $D$ is then $8\times6=\boxed{48}$ square meters.

To start, find a common denominator on the left side.  The lowest common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so this is the common denominator.  Rewrite the equation as: $$\frac{4x}{12}+\frac{3x}{12}=14$$$$\frac{4x+3x}{12}=14$$$$\frac{7x}{12}=14$$Now, multiply both sides of the equation by $\frac{12}{7}$ to solve for $x$: $$\frac{7x}{12}\cdot\frac{12}{7}=14\cdot \frac{12}{7}$$$$x=2\cdot 12=\boxed{24}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To solve for $x$, we need to isolate $x$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by first finding a common denominator for the two fractions on the left-hand side of the equation. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$$\frac{4x}{12}+\frac{3x}{12}=14$$

Simplifying this gives:

$$\frac{7x}{12}=14$$

Now we can isolate $x$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{12}{7}$:

$$x=\frac{12}{7}\cdot14=\boxed{24}$$

[/asy] The two routes form a 9-12-15 right triangle.  Kelly drove for $9+12=21$ miles at a rate of 42 miles per hour, so she drove for $21/42=.5$ hours which equals 30 minutes.  Brenda drove for 15 miles at an average rate of 45 miles per hour, so she drove for $15/45\cdot 60=20$ minutes.  Thus, Brenda arrived $30-20=\boxed{10}$ minutes earlier than Kelly.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1451_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To solve the problem, we need to use the fact that distance = speed x time. Let's start by finding the distance that Kelly and Brenda traveled:

- Kelly traveled north for 9 miles and then east for 12 miles, so her total distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 9 and 12 miles. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find this distance: 

  distance = sqrt(9^2 + 12^2) = 15 miles

- Brenda drove along a straight road, so her distance is simply the distance between the starting point and the town of Prime. We can call this distance "x". 

Now we can use the formula distance = speed x time to set up two equations, one for Kelly and one for Brenda: 

- Kelly: 15 = 42t
- Brenda: x = 45t

where t is the time in hours. We want to find the time it took each person to travel their respective distances. 

Solving the first equation for t, we get:

t = 15/42 = 5/14 hours

Solving the second equation for x, we get:

x = 45t = 45(5/14) = 225/14 miles

Now we can use the fact that both Kelly and Brenda arrived at the same time to set up another equation relating their distances:

- Kelly's distance + Brenda's distance = total distance
- 15 + x = 225/14

Solving for x, we get:

x = 225/14 - 15 = 15/14 miles

This tells us that Brenda traveled 15/14 miles less than Kelly. To find out how much time this represents, we can use the formula distance = speed x time for Brenda:

15/14 = 45t'
where t' is the time in hours that Brenda arrived earlier than Kelly. Solving for t', we get:

t' = (15/14) / 45 = 1/42 hours

To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60:

t' = (1/42) x 60 = 10/7 minutes

Therefore, Brenda arrived 10/7 minutes (about 1.4 minutes) earlier than Kelly.

We then know that his remaining two tests must be a combined 11 points above 90, and since they differ by 3 points, we know that one test is 4 above 90, and the other is 7 above 90, meaning his highest score was $\boxed{97}$.

Let $x$ be Ed's fourth test score and $y$ be his fifth test score. We know $y=x+3$, since the difference between his last two scores is three points.

Since his average is $90\%$, his total score on the five tests is $90\% \cdot 500 = 450$. We can write an equation to represent this:

\[ (87 + 85 + 87 + x + y) \div 5 = 90\% \]
\[ (87 + 85 + 87 + x + (x+3)) \div 5 = 0.9 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ (262 + 2x + 3) \div 5 = 0.9 \]
\[ (2x + 265) = 4.5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 \]
\[ 2x + 265 = 45 \]
\[ 2x = -220 \]
\[ x = -110 \]

This doesn't make sense, because Ed's test score cannot be negative. Therefore, we made a mistake somewhere. The mistake was in assuming that Ed's highest test score was his fifth test. Since his fifth test score is $x+3$, and we just found that $x$ is negative, we know that the fifth test score is also negative.

Therefore, Ed's highest test score is actually his third test score of 87 points. Answer: $\boxed{87}$.

Answer from Original: 6

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1460_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by using algebra to solve the problem. Let's call the total amount of Carla's savings "S". Then, we know that:

Carla spent two-fifths of her savings on a bracelet, which means she has three-fifths of her savings left over. This can be expressed as:

$$\frac{3}{5}S = \$9$$

We can solve for S by multiplying both sides of the equation by $\frac{5}{3}$:

$$S = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \$9 = \$15$$

So Carla's total savings were $\$15$. Now, we can find out how much she spent on the bracelet by multiplying the fraction she spent on the bracelet by her total savings:

$$\frac{2}{5} \cdot \$15 = \$6$$

So the bracelet cost $\$6$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1462_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are different ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use conversion factors and basic arithmetic. Here is one possible solution:

- Start with the given time, 2:30 p.m., which means 2 hours and 30 minutes have passed since noon.
- Convert this time into a total number of minutes: 2 hours x 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 150 minutes.
- Add the number of seconds they have to travel, which is 7200 seconds.
- Convert this total time back into hours and minutes by dividing by 60 and taking the quotient as the new number of hours, then taking the remainder as the new number of minutes. Remember that 1 hour = 60 minutes.
- Add the new number of hours to the original hour (2) to get the final hour, and keep the new number of minutes. Note that if the new number of minutes exceeds 60, you need to add 1 hour to the final hour and subtract 60 from the minutes.
- Check if the final hour is in the afternoon (i.e., after 12:00 p.m.) and adjust the format accordingly. 

Here are the steps in detail:

- 2:30 p.m. = 2 hours x 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 150 minutes.
- 7200 seconds = 7200/60 = 120 minutes. Add this to 150 to get the total time in minutes: 150 + 120 = 270 minutes.
- 270 minutes = 4 hours x 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes. So the arrival time is 4:30 p.m.
- Since 4:30 p.m. is in the afternoon, we don't need to adjust the format.

Therefore, if Bobbi's mother is correct, they will arrive at their destination at 4:30 p.m. in the afternoon.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that two expressions are equivalent if they are equal for all valid choices of the variable or variables involved.

Question 1:  no, because the given expressions are equal only for certain values of $x$. Almost any $x$ will do: take $x=2$ and note that $\frac{2}{3(2)}=\frac{1}{3}$ while $\frac{2(2)}{3}=\frac{4}{3}$.

Question 2: no, because the second expression is $-1$ times the first expression. Thus they are only equal if each of them happens to equal 0. For example, if $h=3$, then $\frac{1-h}{2h}=\frac{1-3}{2(3)}=\frac{-2}{6}=-\frac{1}{3}$, while $\frac{h-1}{2h} = \frac{3-1}{2(3)} = \frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.

Question 3: yes, because we obtain the second expression by distributing the negative sign across the parentheses in the first expression.

Question 4: no, because the negative sign has not been properly distributed. To confirm that the expressions are not equivalent, we can choose a value like $y=3$ to find that the first expression becomes $-(3+3)=-6$ while the second expression is $-3+3=0$.

Question 5: yes, because we can multiply $\frac{1}{2}$ by $j$ in the usual way by writing $j$ as $\frac{j}{1}$. We get \[
\frac{1}{2}j = \frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{j}{1} = \frac{1\cdot j}{2\cdot 1} = \frac{j}{2}.
\]

Question 6: yes, by the commutative property of addition.

The questions whose answers are yes are 3, 5, and 6. The sum of these numbers is $\boxed{14}$.

We want to have the least common denominator, $2 \cdot 3 = 6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions.  We write one half as $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{3}{6}$. Also, we write one third as $\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2}{6}.$ Adding these, we obtain $\frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{5}{6}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The common denominator for $\frac{1}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ is $6$. We rewrite each fraction with denominator $6$, giving $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6}+\frac{2}{6}.$$Adding the corresponding numerators of these fractions, we get $$\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6}+\frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}.$$Therefore, $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{5}{6}}$.

Of the $7$ students that have been to Mexico, $4$ have also been to England. Therefore, $7-4=3$ students have been to Mexico and not England.

Of the $11$ students that have been to England, $4$ have also been to Mexico. Therefore, $11-4=7$ students have been to England and not Mexico.

Therefore, $3$ students have been to Mexico only, $7$ students have been to England only, and $4$ students have been to both. In the class of $30$ students, this leaves $30-3-7-4=\boxed{16}$ students who have not been to Mexico or England.

We begin by drawing a Venn diagram with two circles, one representing Mexico and the other representing England. We label the intersection of the circles (where the two circles overlap) with the number $4$, since $4$ students have been to both countries. We label the part of the Mexico circle that does not overlap with the England circle (the part outside the England circle) with $x$ since we want to find the number of students who have not been to either country. Similarly, we label the part of the England circle that does not overlap with the Mexico circle (the part outside the Mexico circle) with $y$, as shown below.

label("$4$",(60,50));
label("$x$?",(-60,50));
label("$y$?",(190,50));

We know that there are $7$ students who have been to Mexico, so $x+4=7$, which means $x=3$. We also know that there are $11$ students who have been to England, so $y+4=11$, which means $y=7$.

Therefore, the number of students who have not been to either Mexico or England is $x+y=\boxed{10}$.

Let $n$ be a two-digit positive integer whose product of the digits is 12. Then $n$ can be written in the form $ab$ where $a$ and $b$ are the tens and units digits of $n$, respectively. We know that $a$ and $b$ are both positive integers less than 10, and that $ab = 12$. 

The possible pairs $(a,b)$ that multiply to 12 are: $(1,12)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,4)$. Therefore, there are three possible values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy the conditions: $(1,12)$, $(2,6)$, and $(3,4)$. Thus, there are $\boxed{3}$ two-digit positive integers whose product of the digits is 12.

Each good worker can paint $1/12$ of my house in an hour, so three of them together can  paint $3/12 =1/4$ of my house in an hour.  So, in 3 hours, the three good workers will  paint $3(1/4)=3/4$ of my house.  The bad workers have to paint the other $1/4$ of the house.  Each bad worker paints $1/36$ of the house in an hour, so each bad worker can paint $3(1/36)=1/12$  of the house in three hours.

Extracting Answer from: 
Three good workers can paint the house in $12/3=4$ hours, so the rate at which one good worker can paint the house is $1/4$ of the job per hour.  Similarly, each bad worker can paint the house at a rate of $1/36$ of the job per hour.  Let $x$ be the number of bad workers we need.  Together, 3 good workers and $x$ bad workers can paint the house in 3 hours, so their combined rate of painting is $1$ job per 3 hours.  Thus the equation \begin{align*}
3\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)+x\left(\frac{1}{36}\right)&=1\\

A soccer pass differs from a handshake in that Person A passing the ball to Person B is clearly different from Person B passing the ball to Person A. Therefore, there are $11$ members of the team who can pass the ball to $10$ other members, meaning that there are $11 \cdot 10 = 110$ possible passes between two members of the team. Each member must pass the ball to each of the other members three times, so we multiply $110$ by $3$ to obtain $\boxed{330},$ our answer.

Since each person must pass the ball three times to each of the other 10 team members, there are $11 \cdot 3 = 33$ passes per person. However, each pass is counted twice since it involves two people, so we need to divide by 2 to get the total number of passes: $$\frac{11 \cdot 3 \cdot 10}{2} = \boxed{165}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
If the diameter of the circle is $16$, then its radius is $8$. The area of this circle is then $\pi r^2 = \pi (8^2) = 64 \pi$. If we want the area of the new circle to be $48 \pi$ less than the area of this one, then the new circle must have an area of $64 \pi - 48 \pi = 16 \pi$. Now that we know the area of this circle, we can find its radius $R$ by setting $\pi R^2$ equal to $16 \pi$, so we have that $\pi R^2 = 16 \pi$ and $R = 4$.

The radius of the first circle was $8$ and the new radius is $4$, so the radius was decreased by $8-4=\boxed{4}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The radius of the circle is half the diameter, so it is initially $16/2=8$. Let $x$ be the amount by which we must decrease the radius in order to decrease the area by $48\pi$. The new radius will be $8-x$. 

The initial area of the circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi\cdot 8^2 = 64\pi$. If we decrease the radius by $x$, the new area will be $\pi(8-x)^2$. We want to decrease the area by $48\pi$, so we set up the equation:

\begin{align*}
\pi(8^2)-(48\pi)&=\pi(8-x)^2\\
64\pi-48\pi&=\pi(64-16x+x^2)\\
16\pi&=\pi(64-16x+x^2)\\
16&=64-16x+x^2\\
0&=x^2-16x+48\\
0&=(x-8)(x-6).
\end{align*}

The solutions to this quadratic equation are $x=8$ and $x=6$. Since we want to decrease the radius, we must choose $x=\boxed{6}$.

Solving $4n + 3 < 25$, we have $4n < 22$, or $n < \frac{22}{4}$. Thus, $n$ is less than $5$, as $5 \cdot 4 = 20 < 22$, but $6 \cdot 4 = 24 > 22$.

Solving $-7n + 5 < 24$, we have $-7n < 19$, or $n > -\frac{19}{7}$. Thus, $n$ is greater than $-3$, as $3 \cdot 7 = 21 > 19$, but $2 \cdot 7 = 14 < 19$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In order to cut all three pieces of timber into equal length logs, the length of the logs must be a factor of each of the three original lengths. The prime factors of 48 are $2^4\cdot3$, those of 72 are $2^3\cdot3^2$, and those of 40 are $2^3\cdot5$. The greatest common factor of all three is $2^3=\boxed{8}$, so that is the greatest possible length the sawmill operator can cut.

Answer from Original: 8

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1505_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of the lengths of the timber. We can use prime factorization to do this:

48 = 2^4 × 3
72 = 2^3 × 3^2
40 = 2^3 × 5

The GCF is the product of the common factors raised to the lowest power:

GCF = 2^3 × 3 = 24

Therefore, the sawmill operator can cut the timber into logs that are 24 feet long, with no waste. The 48-foot piece can be cut into two logs, the 72-foot piece can be cut into three logs, and the 40-foot piece can be cut into one log and a leftover piece of 16 feet. So, the greatest possible length of the logs is 24 feet.

Extracting Answer from: 
If $4$ wands are equivalent to $6$ rands, we can simplify by dividing both sides by $2$ to get $2$ wands are equivalent to $3$ rands. Similarly, if $24$ rands are equivalent to $8$ fands, we can simplify by dividing both sides by $8$ to get $3$ rands are equivalent to $1$ fand. Thus, we have:

\begin{align*}
2\text{ wands} &\longleftrightarrow 3 \text{ rands}\\
3\text{ rands} &\longleftrightarrow 1 \text{ fand}
\end{align*}

To find out how many wands are equivalent to $5$ fands, we can use these two equivalences to set up a proportion:

$$
\frac{2 \text{ wands}}{3\text{ rands}} = \frac{x \text{ wands}}{5\text{ fands}}
$$

where $x$ is the unknown number of wands we want to find. We can solve for $x$ by cross-multiplying:

\begin{align*}
2 \text{ wands} \cdot 5\text{ fands} &= 3 \text{ rands} \cdot x \text{ wands}\\
10\text{ wands} &= 3 \text{ rands} \cdot x \text{ wands}\\
\frac{10\text{ wands}}{3\text{ rands}} &= x\\
\frac{10}{3} \text{ wands} &= x
\end{align*}

Therefore, $5$ fands are equivalent to $\boxed{\frac{10}{3}}$ wands.

To find out how many multiples there are that fit this description, first we find all the positive multiples, which are 6, 12, 18, and 24. Since 30 is greater than 25, it doesn't match the description and we now know that there are 4 positive multiples of 6 that are less than 25.

Because the limits for negative multiples are the same as the limits for positive multiples, we can figure out that the only negative multiples that are greater than -25 are -6, -12, -18, and -24.

Four positive multiples, four negative multiples, and zero (because $6 \cdot 0=0$) means that there are $\boxed{9 \text{ multiples}}$ that will work.

10^2\left(7.\overline{7}\right) &= 777.\overline{7}, \\
10^1\left(-4.\overline{4}\right) &= -44.\overline{4}, \\
10^0\left(2.\overline{2}\right) &= 2.\overline{2}.
\end{align*}Our sum is thus $777.\overline{7} - 44.\overline{4} + 2.\overline{2}$. From this, we can subtract the sum $444.\overline{4}$ from itself to obtain an integer: $$333.\overline{3}.$$Finally, we can just ignore the decimals (since we're only seeking the fraction) to obtain an answer of $\boxed{\frac{1000}{3}}$.

Let $M$ be the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 115. $M$ is both a multiple of 2, which means its units digit must be even, and a multiple of 3, which means the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3.  By the first condition, consider multiples of 2 in increasing order: 116, 118, 120, 122, etc. 116 and 118 are not multiples of 3 (since 1+1+6=8 and 1+1+8=10), but 120 is a multiple of 3. Therefore, $M=\boxed{120}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 115, we need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that $6n>115$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $n>\frac{115}{6}$. We want the smallest integer greater than this, which is 20. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 6 greater than 115 is $6\cdot 20 = \boxed{120}$.

We know that 90$\%$ of the 700 students scored ''proficient or above,'' which means that only 10$\%$ did not. To find out how many students didn't score as well, we can use cross-multiplication:

$$\frac{10}{100} \times 700 = \frac{x}{1}$$

Simplifying the left side gives us:

$$0.1 \times 700 = \frac{x}{1}$$

Multiplying 0.1 and 700 gives us:

$$70 = \frac{x}{1}$$

The sum of the angle measures in a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  So, the sum of the decagon's angles is $180(10-2) = 1440$ degrees.  The polygon is regular, so all the angles have the same measure, which means each is $\frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ$.  Similarly, the sum of the angles of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, which means each angle in a regular pentagon has measure $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

Therefore, the desired difference is $144^\circ - 108^\circ = \boxed{36^\circ}$.

A regular decagon has 10 sides, so by the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, the total sum of interior angles is $180(10-2) = 1440$ degrees. Since a decagon has 10 angles of equal measure, each angle must have measure $\frac{1440^\circ}{10} = 144^\circ$.

Similarly, a regular pentagon has 5 sides, so the total sum of interior angles is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees. Each angle in a regular pentagon has measure $\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ$.

Therefore, the measure of an interior angle of a regular decagon is $144^\circ - 108^\circ = \boxed{36^\circ}$ greater than the measure of an interior angle of a regular pentagon.

Let $n$ be the desired integer. We have $$\gcd(n,36)=18.$$Since $18$ is a divisor of $36,$ it follows that $18$ must also be a divisor of $n.$ Thus, we can write $n=18a$ for some integer $a.$ Substituting, we get $$\gcd(18a,36)=18.$$Using the fact that $\gcd(x,y)=\gcd(x,x-y),$ it follows that $$\begin{aligned} \gcd(18a,36) &= \gcd(18a,36-18a) \\ &= \gcd(18a,18) \\ &= 18\cdot\gcd(a,1). \end{aligned}$$Since $\gcd(a,1)=1,$ it follows that $\gcd(18a,36)=18$ if and only if $\gcd(a,1)=1.$ Therefore, $n=18a$ is divisible by $18$ but not by $36$ if and only if $a$ is an integer not divisible by $2$ or $3.$ The smallest such integer greater than $200$ is $a=223,$ so the smallest integer greater than $200$ for which $\gcd(n,36)=18$ is $$n=18a=18\cdot223=\boxed{4014}.$$

Raising 42 to powers could get really messy really quickly, so let's avoid substituting immediately, and see if there is a way to simplify the expression first.

Recall that $\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)^n=\frac{1}{x^n}$, so we can rewrite $\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)^4$ as $\frac{1}{a^4}$. Thus, we have  \[\frac{1}{a^4} \cdot 2 \cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\]Because multiplication is commutative, we can rearrange the terms to get  \[2 \cdot \frac{1}{a^4} \cdot a^4+a^{2+1-3}.\]Any nonzero number times its reciprocal is 1, so this can be simplified to \[2 \cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3}.\]Simplifying the numbers in the exponent of $a$, we find that it simplifies to $a^0$. Because any number to the zero power is 1, this simplifies to 1. Thus, we have \begin{align*}
2 \cdot 1 +a^{2+1-3} &=2 + a^0 \\
&=2+1 \\

We can simplify the first term by using the rule $(a^{-n})^m= a^{-nm}$, which gives $\left(\frac{1}{42}\right)^4 = 42^{-4}$. Using the rule $a^{-n}=\frac{1}{a^n}$, we have $42^{-4}= \frac{1}{42^{4}}$. Hence, we can now simplify the first term to $\frac{1}{42^4} \cdot 2 \cdot 42^4=2$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The complement of an angle is the angle that, when added to the original angle, equals 90 degrees. So if the complement of angle $M$ is 10 degrees, we have:

$$M + 10^\circ = 90^\circ$$

Subtracting 10 degrees from both sides gives:

$$M = 80^\circ$$

Therefore, angle $M$ has a measure of $\boxed{80^\circ}$.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $n$ sides is $180(n-2)$. The pentagon has 5 sides, so the sum of the interior angles is $180\cdot3$. We subtract the degree measures of the two right angles to get $180\cdot3-90-90=180\cdot2$, which is the sum of the measures of the three congruent interior angles. We divide by 3 to get the measure of one of the three congruent interior angles: $\frac{180\cdot2}{3}=60\cdot2=\boxed{120^\circ}$.

Let the starting point be $A$. Let $B$ be the point that is $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south of $A$, and let $C$ be the point that is $\frac{5}{4}$ miles east of $B$, so that the length of segment $BC$ is $\frac{3}{4}$ mile. Finally, let $D$ be the point that is $\frac{1}{2}$ mile south of $C$. We want to find the length of segment $AD$, which is the shortest distance from Bill's ending point to his starting point.

[asy]

The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB = \frac{1}{2}$ and $BC = \frac{3}{4}$, so $AC = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} \approx 0.91$. Similarly, $CD = \frac{1}{2}$, so $AD = AC + CD = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \approx 1.41$.

Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since there are 12 red cars and 15 4-door cars, the number of red 2-door cars is $12-x$, while the number of white 4-door cars is $15-x$.  The sum of the number of red 4-doors, red 2-doors, white 4-doors, and white 2-doors is the total number of cars (20), because each car is contained in exactly one of these categories.  Since the number of white 2-doors is 4, we have $x + (12 - x) + (15 - x) + 4 = 20$, which makes $x = \boxed{11}$.

Let $r$ be the number of red 2-door cars, $w$ be the number of white 2-door cars, $R$ be the number of red 4-door cars, and $W$ be the number of white 4-door cars. We have the following system of equations:

\begin{align*}
r + w + R + W &= 20\\
r + R &= 12\\
R + W &= 15\\
w &= 4
\end{align*}

We want to find $R$. We can solve for $R$ by adding the second and third equations:

$$R + r + W = 27$$

Substituting in $w=4$ and $R+W=15$, we get:

$$R + r + 15 - R = 27$$

Simplifying, we get $r = 12$. 

Now we can find $R$ by substituting in $r=12$ and $R+W=15$ into the third equation:

$$12 + R = 15$$

So $R=3$. 

Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ red 4-door cars in the parking lot.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since there are $2$ dozen or $24$ cupcakes, we begin by finding the number of cupcakes that did contain one or more of the ingredients. Let $x$ be the number of cupcakes that contained chocolate, $y$ be the number of cupcakes that contained raisins, $z$ be the number of cupcakes that contained chocolate chips, and $w$ be the number of cupcakes that contained nuts. It follows that \begin{align*}
x+y+z+w&=(1/2)(24)=12\text{ cupcakes contained one or more of the ingredients}.
\end{align*}Note that we seek to maximize the number of cupcakes that contained none of the ingredients, which is equivalent to minimizing the number of cupcakes that contained one or more of the ingredients. The least possible value of each variable $x, y, z,$ and $w$ is zero and the greatest possible value of $x$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot24=12$, the greatest possible value of $y$ is $\frac{2}{3}\cdot24=16$, the greatest possible value of $z$, is $\frac{1}{4}\cdot24=6$, and the greatest possible value of $w$ is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot24=4$. Then,  $$x+y+z+w\ge0+0+0+0=0,$$so up to the greatest value for each cupcake ingredient can give us at least $0$ cupcakes with none of those ingredients. The maximum is actually attainable in this case; we accomplish it when $x=12$, $y=16$, $z=6$, and $w=4$. Thus, we obtain $$24-12-16-6-4=\boxed{-14}$$ cupcakes that had none of these ingredients.

There are $8$ people, each of whom has $7$ others to hug, making $8\cdot 7$ pairs. However, this counts each pair twice (once for each ordering of the two people). Since order doesn't matter, the actual number of hugs that must take place is $(8\cdot 7)/2,$ which is $28.$

Every week, $7$ different hugs take place, since there are $7$ positions where two people are side-by-side.

Let's number the eight people $1, 2, \ldots, 8$ and let's assume they sit in that order. Person 1 hugs people 2 and 8, person 2 hugs people 1 and 3, person 3 hugs people 2 and 4, and so on. Notice that each person in the middle (i.e. everyone except persons 1 and 8) hugs two different pairs of people, while persons 1 and 8 each hug only one different pair.

To ensure that every pair hugs at least once, we must keep track of all $\binom{8}{2}$ pairs. We can pair up the people so that every pair contains one person from the pair of people furthest left and right. Specifically, the pairs are $(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), \ldots, (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), \ldots, (7, 8)$. Therefore, we need to ensure that each of these pairs hugs at least once. Notice that every pair either contains person 1, person 8 or both. Thus, we only need to worry about the pairs that contain neither person 1 nor person 8. There are $\binom{6}{2} = 15$ such pairs. We will now show how to get all of them to hug in four weeks.

Week 1: The people sit as usual.
Week 2: Person 2 moves to the far right of the pew (next to person 8).
Week 3: Person 7 moves to the far left of the pew (next to person 1).
Week 4: Persons 3, 4, 5 and 6 rotate one seat to their right.

It's easy to verify that each of the 15 pairs hugs at least once within these four weeks. Therefore, we can guarantee that every pair of people hugs at least once within $\boxed{4}$ weeks.

The total amount eaten is $\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{5}$. The denominators have a common multiple of 35, so this is equivalent to $\frac{10}{35} + \frac{21}{35} = \frac{10 + 21}{35} = \frac{31}{35}$. Thus, the amount that Chris and Nathan didn't eat is $1 - \frac{31}{35} = \frac{35}{35} - \frac{31}{35} = \boxed{\frac{4}{35}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
If Chris eats $\frac27$ of the cookie, then $\frac57$ of the cookie is left. If Nathan eats $\frac35$ of the cookie, then $\frac25$ of the cookie is left. 

The amount of cookie left after Chris and Nathan eat is the amount that is left after both of them eat, so we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of $5$ and $7$ is $35$, so we can write:

\begin{align*}
\frac{5}{7} \cdot \frac{5}{5} &= \frac{25}{35} \\
\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{7}{7} &= \frac{14}{35}
\end{align*}

Therefore, Chris eats $\frac{25}{35}$ of the cookie and Nathan eats $\frac{14}{35}$ of the cookie. 

The fraction of the original cookie that is left is:

$$1 - \frac{25}{35} - \frac{14}{35} = \boxed{\frac{6}{35}}$$

In this equation, x represents the integer we are trying to find. We can solve for x by first subtracting 5 from both sides to isolate the term with x:

4x = 272

Then, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 68

Remember, even powers of $-1$ equal $1$, and odd powers of $-1$ equal $-1$.  Therefore, $x + x^2 = -1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  The next pair cancels out in the same way: $x^3 + x^4 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^4 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  Now, it is easy to see that the pattern continues for every pair of powers, all the way up to $x^{2009} + x^{2010}$.  Notice that $x^{2011}$ is the only power that hasn't been canceled out.  Therefore, the answer is $(-1)^{2011} = \boxed{-1}.$

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1578_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To find the average speed, we need to use the formula:

average speed = total distance / total time

First, let's find the distance Jack travels. He drives for 1 hour at 40 mph, so he travels:

distance = rate × time
distance = 40 mph × 1 hour
distance = 40 miles

He then drives for another hour at 50 mph, so he travels:

distance = rate × time
distance = 50 mph × 1 hour
distance = 50 miles

The total distance Jack travels is:

total distance = 40 miles + 50 miles
total distance = 90 miles

Now we need to find the total time that Jack drives. He drives for 1 hour at 40 mph, and then another hour at 50 mph, so the total time is:

total time = 1 hour + 1 hour
total time = 2 hours

Finally, we can use the formula to find the average speed:

average speed = total distance / total time
average speed = 90 miles / 2 hours
average speed = 45 mph

Therefore, Jack's average speed is 45 mph.

We need to find $\frac{15}{8}$ of $\frac{2}{5}.$ Since the word "of" means multiply, we need to find the product of these two fractions, $\frac{15}{8} \cdot \frac{2}{5}.$ This equals $\frac{15 \cdot 2}{8 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}$. Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\frac{3 \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{2}}{\cancel{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cancel{5}} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 2}$. Thus, we find the answer is $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$

Since the original rectangle has a length of $6$ inches and a width of $10$ inches, its length-to-width ratio is $\frac{6}{10}=\frac{3}{5}$.  Since the new rectangle is proportional to the original, its length-to-width ratio is also $\frac{3}{5}$.  If the new rectangle has a length of $9$ inches, we can use this ratio to find its width: \begin{align*}
\frac{\text{width}}{9\text{ in}}&=\frac{3}{5}\\

Extracting Answer from: 
Each full rotation of the minute hand on a clock produces a $360^\circ$ change in the angle formed by the hour and minute hands.  Each full rotation of the hour hand produces a $30^\circ$ change in the angle formed by the hands.  Since there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour mark is $360^\circ/12=30^\circ$ from the previous one.  Thus at 4:00, the minute hand is at $12$ while the hour hand is at $4\times 30^\circ = 120^\circ$.  Since 20 minutes is $\frac{20}{60}=\frac13$ of a full rotation, the minute hand has moved $\frac13 \times 360^\circ=120^\circ$ from the $12$.  So at 4:20, the minute hand is at $12+120^\circ=300^\circ$.  The hour hand has moved $\frac13\times 30^\circ=10^\circ$ from the $4$ mark, so at 4:20 the hour hand is at $130^\circ.$  The angle between the hands is now $300^\circ-130^\circ=\boxed{170^\circ}.$

The largest multiple of 6 whose square is less than 200 is $6\cdot 6 = 36$. The negative multiples of 6 give the same squares as their positive counterparts, so we can restrict ourselves to considering positive multiples of 6. Since $8\cdot 8 = 64 > 36$, the positive multiples of 6 less than 8 don't work.  But since $10\cdot 10 = 100>36$, the positive multiples of 6 less than 10 work.  Since $12\cdot 12 = 144>36$, the multiples of 6 less than 12 work.  But since $14\cdot 14 = 196>200$, the multiples of 6 less than 14 don't work.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the percentage of people in Mathopolis who are children be $x$. The percentage of adults is then $1-x$. Half the adults are female, and half the females have exactly one child, so the percentage of people who are females with a child is $\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. This percentage is equal to the percentage of children, since there is a correspondence between a mother and a child. So we have the equation $x=\frac{1}{4}(1-x)$. Solving for $x$ yields $x=1/5$, or $\boxed{20}$ percent.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $A$ be the number of adult females and $C$ be the number of children. Then we know that:

- The number of adult males is the same as the number of adult females.
- The total number of adults is $2A$, since there are an equal number of adult males and females.
- The number of adult females with a child is $A/2$.
- The total number of people in Mathopolis is $2A + C$.

Since nobody else has a child, the total number of children must be equal to the number of female adults with a child. Therefore, we have:

$$C = \frac{A}{2}$$

Substituting this into the expression for the total number of people, we get:

$$\text{Total number of people} = 2A + \frac{A}{2} = \frac{5}{2}A$$

Since exactly half of the adults are female, we have:

$$A = \frac{1}{2}(2A) = \frac{1}{2}(\text{Total number of adults})$$

Substituting this into the expression for the total number of people, we get:

$$\text{Total number of people} = \frac{5}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}(\text{Total number of adults}) = \frac{5}{4}(\text{Total number of adults})$$

Let $T$ be the total number of people in Mathopolis. Then we have:

$$T = \frac{5}{4}(\text{Total number of adults})$$

Since adults are defined as people 21 years of age or older, the number of children is equal to the total number of people minus the number of adults:

$$C = T - (2A)$$

Substituting for $T$ and $A$ using the equations above, we get:

$$C = \frac{5}{4}(\text{Total number of adults}) - 2\cdot\frac{1}{2}(\text{Total number of adults}) = \frac{1}{2}(\text{Total number of adults})$$

Since the number of adults is twice the number of adult females, we have:

$$\text{Total number of adults} = 2A = 4(\text{Number of adult females})$$

Substituting this into the expression for the number of children, we get:

$$C = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 4(\text{Number of adult females}) = 2(\text{Number of adult females})$$

Therefore, the ratio of children to the total number of people is:

$$\frac{C}{T} = \frac{2(\text{Number of adult females})}{\frac{5}{4}(\text{Total number of adults})} = \frac{8}{5}\cdot\frac{\text{Number of adult females}}{\text{Total number of adults}} $$

Since exactly half of the adults are female, we have:

$$\frac{\text{Number of adult females}}{\text{Total number of adults}} = \frac{1}{2}$$

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

$$\frac{C}{T} = \frac{8}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \boxed{80\%}$$

Therefore, 80% of the people of Mathopolis are children.

Extracting Answer from: 
We draw segments $\overline{BE}$ and $\overline{CD}$. Then, $\overline{BE}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$ since $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{CD}$ . Hence, since $\triangle ABE$ is right-angled at $E$, we use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $AE$ as follows: $$AE = \sqrt{AB^2 - BE^2} = \sqrt{50^2 - 30^2} = 40.$$ Likewise, we find $DE = 18$, and we find that $\overline{DE}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{CD}$, so $\triangle ACD$ is isoceles. Hence, $AC = 50$. The perimeter of the trapezoid is $$AB + BC + CD + AD = BE + 2\cdot AE + BC + CD + DE.$$ Substituting, we find this equals $$(50\text{ (since $\triangle ACD$ isoceles)}) + 2(40) + 24 + 68 + 18 = \boxed{240}.$$

Recall that $\left(a^m\right)^n=a^{mn}$. Because of this, the second number is $\left(2^2\right)^3=2^{2\cdot 3}=2^6$. Because the exponents in the first number are in parentheses, we must complete that exponentiation first. $2^3=8$, so the first number is $2^{(2^3)}=2^8$. Thus, we have  \[2^8-2^6.\] Evaluating these exponents and subtracting, we get $256-64=\boxed{192}$.

We can compare numbers in decimal form digit-by-digit, starting with the largest digit. The ones digits of the four numbers are  \begin{tabular}{cc}
number & ones digit \\ \hline
0.78 & 0 \\
0.12 & 0 \\
1.33 & 1 \\
1.328 & 1
\end{tabular}Since $1$ is bigger than $0,$ this tells us that each of the first two numbers is smaller than each of the second two numbers. Continuing to compare $1.33$ and $1.328,$ we go to the next digit. The tenths digit of each number is $3,$ so we have to go to the next digit. The hundredths digit of $1.33$ is $3,$ while the hundredths digit of $1.328$ is $2.$ Since $3$ is bigger than $2,$ we conclude that $1.33$ is bigger than $1.328.$

Comparing the two numbers that are less than $1,$ we see that the tenths digit of $0.12$ is smaller than the tenths digit of $0.78.$ So, $0.12$ is the smallest of these four numbers.

Since the pieces must either be in the same row or column, we consider two cases.

Case 1: The pieces are in the same row. There are $8$ rows, and we can pick any row. Once we pick a row, there are $\binom{8}{2}$ ways to choose two squares in that row for the pieces to occupy. Therefore, there are $8 \cdot \binom{8}{2} = 8 \cdot 28 = 224$ ways to place the two pieces in the same row.

Case 2: The pieces are in the same column. This is analogous to Case 1, so there are again $224$ ways in this case.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the two pieces such that they are in the same row or column is $224 + 224 = \boxed{448}$.

If the measure of $\angle TSQ$ is $145^{\circ}$, then the measure of $\angle TSP$ is $180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^{\circ}$ since they are supplementary angles. The measure of $\angle RQP$ is also $35^{\circ}$ since sides $TS$ and $RQ$ are parallel. Now we have two of the three angles in triangle $PQR$. To find the third, we calculate $180^{\circ} - 65^{\circ} - 35^{\circ} = 80^{\circ}$. The measure of $\angle PRQ$ is $\boxed{80^{\circ}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\angle TSQ = 145^\circ$, we have $\angle PSQ + \angle QST = 145^\circ$. But since $TS \parallel RQ$, we have $\angle PSQ = \angle PQR$, so $\angle PQR + \angle QST = 145^\circ$.

Now consider triangle $PQT$. We have $\angle QPT = \angle RPQ = 65^\circ$ and $\angle QTP = \angle STQ$, so $\angle PQT = 180^\circ - 65^\circ - 145^\circ = 70^\circ$.

Finally, in triangle $PQR$, we have $\angle PRQ = 180^\circ - \angle PQR - \angle QRP = 180^\circ - 65^\circ - \angle PQT = \boxed{45^\circ}$.

Let the number of red 4-door cars be $x$.  Since $\frac13$ of the cars are red, there are $\frac13\cdot 30 = 10$ red cars, so there are $10 -x$ red 2-door cars.  There are $(50\%)\cdot 30 = (0.5)(30) = 15$ cars that are 4-door cars, so $15-x$ of the 4-door cars are not red.  We then have the following Venn diagram:

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $r$ be the number of red cars and $w$ be the number of white cars. Then we know that $r+w=30$ and $\frac{r}{r+w}=\frac{1}{3}$, which implies $r=10$. 

Let $d_2$ be the number of 2-door cars and $d_4$ be the number of 4-door cars. We know that $d_2+w=30-r$ and $\frac{d_4}{d_2+d_4}=0.5$, which implies $d_4=d_2$. 

We are given that 8 of the 2-door cars are white, so $d_2=8+w$. Combining all of these equations, we get: $$d_4=d_2=8+w$$ $$d_4+d_2=2d_4+8+w=2(8+w)+8=24+2w$$ $$d_4=0.5(24+2w)=12+w$$

We want to find the number of cars that are both 4-door and red, which is the intersection of the 4-door cars and the red cars. Let $x$ be the number of cars that are both 4-door and red. Then we have: $$x=\frac{d_4}{d_2+d_4}\cdot\frac{r}{r+w}=\frac{12+w}{24+2w}\cdot\frac{10}{30-w}=\frac{5}{9}$$

Therefore, $\frac{5}{9}$ of the cars that are either red or white and have 4 doors are both red and 4-door. There are $d_4=12+w$ cars with 4 doors in total, so the number of 4-door and red cars is $\frac{5}{9}\cdot (12+w)=\frac{5}{9}\cdot (12+r-w)=\frac{5}{9}\cdot (12+10-w)=\boxed{9}$.

The product of four positive integers is prime only if three of the integers are 1 and the fourth is a prime number.  Therefore, of the $6^4$ outcomes for the roll of four dice, only the outcomes $(1,1,1,p)$, $(1,1,p,1)$, $(1,p,1,1)$, and $(p,1,1,1)$ for $p=2$, $3$, or $5$ give a prime product.  The probability of achieving a prime product is therefore \[

Extracting Answer from: 
The product of the numbers on the top faces will be prime if and only if exactly one of the dice shows a 2 and the others show odd numbers, or all of the dice show odd numbers. The probability of the first case is $\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{48},$ since the first die may roll a 2 or a number from 1 to 6 with equal probability, while each of the other dice has a 1/2 chance of rolling an odd number. The probability of the second case is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4=\frac{1}{16},$ since each of the dice has a 50/50 chance of rolling an odd number.
Thus, the total probability is $\frac{1}{48}+\frac{1}{16}=\frac{1}{12},$ so the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}.$

First, we can simplify $\frac{3a^2b}{5ac}$ by canceling a factor of $a$ and $c$, so we have $\frac{3ab}{5}$. Next, we can simplify $\frac{10c}{6ab}$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ to get $\frac{5c}{3ab}$. Multiplying these two simplified fractions, we have $$\frac{3ab}{5}\times\frac{5c}{3ab}=\boxed{c}.$$

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DB=DC = DA = 4\sqrt{2}$, so $BC = BD+DC = 8\sqrt{2}$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(4\sqrt{2})(8\sqrt{2})}{2} = \boxed{32}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the length of each leg of the triangle.  Then the hypotenuse has length $x\sqrt{2}$, and the area of the triangle is \[
\frac{1}{2}(x)(x)=\frac{1}{2}x^2.
\]The altitude to the hypotenuse divides the right triangle into two smaller triangles, each similar to the original triangle.  The ratio of the sides of these two similar triangles is  \[
\frac{\text{(altitude)}}{\text{(leg)}}=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{x}.
\]Since the ratio of corresponding sides of similar figures is constant, the ratio of the areas of the two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus \[
\frac{\text{(area of shaded triangle)}}{\text{(area of entire triangle)}}=\left(\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{x}\right)^2=\frac{32}{x^2}.
\]The area of the shaded triangle is the difference between the areas of the entire triangle and the two similar triangles, or \[
\frac{1}{2}x^2-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2=\frac{1}{2}(x^2-2x^2)=\frac{1}{2}(-x^2)=-\frac{1}{2}x^2.
\]Thus \[
\frac{\text{(area of shaded triangle)}}{\text{(area of entire triangle)}}=\frac{-\frac{1}{2}x^2}{\frac{1}{2}x^2}=-1,
\]so the area of the shaded triangle is $-\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  Since the area of a triangle must be positive, we take the absolute value of this result, which we find to be $\boxed{8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that $\frac{63}{5}$ is an improper fraction because the numerator is bigger than the denominator. To convert it to a mixed number, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator and see how many whole times the denominator goes into it.

$$\frac{63}{5} = 12\frac{3}{5}$$

So $\frac{63}{5}$ is equal to $12$ whole units and a fraction of $\frac{3}{5}$. Therefore, the mixed number representation of $\frac{63}{5}$ is $12\frac{3}{5}$.

The area of the given region is equal to the sum of the areas of the two rectangles. The smaller rectangle on the right has dimensions $2$ yards by $5$ yards, so it has area $2 \cdot 5 = 10$ square yards. The larger rectangle on the left has dimensions $4$ yards by $3$ yards, so it has area $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ square yards. The total area that needs to be covered is $10 + 12 = 22$ square yards.

To cover this area, we need $22$ square yards of padding, and $22$ square yards of carpet. The cost of the padding is $22 \cdot \$2.55 = \$56.10$, and the cost of the carpet is $22 \cdot \$21.95 = \$482.90$.

We now look at quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose interior angle measures must sum to $360^\circ$. Therefore, we have that $110^\circ +100^\circ +3y+3x=360^\circ$, so $3x+3y=150^\circ$. We want to find $2x+2y$, so we multiply both sides of the equation by $2/3$ to get that $2x+2y=100^\circ$. We can now substitute in $100^\circ$ for $2x+2y$ to find that the measure of angle $AFD$ is $180-(2x+2y)=180-100=\boxed{80}$ degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\angle BAD$ is trisected and $\angle BAC = 110^\circ$, we have $\angle DAE = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 110^\circ = 36^\circ$ and $\angle BAD = 3 \cdot 36^\circ = 108^\circ$. Similarly, we find that $\angle CDF = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 100^\circ = 33.\overline{3}^\circ$ and $\angle ADC = 3 \cdot 33.\overline{3}^\circ = 100^\circ$. 

Since quadrilateral $ABCD$ has a sum of angles of $360^\circ$, we can solve for $\angle ABC$ and $\angle BCD$ as follows: \begin{align*}
\angle ABC + \angle BCD &= 360^\circ - \angle BAD - \angle ADC \\
\angle ABC + \angle BCD &= 360^\circ - 108^\circ - 100^\circ \\
\angle ABC + \angle BCD &= 152^\circ.
\end{align*} 

Since $\angle BCD = \angle ACE$, we know that $\angle ACF = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ$. Thus, \[\angle ACF + \angle FCE + \angle FCD = 180^\circ,\] which means that \[\angle FCE + 33.\overline{3}^\circ = 110^\circ.\] Therefore, $\angle FCE = 76.\overline{6}^\circ$. 

Finally, we have \[\angle AFD = \angle CFE = 180^\circ - \angle CEF - \angle FCE = 180^\circ - 36^\circ - 76.\overline{6}^\circ = \boxed{67.\overline{3}^\circ}.\]

Recall that if $b$ and $d$ are nonzero, then  $$\frac{a}{b}\cdot \frac{c}{d}=\frac{a\cdot c}{b\cdot d}.$$That is, to multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.  The product of the given numerators is $-5\cdot 8=-40$.  The product of the denominators is $9\cdot 17=153$.  So,  $$\frac{-5}{9}\cdot \frac{8}{17}=\frac{-5\cdot 8}{9\cdot 17}=\frac{-40}{153}=\boxed{-\frac{40}{153}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We have  \[\frac{-5}{9}\cdot\frac{8}{17}=\frac{(-5)(8)}{(9)(17)}.\] Since $\gcd(5,9)=1$ and $\gcd(8,17)=1$, the numerator and the denominator are now as reduced as possible. Multiplying, we get \[\frac{(-5)(8)}{(9)(17)}=\frac{-40}{153}.\] (Note that either the numerator or the denominator could be negative, but not both.)  Therefore, $\frac{-5}{9}\cdot\frac{8}{17}=\boxed{\frac{-40}{153}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First we need to find out how many cookies are in one dozen: 

20 dozen = 20 x 12 = 240 cookies

Next, we can use a proportion to find out how many cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies: 

15 cups flour / 240 cookies = x cups flour / 144 cookies 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

240x = 15 cups flour x 144 cookies 

240x = 2160 

x = 9 

Therefore, 9 cups of flour are needed for 144 cookies.

Since $100 = 50\cdot 2$, there are 50 integers in the set that are divisible by 2.  The numbers among these that are also divisible by 3 are the multiples of 6 in the set.

The numbers on the diagonal must consist of 5 out of the 24 remaining numbers once we remove the middle number. There are $\binom{24}{5}=42,\!504$ ways to choose these numbers. However, order matters because the numbers are placed in a specific diagonal. First, there are 2 choices for which of the two halves of the diagonal the WILD square should be in. Next, the smaller half of the diagonal must contain 2 of the 4 numbers from the set $31-45$, and there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways for the numbers to be chosen in that half of the diagonal. The larger half of the diagonal must contain 2 of the 5 numbers from the set $46-60$ and one of the 5 numbers from the set $61-75$, which can be done in $5\cdot\binom{5}{2} = 50$ ways.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the number we're looking for "x". 

"Ten more than five times a number" can be written as 5x + 10. 

"Equals" means that the expression on the left side of the equation has the same value as the expression on the right side of the equation. 

"Five more than ten times the number" can be written as 10x + 5. 

Putting it all together: 

5x + 10 = 10x + 5 

Now we can solve for x: 

Subtracting 5x from both sides: 

10 = 5x + 5 

Subtracting 5 from both sides: 

5 = 5x 

Dividing both sides by 5: 

x = 1 

Therefore, the number we're looking for is x = 1.

Let the number of pennies that Betty has be $n.$ If after adding two more pennies, Betty can only arrange the pennies in a straight line, then $n+2$ must be prime. Since all primes greater than $2$ are odd, $n$ must be odd as well. Because she can arrange $n$ pennies in three different ways, $n$ must have four factors other than $1$ and itself. Hence we examine the odd numbers between $40$ and $50:$

$\bullet$ $41$ factors as $1 \cdot 41$ only.

$\bullet$ $43$ factors as $1 \cdot 43$ only.

$\bullet$ $45$ factors as $1 \cdot 45$ or $3 \cdot 15$ or $5 \cdot 9$.

$\bullet$ $47$ factors as $1 \cdot 47$ only.

$\bullet$ $49$ factors as $1 \cdot 49$ or $7 \cdot 7$.

The only number with four factors other than $1$ or itself is $45.$ If we add $2$ to $45,$ we get $47,$ which is indeed prime. Hence, Betty has $\boxed{45}$ pennies.

Let $a$ and $b$ be the dimensions of the rectangular array of pennies. Then, the number of pennies is $ab$, and we want to find $ab$.

If Betty can arrange the pennies in three different rectangles without any gaps, then we know that $ab$ has three different pairs of factors. Since $ab$ is between $40$ and $50$, the only such value is $ab=6\cdot 10=60$.

If Betty adds two pennies to her collection, the only way to arrange them without any gaps or spaces is in a straight line. Thus, Betty originally had $60-2=\boxed{58}$ pennies.

First, we simplify the left side.  We have  \[3p-2(p-4) = 3p - 2p + 8 = p + 8,\] so we can write the original equation as $p+8 = 7p + 6$.  Subtracting $p$ from both sides gives $8=6p+6$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2 = 6p$.  Finally, dividing by 6 gives $p = 2/6 = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

We distribute the negative sign in $-2(p-4)$ to get $-2p + 8$. Substituting that into the original equation gives $3p - 2p + 8 = 7p + 6$, which simplifies to $p+8=7p+6$. Subtracting $p$ from both sides gives $8=6p + 6$, then subtracting $6$ from both sides gives $2=6p$. Finally, dividing both sides by $6$ gives $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}=p$.

We can start by converting 0.30 hours to minutes. To do this, we can multiply 0.30 by 60, since there are 60 minutes in one hour:

0.30 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 18 minutes

So Michael takes 18 minutes to walk to school. Now we can convert this to seconds by multiplying by 60 again:

18 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 1080 seconds

Therefore, it takes Michael 1080 seconds to walk to school.

The two smallest prime numbers are 2 and 3, and $2+3=5$ is also prime. Therefore, $\boxed{5}$ is the smallest prime number that is the sum of two other distinct primes.

Note: If $p$ and $q$ are odd primes, then $p+q$ is an even number greater than 7 and is therefore composite.  So the only sets of three primes for which two primes sum to the third are of the form $\{2,p,p+2\}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1679_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by listing out the first few prime numbers:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ...

We can then try adding pairs of these primes together until we find a sum that is also prime. We notice that adding two even primes (2 and another even prime) will always give an even number, which is not prime. So we can skip checking pairs that include 2.

Next, we notice that adding any prime number to 2 will give an odd number, and the only even prime number is 2. Therefore, we can skip checking any pairs that include 2.

We can also skip pairs that include 3, since the sum of any two primes greater than 2 that includes 3 will be a multiple of 3 (which is not prime).

Using these observations, we can start checking pairs of primes:

5 + 7 = 12 (not prime)
5 + 11 = 16 (not prime)
5 + 13 = 18 (not prime)
5 + 17 = 22 (not prime)
5 + 19 = 24 (not prime)
5 + 23 = 28 (not prime)
7 + 11 = 18 (not prime)
7 + 13 = 20 (not prime)
7 + 17 = 24 (not prime)
7 + 19 = 26 (not prime)
7 + 23 = 30 (not prime)
11 + 13 = 24 (not prime)
11 + 17 = 28 (not prime)
11 + 19 = 30 (not prime)
13 + 17 = 30 (not prime)
13 + 19 = 32 (not prime)
17 + 19 = 36 (not prime)

We can stop here, because the next pair of primes includes 23, which we have already added to other primes. Therefore, the smallest prime that is the sum of two other distinct prime numbers is $\boxed{29}$, which is the sum of 2 and 27.

Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $144^\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $144n$.  Therefore, we must have  \[180(n-2) = 144n.\]Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 144n$, so $36n = 360$ and $n = \boxed{10}$.

We might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\circ - 144^\circ = 36^\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\circ$, so there must be $\frac{360^\circ}{36^\circ} = 10$ of them in the polygon.

We will find the positive divisors of 14 by finding pairs that multiply to 14.   We begin our list as follows, $$1 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 14.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\cdot 7=14$, so our list becomes $$1 \quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 7 \quad 14.$$  Checking $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$, we find that none of these are divisors of $14$, so our final list is $$1 \quad 2 \quad 7 \quad 14.$$  Next, we use the buddy method to determine the factors of $42$.  We begin our list as follows, $$1\quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 42.$$  Checking $2$, we find that $2\cdot 21=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Checking $3$, we find that $3\cdot 14=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Checking $4$ and $5$ we find that $4$ and $5$ are not divisors of $42$.  Checking $6$, we find that $6\cdot 7=42$, so our list becomes $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 6 \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad \dots \quad \underline{\hphantom{10}} \quad 7 \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  Since $7$ is already on our list, our final list is $$1\quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 6 \quad 7 \quad 14 \quad 21 \quad 42.$$  We compare our lists for the factors of $14$ and the factors of $42$ to see that the factors that $14$ and $42$ share are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $14$.  Therefore, Rick and Steve could be thinking of $\boxed{4}$ possible numbers.  Note that since $14$ is a factor of $42$, all of the factors of $14$ are also factors of $42$.

The trick to convert repeating decimals to fractions always involves recognizing the pattern of the repeating decimal and using it to your advantage. In this case, we can recognize that multiplying $1.\overline{234}$ by $1000$ gives $1234.\overline{234}$, a decimal with the exact same repeating portion. Thus, \[
(1000-1) \cdot 1.\overline{234} = 1000 \cdot 1.\overline{234} - 1.\overline{234} = 1234.\overline{234} - 1.\overline{234}
\]\[
\Rightarrow 999 \cdot 1.\overline{234} = 1233
\]\[
\Rightarrow 1.\overline{234} = \frac{1233}{999} = \frac{137 \cdot 9}{111 \cdot 9} = \boxed{\frac{137}{111}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the lowest possible score that Alicia could have earned on one of the five tests. 

Since Alicia's average on the five tests is 88, we know that the sum of her scores on the five tests must be $5\times 88 = 440$. 

If Alicia earned the lowest possible score of $x$ on one of the tests, then the sum of her scores on the other four tests must be at least $(4\times 100) + x$. This is because the score range for each test is 0 to 100 points, so Alicia could have earned a perfect score of 100 on each of the other four tests. 

Putting everything together, we get the inequality: 

$$x + (4\times 100) \leq 440$$

Simplifying, we have:

$$x + 400 \leq 440$$

Subtracting 400 from both sides, we get:

$$x \leq 40$$

Therefore, the lowest possible score that Alicia could have earned on one of the five tests is $\boxed{40}$.

First, we prime factorize each number: $$9 = 3^2,$$ $$12 = 2^2 \cdot 3,$$ $$15 = 3 \cdot 5.$$ We need to take the maximum exponent for each prime factor. Since $2$ appears only in $12$, and only with exponent $2$, we need to include it with exponent $2$. This gives us

$$\text{LCM}(9, 12, 15) = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 = \boxed{180}.$$ Therefore, Rachel, Jessica, and Richard will report to the principal on the same day in $180$ days.

Answer from Original: 27

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1715_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can begin the problem by using a system of equations. Let's call the number of dresses "d" and the number of shirts "s". We can write:

d + s = 72    (the factory produced 72 garments in total)
d = 3/5s     (the ratio of dresses to shirts is 3:5)

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate the "d" variable:

(3/5s) + s = 72

Simplifying this equation:

8/5s = 72

Multiplying both sides by 5/8:

s = 45

So the factory produced 45 shirts. To find the number of dresses, we can substitute this value into either equation:

d + 45 = 72

d = 27

Therefore, the factory produced 27 dresses.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1718_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can start the problem by using the formula:

rate = amount of work ÷ time

where the "rate" refers to the amount of hay eaten per hour, the "amount of work" refers to the total amount of hay eaten, and the "time" refers to the number of hours it takes to eat that amount of hay.

Let's first find the rate at which each horse eats:

rate per horse = 12 bales ÷ 6 horses ÷ 12 hours = 0.1667 bales per horse per hour

So each horse eats 0.1667 bales of hay per hour. Now let's find the total rate for 12 horses:

total rate for 12 horses = rate per horse × number of horses = 0.1667 bales per horse per hour × 12 horses = 2 bales per hour

So 12 horses together eat 2 bales of hay per hour. Now we can use this rate to find the time it takes to eat 36 bales:

time = amount of work ÷ rate = 36 bales ÷ 2 bales per hour = 18 hours

Therefore, 36 bales of hay will last 12 horses for 18 hours.

We can count the total number of handshakes by counting the lawyers shaking hands with each of the politicians and then the politicians shaking hands among themselves.

If each lawyer shakes hands with each of the politicians, then each lawyer shakes hands with four people. Since there are three lawyers, $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ handshakes occur.

If each politician shakes hands with each of the other politicians, the first shakes hands with three others, the second shakes hands with two others (not counting the handshake with the first that has already transpired), and the last two each shake the hand of the other. Thus, there are $3 + 2 + 1 = 6$ handshakes that occur.

So, $12 + 6 = \boxed{18}$ total handshakes take place.

First, we would like to determine if 49 can be written as the sum of two perfect squares.

$49 - 1 = 48$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 4 = 45$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 9 = 40$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 16 = 33$, which is not a perfect square.

$49 - 25 = 24$, which is not a perfect square.

We don't need to check any other squares, as $25 > \frac{49}{2}$.

Now, we check to see if there are three perfect squares that sum to 49. With a little work, we see that $49 = 4 + 9 + 36$. Thus, the fewest number of perfect square terms that can be added together to sum to 49 is $\boxed{3}$.

It is not possible to use fewer than 5 terms. We can see this by considering the largest possible square in the sum. The largest perfect square smaller than 49 is 36. If we use 36, then we are left with a remainder of 13. The only way to express 13 as the sum of perfect squares is $9+4$, so we need at least 2 more squares, giving us a total of at least 3 squares. However, if we try to use two squares smaller than 36 to add up to 13, the sum will be at most $6+4=10$, which is too small. Therefore, we must use at least 3 squares, and it is easy to see that we can use 3 squares to add up to 49: $36+9+4$. Therefore, the fewest possible number of perfect square terms is $\boxed{3}$.

We want to find the largest of these integers, which is $n+1$. Multiplying out the left side of the first equation gives $n^3-n=120$, or $n^3-n-120=0$. Factoring the left side gives $(n-5)(n+4)(n+3)=0$. Since $n$ must be an integer, the possible values for $n$ are $-4$, $-3,$ and $5$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The key to this problem is to realize that a number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. This is because the divisors of a number come in pairs: if $d$ is a divisor of $n$, then $\frac{n}{d}$ is also a divisor of $n$. The only time this doesn't happen is when $d=\sqrt{n}$, and in that case, we have only one divisor ($\sqrt{n}$) instead of a pair.

So, we need to count the number of perfect squares less than 103. The largest perfect square less than 103 is $10^2=100$, and the smallest perfect square greater than 103 is $11^2=121$. Therefore, there are 10 perfect squares less than 103:

$$1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100$$

Each of these has an odd number of divisors, so there are $\boxed{10}$ positive integers less than 103 with an odd number of positive divisors.

Because every term before the subtraction sign is added, and addition is associative (parentheses don't matter) placing parentheses on them will not change their value. However, subtraction is not associative. Since we are trying to minimize this expression's value, we want to subtract as much as possible. The expression is thus minimized when parentheses are placed in the following location: $1+2+3-(4+5+6)$. This simplifies to $1+2+3-15 = 6-15=\boxed{-9}$.

Answer from Original: 17meters

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1734_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To find out how far Stacey is from her starting point, we need to add up the north-south and east-west distances separately.

First, we look at the north-south distances. Stacey walked 30 meters north and then 22 meters south. We can subtract the smaller distance from the larger to find the net north-south distance:

30 m - 22 m = 8 m north

So Stacey is 8 meters north of her starting point.

Next, we look at the east-west distances. Stacey walked 11 meters west and then 4 meters west. We can add those distances to find the net east-west distance:

11 m + 4 m = 15 m west

So Stacey is 15 meters west of her starting point.

To find the total distance from her starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 8 meters and 15 meters:

c^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
c^2 = 64 + 225
c^2 = 289
c = 17

So Stacey is 17 meters from her starting point.

Let the radius of the smallest circle be $r$. Then, the area of the smallest circle is $\pi r^2$, and the area of the ring between the two largest circles is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle, which is $\pi(13^2-12^2)$. Setting these two areas equal, we get \[\pi r^2=\pi(13^2-12^2).\] Simplifying this gives $r^2=25$, so $r=\boxed{5}$.

Because the number goes to the ten-thousandths place, and that is where Irene rounds to, Irene will end up with the given number. Since we are looking for the largest number in the group, anyone who ends up rounding down is not the winner because Irene has a number greater than them. Thus, we can ignore all people who end up rounding down.

When we round a number, we look to the digit to the right. If the digit is less than 5, we round down. Thus, if we round by looking at the 2, 3, or 4, we will round down. Thus, Alice, Bob, and Carol will round down, so they are not the winner. Devon will round to the nearest ten. Because 5.6789 is greater than 5, Devon will round up to 12350.

When we round up, the most we can increase the number by is by increasing the decimal place we are rounding to by 1. For example, if we are rounding to the tenths place, the most change that the tenths place can undergo is increasing by 1. We cannot increase it by 2 through rounding. Thus, when Eugene rounds to the nearest one, the highest the ones place could be is a 6, and the tens place will still be a 4. Thus, Eugene's number is smaller than Devon's. Likewise, all of the other people will round their numbers up by less than Devon has, so $\boxed{\text{Devon}}$ is the winner.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $p$ be a two-digit prime with digits $a$ and $b$, so we have $p = 10a + b$. If $a+b=8$, then $p = 10a + (8-a) = 8 + 9a$, so $9a = p-8$. Since $p$ is a prime and $10 \leq p \leq 97$, we have $2 \leq a \leq 10$. Thus $9a$ is divisible by 9, so $p-8$ is divisible by 9, which means that the digits of $p$ sum to a multiple of 9. The only two-digit prime whose digits sum to a multiple of 9 but is not divisible by 3 is 89, but the digits of 89 do not sum to 8. Therefore, there are $\boxed{0}$ two-digit primes whose digits sum to 8.

Let$p$beatwo-digitprimewithdigits$a$and$b$,sowehave$p=10a+b$.If$a+b=8$,then$p=10a+(8-a)=8+9a$,so$9a=p-8$.Since$p$isaprimeand$10\leqp\leq97$,wehave$2\leqa\leq10$.Thus$9a$isdivisibleby9,so$p-8$isdivisibleby9,whichmeansthatthedigitsof$p$sumtoamultipleof9.Theonlytwo-digitprimewhosedigitssumtoamultipleof9butisnotdivisibleby3is89,butthedigitsof89donotsumto8.Therefore,thereare$\boxed{0}$two-digitprimeswhosedigitssumto8.

Answer from Original: 150

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1754_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can begin by using the formula:

rate = work / time

where "rate" is the amount of work done per unit of time (in this case, the number of memos typed per day), "work" is the total amount of work done (in this case, the number of memos typed), and "time" is the duration of time over which the work is done (in this case, the number of days).

Let's use subscripts to represent the different groups of typists and the different durations of time. Specifically, let T4 represent the group of four typists, T3 represent the group of three typists, and let D3 represent the duration of three days. Then we can write:

rate[T4,D3] = work[T4,D3] / time[D3]

where the work done by T4 in D3 is 600 memos.

To find the rate at which T3 can type memos in one day, we can use the same formula with T3 and a duration of one day (D1), and solve for the work:

work[T3,D1] = rate[T3,D1] * time[D1]

where the time is now one day. We want to find the rate, so we can rearrange the equation:

rate[T3,D1] = work[T3,D1] / time[D1]

Now we need to find the work done by T3 in one day. We can start by noting that if four typists can type 600 memos in three days, then one typist can type 600/4 = 150 memos in three days. Therefore, the work done by T4 in three days is:

work[T4,D3] = 4 * 150 * 3 = 1800 memos

Now we need to use proportional reasoning to find the work done by T3 in one day, based on the work done by T4 in one day. Since T3 has three typists instead of four, we can expect their work rate to be three-fourths as much as T4's work rate. Similarly, since we want to find the work done in one day instead of three days, we can expect their work to be one-third as much as T4's work. Therefore:

work[T3,D1] = (3/4) * (1/3) * work[T4,D3] = 450 memos

Finally, we can plug this value into the formula for the rate:

rate[T3,D1] = work[T3,D1] / time[D1] = 450 / 1 = 450 memos/day

Therefore, three typists can type 450 memos in one day.

To make $\$17$, we can use anywhere from $0$ to $8$ $\$5$ bills. We can then make up the rest of the total with $\$2$ bills.

Convert both decimals into fractions. \begin{align*}

\Rightarrow 10x&=2.\overline{2} \\
\Rightarrow 9x&=2 \\
\Rightarrow x &= \frac{2}{9}.
\end{align*}Likewise, $.\overline{6}=\frac{6}{9}$. Adding the two fractions yields $\frac{2}{9} + \frac{6}{9}=\frac{8}{9}$. The reciprocal of this is $\frac{1}{\frac{8}{9}}=\frac{9}{8}$. To convert this to a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 125. Doing so, we get \[\frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{125}{125} = \frac{9 \cdot 125}{8 \cdot 125} = \frac{1125}{1000}=\boxed{1.125}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let x be the smaller number and y be the larger number. 

From the first sentence, we know that: 

x + y = 15 

From the second sentence, we know that: 

4x = 2y - 60 

We can simplify the second equation: 

2x = y - 30 

Now we have two equations in two variables: 

x + y = 15 

2x - y = -30 

We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination: 

- Multiply the first equation by 2: 

2x + 2y = 30 

2x - y = -30 

- Add the equations: 

3x = 0 

- Solve for x: 

x = 0 

- Use x = 0 in either equation to find y: 

y = 15 

Therefore, the larger number is 15.

Let the trisectors of angles $B$ and $C$ intersect $BC$ and $AB$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively, and let $BP = PC = x$ and $BQ = QC = y$. Let $\theta = \angle BPC$. Because $BQ$ trisects angle $B$ and $QC = QB$, the measure of angle $B$ is $3 \theta$. Similarly, because $CD$ trisects $C$, the measure of angle $C$ is $3(180^\circ - \theta - 39^\circ)$. Therefore \[\frac x y = \frac {\sin (3\theta)}{\sin (3(180^\circ - \theta - 39^\circ))} = \frac{\sin(3\theta)}{\sin(3\theta+117^\circ)}.\] We also know that \[\frac{x}{y} = \frac{\sin(14^\circ)}{\sin(65^\circ)} = \frac{\sin(14^\circ)}{\sin(115^\circ)}.\] Equating the two, we have \[\frac{\sin(3\theta)}{\sin(3\theta+117^\circ)} = \frac{\sin(14^\circ)}{\sin(115^\circ)}.\] $3\theta + 117^\circ$ is a negative angle, so we can write \[\frac{\sin(3\theta)}{\sin(3\theta+117^\circ)} = \frac{\sin(-3\theta)}{\sin(-3\theta-117^\circ)}.\] Thus, because $\sin(-\theta) = -\sin\theta$, we have \[\frac{\sin (3\theta)}{\sin (3\theta+117^\circ)} = -\frac{\sin (3\theta)}{\sin (3\theta+117^\circ)},\] so $\sin (3\theta) = 0$, from which $\theta=\boxed{40}$.

We square both sides of the equation to get rid of the radical, giving $x-4 = 16$. Adding $4$ to both sides gives $x=20$. Checking our answer, we see that $\sqrt{20-4}=\sqrt{16}=4$, which is indeed true. Therefore, the solution is $x=\boxed{20}$.

There are $13$ cards that are odd numbers and $13$ $\spadesuit$ cards. However, we have double-counted the $\spadesuit$ odd-numbered cards, so we need to subtract them out. There are only $2$ of these: the $3\spadesuit$ and the $7\spadesuit$. Thus, there are $13 + 13 - 2 = 24$ cards that are either odd or $\spadesuit$ or both in the deck.

Right away we note that if a prime number begins with 2, then it is not an emirp because the number obtained by reversing its digit is even. Thus, we know 23 is not an emirp. Let's check the smaller two-digit primes: 11, 13, 17, 19. 11 is clearly an emirp. Since 31 and 71 are prime, 13 and 17 are emirps as well. $\boxed{19}$, however, is not an emirp since $91=7\cdot13$. Therefore, 19 is the smallest two-digit prime that is not an emirp.

We need to find a number from this list whose digits don't form a prime when reversed. We note that 19 and 61 are interchangeable (i.e. 19 written backwards is 91, which is the same as 61).

$\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{300} = \frac{25 \cdot 27}{3 \cdot 300}$.  Since $300 = 3 \cdot 100$, we can rewrite the expression as $\frac{25 \cdot 27}{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 100}$; then, we can combine $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ for the expression $\frac{25 \cdot 27}{100 \cdot 9}$.  Splitting this into the multiplication of two fractions yields $\frac{25}{100} \cdot \frac{27}{9}$, which can be simplified to $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{1} =$ $\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can simplify $\frac{25}{3}$ and $\frac{27}{300}$ by dividing both the numerator and denominator of each fraction by their greatest common factor. The greatest common factor of 25 and 3 is 1, and the greatest common factor of 27 and 300 is 3. So we get: $$\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{300} = \frac{25 \div 1}{3 \div 1} \cdot \frac{27 \div 3}{300 \div 3} = \frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{100}.$$To multiply two fractions, we multiply their numerators together and their denominators together. So we have: $$\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{100} = \frac{25 \cdot 9}{3 \cdot 100} = \frac{225}{300}.$$We can simplify $\frac{225}{300}$ by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 25: $$\frac{225}{300} = \frac{225 \div 25}{300 \div 25} = \frac{9}{12}.$$Finally, we can simplify $\frac{9}{12}$ by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, which is 3: $$\frac{9}{12} = \frac{9 \div 3}{12 \div 3} = \frac{3}{4}.$$So, we have: $$\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{300} = \frac{3}{4}.$$Therefore, $\frac{25}{3} \cdot \frac{27}{300} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the ratio of the speeds of the planes will be equal to the ratio of the distances that each travels.  Since the ratio of the speed of the faster plane to that of the slower one is $\frac{400}{250}$, the distance that the faster plane travels is $20,\!000 \times \frac{400}{250}=\boxed{32,\!000}$ feet.

Another way to do this problem is to use the formula Distance = Rate $\times$ Time. We would use this formula to find, using the information of the first plane, the exact amount of time it took to travel $20,\!000$ feet. Then using this new information we would again apply the formula, this time for the second plane, to find the answer.  This approach, however, is more complicated and requires conversion between units (feet to miles and vice versa).

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/1778_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
One way to solve the problem is to use the formula:

distance = rate $\times$ time

We know that the first plane traveled 20,000 feet at 250 miles per hour, so we can find the time it took:

distance = rate $\times$ time
$20,\!000$ feet = $\frac{250\text{ miles}}{1\text{ hour}} \times t$
$t = \frac{20,\!000\text{ feet}}{\frac{250\text{ miles}}{1\text{ hour}}}$
$t = \frac{20,\!000}{250}\text{ hours}$
$t = 80\text{ minutes}$

Therefore, both planes traveled for 80 minutes. Now we can find how far the second plane traveled:

distance = rate $\times$ time
distance = $400\text{ mph} \times 80\text{ minutes}$
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
distance = $400\text{ mph} \times \frac{80}{60}\text{ hours}$
distance = $400\text{ mph} \times \frac{4}{3}\text{ hours}$
distance = $533.\!33\text{ miles}$

To convert miles to feet, we multiply by 5,280:

distance = $533.\!33\text{ miles} \times 5,\!280\text{ feet/mile}$
distance $\approx 2,\!817,\!984\text{ feet}$

Therefore, the plane traveling at 400 miles per hour would travel approximately 2,817,984 feet in the same amount of time that the plane traveling at 250 miles per hour traveled 20,000 feet.

Extracting Answer from: 
If we can express this number as a single power of 10, then we can directly find the number of zeroes at the end of the numbers. Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it. We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\left( a^m \right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$. Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \begin{align*}
(10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div \left(10^{15}\right)^4 &= (10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\
&=(10^{5+77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\
&=(10^{82} \div 10^{15} )\div 10^{60} \\
&=10^{82-15} \div 10^{60} \\
&=10^{67} \div 10^{60} \\
&=10^{67-60} \\
&=10^7.
\end{align*}Because the exponent of the number 10 is 7, this number has $\boxed{7}$ zeroes at the end.

Extracting Answer from: 
When paper is folded, lengths of folds are equal. Let's say $PQ$ has a length of $x$. This means $PS$ has also a length of $x$. Since $PQ$ is folded onto $SR$, $SR$ has a length of $x$. This means $RQ$ is also equal to $x$. Therefore side length of $PQRS$ is equal to $x+x=2x$. When $PQ$ is folded onto $SR$, the figure becomes a rectangle with a base of $x$ and a height of $2x$. After folding $Q$ onto $S$, the figure becomes a triangle with a base of $x$ and a height of $x$. Therefore, using the area formulas for rectangles and triangles, we have $2x^2+x^2/2=9$. Solving for $x$ we see that $x^2=4$, so $x=2$, and $PQRS$ has a perimeter of $\boxed{8}$.

Let $n$ be the number of students in Jon's class. We know that $20\leq n\leq 28$ and that $n$ can be arranged into a rectangular grid with more than one row/column. Therefore, $n$ must be of the form $ab$, where $a>1$ and $b>1$ are integers.

Furthermore, since Jon can arrange the students into a single straight line, we know that $n$ is either a prime number or twice a prime number. We can quickly check that $n=20$, $24$, and $28$ are not of this form. However, $n=22=2\cdot 11$ is twice a prime number, so it is possible to arrange the students into a single straight line.

Therefore, Jon has $\boxed{22}$ students in his class.

It follows that $n\equiv 0 \pmod 3$. Hence the only possible values for $n$ are $0,3,6,9$. Therefore, the sum of all possible values for $n$ is $0+3+6+9=\boxed{18}$.

Since the pentagons are regular and are placed together at a vertex, the interior angles of the three pentagons add up to $180(3-2) = 180$. Thus, each of the interior angles measures $\frac{180}{3\cdot 5} = 12$ degrees. The angle in question is equal to $360 - 3\cdot 108 = 36$ degrees. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{36}$.

Let the first number be $n$. Then the next four consecutive numbers are $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$, and $n+4$. We are told that the sum of these numbers is 105, so we can write an equation:

\begin{align*}
n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) + (n+4) &= 105 \\
5n + 10 &= 105 \\
5n &= 95 \\

Therefore, the numbers are $19$, $20$, $21$, $22$, and $23$, and their mean is $(19+20+21+22+23)/5 = 21$. The median is also $21$.

Thus $$\frac{64}{7}\div\frac{8}{3}=\frac{64}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{8}.$$Then we can cancel out the common factor of 64 and 8 which is 8 and we arrive at $$\frac{64}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{8}=\frac{\cancel{8}\cdot8}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{\cancel{8}}.$$Finally, we multiply the remaining terms (make sure to multiply numerators by numerators and denominators by denominators) and we get $$\frac{\cancel{8}\cdot8}{7}\cdot\frac{3}{\cancel{8}}=\frac{3\cdot8}{7}=\boxed{\frac{24}{7}}.$$Note: 24 and 7 have no common denominators so we cannot simplify the fraction further.

The median of a set of values is a number with half of the values in the set greater than it and half of the values in the set less than it. If there are an even number of values in the set, then the median is the average of the two "middle" values. Since there are $8$ counties, the median number of students is the average of the number of students in the county with the $4^\text{th}$ most number of students and the number of students in the county with the $5^\text{th}$ most number of students. Looking at the chart, these two counties both have $29$ students, so the median number of students is $\boxed{29}$ students.

The interior angles of a quadrilateral must add up to 360.  (You can solve for this using the formula: $S = (n-2)(180)$, where S is the sum of the interior angles, and $n$ is the number of sides in the polygon.  However, if you want to get this problem quickly, you should have the value memorized.)  Since two of the angles are right, the other two angles must add up to 180.  Name the smaller angle $x$ - since the larger angle is double the smaller, we have $3x = 180 \rightarrow x = 60$, and $2x = 120$.  Thus, there are $\boxed{120}$ degrees in the larger angle.

We know that $d=2a$, and $b=c=90^\circ$ since they are both right angles. Also, the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is $360^\circ$, so we have: $$a+b+c+d=360^\circ$$ Substituting in our known values, we get: $$a+90^\circ+90^\circ+2a=360^\circ$$ Simplifying, we have: $$4a=180^\circ$$So, $a=45^\circ$. Therefore, the largest angle, $d$, is equal to $2a=2\cdot45^\circ=\boxed{90^\circ}$.

We can write $7!=7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1$. Since $\sqrt{ab}=\sqrt{a}\cdot\sqrt{b}$ for nonnegative real numbers $a$ and $b$, we have $$\sqrt{7!}=\sqrt{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}=\sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}.$$The expression inside the square root is simply $6!=6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1$, so $\sqrt{6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}=\sqrt{6!}$. We can use a similar method to obtain $\sqrt{6!}=\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}$, so $$\sqrt{7!} = \sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6!}=\sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1}.$$Again, the expression inside the square root is simply $5!$, so $\sqrt{5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}=\sqrt{5!}$. We can substitute to obtain $$\sqrt{7!} = \sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6!}=\sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{5!}= \sqrt{7}\cdot\sqrt{6}\cdot\sqrt{5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2\cdot 1}= \sqrt{7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}.$$Evaluate the expression inside the square root to obtain $$\sqrt{7!} = \sqrt{7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1} = \boxed{840}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by multiplying all parts of the inequality by the least common multiple of the denominators of the fractions.  In this case, that is 12. Working with the left side first, we have \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{4}&<\frac{x}{5}\\
\frac{12}{4}&< \frac{12x}{5}\\
3&<\frac{12x}{5}.
\end{align*}We can simplify the inequality on the right by dividing each side by 3, to get $\frac{4}{5}x<2$.  Multiplying through by 5 yields $4x<10$, so $x<\frac{5}{2}$.  Since $3<\frac{12x}{5}<8$, it follows that $x$ is an integer between $\frac{15}{12}=1\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{40}{12}=3\frac{1}{3}$.  The only integer in that range is 2, so there is only $\boxed{1}$ integer that satisfies the inequality.

Extracting Answer from: 
Recall that division is multiplication by a reciprocal. So we rewrite the division by $\frac{1}{93}$ as multiplication by the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{93}$. Since the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{93}$ is 93, we get  \[
\frac{1}{31} \div \frac{1}{93} = \frac{1}{31} \cdot 93.
\]Now we can use the commutative property of multiplication to turn this into a division problem:  \[
\frac{1}{31} \cdot 93 = 93 \cdot \frac{1}{31} = 93 \div 31 = \boxed{3}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by figuring out how much ground the elephant covers in a certain amount of time. We can use the formula:

distance = rate x time

If the elephant runs for t hours, then its distance d from the starting point is:

d = 19t

Now, let's do the same for the lion. If the lion runs for t hours in the opposite direction, then its distance from the starting point is:

d = 1 - 24t

Note that we are subtracting from 1 since the lion is running towards the elephant, which is at a distance of 1 mile.

Now, we want to find the time t it takes for the lion to catch up to the elephant, which means their distances are equal. So we can set the two distance expressions equal to each other:

19t = 1 - 24t

Solving for t, we get:

t = 1/43 hours

To convert to minutes, we multiply by 60:

t = (1/43) x 60 = 1.3953 minutes

Rounding to the nearest minute, it will take the lion about 1 minute and 24 seconds to catch up to the elephant.

Remembering that "of" means "times," the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\frac{17}{40} \cdot 160$.  This equals $\frac{17 \cdot 160}{40}$, which can be rewritten as $17 \cdot \frac{160}{40}$.  Because $160$ divided by $40$ equals $4$, the expression above is the same as $17 \cdot 4$, which equals $\boxed{68}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem. One way is to use multiplication. If $\frac{17}{40}$ of the aliens have 3 eyes, then the fraction of aliens without 3 eyes is $1-\frac{17}{40}=\frac{23}{40}$. We can use this fraction to find the actual number of aliens without 3 eyes:

$$\frac{23}{40}\cdot 160 = 92$$

Therefore, the number of aliens with 3 eyes is:

$$160-92= \boxed{68}$$

Another way to approach this problem is to use proportions. If $\frac{17}{40}$ of the aliens have 3 eyes, then we can set up the proportion:

$$\frac{17}{40} = \frac{x}{160}$$

where $x$ is the number of aliens with 3 eyes. To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply:

$$17\cdot 160 = 40x$$

Dividing both sides by 40, we get:

$$x = \frac{17\cdot 160}{40} = 68$$

Therefore, the number of aliens with 3 eyes is $\boxed{68}$.

If we let $s$ be the side length of one square, we have that one side length makes up the height of the rectangle and three side lengths makes up the length of the rectangle. Then, in terms of $s$, the rectangle has a perimeter of $s+3s+s+3s=8s$. We know that the perimeter of the rectangle is $104$ inches, so we have that $8s=104$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $8$, we have that $s=13$. One square must have an area of $s^2=13^2=\boxed{169}$ square inches.

Extracting Answer from: 
Once we've picked the first two digits of a $4$-digit palindrome, the last two digits are automatically chosen by mirroring the first two. Thus, we can make exactly one $4$-digit palindrome for every $2$-digit number. For example, the $2$-digit number $57$ gives the palindrome $5775$.

For an integer to be divisible by $3$, the sum of its digits must also be divisible by $3$. A $4$-digit palindrome has two identical pairs of digits. If the total of all four digits is a multiple of $3$, then the first two digits must also add up to a multiple of $3$ (since doubling a non-multiple of $3$ can't give us a multiple of $3$). Thus, to make a $4$-digit palindrome which is a multiple of $3$, we must use a $2$-digit number that is a multiple of $3$.

This tells us that the number of $4$-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$ is identical to the number of multiples of $3$ from $10$ through $99$. Here is a list of those multiples of $3$: $$12, 15, 18, 21, 24, \ldots, 90, 93, 96, 99.$$ This list consists of the $30$ positive multiples of $3$ greater than $10.$ So, there are $30$ numbers in the list, and therefore $\boxed{30}$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $3$.

Here is a list of those palindromes: $$1221, 1551, 1881, 2112, 2442, \ldots, 9009, 9339, 9669, 9999.$$

A number is divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. Since our palindrome has four digits, it must have the form $ABBA$. We must have $A+B$ congruent to either $0$ or $3$ modulo $3$. Since neither $A$ nor $B$ can be $0$ (or our number would not have four digits), there are $3\times 9=27$ choices for $(A,B)$, of which $18$ have $A+B$ congruent to $3$ and $9$ have $A+B$ congruent to $0$ modulo $3$. For any given pair $(A,B)$, there is exactly one way to form the palindrome $ABBA$. Thus, the answer is $9+18=\boxed{27}$.

To find the profit, we want to find out how much the math club earned from selling the various baked goods and subtract the cost of producing those goods, $\$15$, from the number we get.

First let's calculate how much the math club earned from selling cookies. The cookies were sold at a price of three for $\$1$, so the math club earned $54\div 3\cdot\$1=18\cdot\$1=\$18$ from selling cookies.

Next, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling cupcakes. At a price of $\$2$ each, the club earned $20\cdot \$2=\$40$ from selling cupcakes.

Finally, let's calculate how much the club earned from selling brownies. At a price of $\$1$ each, the club earned $35\cdot\$1=\$35$ from selling brownies.

Now let's add up these numbers to find out how much the club earned in total and subtract $\$15$ from that number to find the club's profit. We obtain \begin{align*}
\$18+\$40+\$35-\$15&=\$18+\$40+\$35-\$15\\
&=\$18+\$40+\$35+(-\$15)\\
&=\$18+\$40+(\$35+(-\$15))\\
&=\$18+\$40+(\$20)\\
&=\boxed{78}.
\end{align*}Notice how we used the definition of subtraction, $a-b=a+(-b)$ to $\$35-\$15$ as $\$35+(-\$15)$ and the associative property of addition to group the numbers together.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the tens digit be $x$ and the units digit be $4x$. Since $0 \le x \le 9$, the possible two-digit integers are $10x+4x = 14x$, $10x+4(9-x) = 6x+36$, and $10(9-x)+4x = 4x+90$. The sum of these is $14x + 6x + 4x + 36 + 90 = 24x+126$. The possible values for $x$ are 1, 2,...,9 so we want to find $\sum_{x=1}^9 (24x+126)$. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, we get $\sum_{x=1}^9 (24x+126) = 9\cdot(24\cdot5 + 126)/2 = \boxed{1575}$.

We want to have the least common denominator, $6$, in the denominator when we add the two fractions. $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2}{6}$.

Adding this to $\frac{1}{6}$, we obtain $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6}$, which can be simplified further since $3$ and $6$ have a common divisor, $3$.  Dividing both the numerator and denominator by $3$, we find that $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$, which is in the most simplified form. So, $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Using the product property of square roots, we have $\sqrt{15}\cdot\sqrt{35}=\sqrt{15\cdot35}$. To simplify, we note that $15=3\cdot5$ and $35=5\cdot7$, so $15\cdot35=(3\cdot5)(5\cdot7)=3\cdot5\cdot5\cdot7=3\cdot25\cdot7$. Therefore, $\sqrt{15}\cdot\sqrt{35}=\sqrt{3\cdot25\cdot7}=\sqrt{525}$. To further simplify, we find the largest perfect square that is a factor of 525. We have $525=5\cdot105=5\cdot(3\cdot35)=5\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7=5^2\cdot3\cdot7$. Thus, $\sqrt{525}=\sqrt{5^2\cdot3\cdot7}=\boxed{5\sqrt{21}}$.

We know that the sum of the interior angles of an octagon is $180(n-2)$ degrees, where $n$ is the number of sides. Plugging in $n=8$, we get that the sum of the interior angles of the octagon is $180(8-2)=1080$ degrees.

To find the measure of one interior angle, we divide the sum of the interior angles by the number of angles in the polygon. An octagon has 8 interior angles, so we divide 1080 by 8 to get $135$ degrees.

Therefore, the measure of an interior angle of the sign is $\boxed{135}$ degrees.

Every five-digit palindrome is of the form $ABCBA$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits.  A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 2 if and only if the digit $A$ is even, so the largest possible digit $A$ is 8.  The number $ABCBA$ is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits, which is $2A + 2B + C$, is divisible by 3.

The largest possible digit $B$ is 9, and if $A = 8$, then $2A + 2B + C = C + 34$.  The largest digit $C$ for which $C + 34$ is divisible by 3 is $C = 8$.  Therefore, the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6 is $\boxed{89898}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. In this case, for a number to be divisible by 2, its units digit must be even (i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). For it to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.

The largest five-digit even palindrome is 99899. We can check if it is divisible by 3 by adding up its digits: $9+9+8+9+9=44$, which is not divisible by 3, so 99899 is not divisible by 3 (and hence not divisible by 6).

Let's try the next largest even palindrome, 99889. Adding up its digits, we get $9+9+8+8+9=43$, which is not divisible by 3. Next, we try 99879, whose digits sum to $9+9+8+7+9=42$, which is divisible by 3. Hence, 99879 is divisible by 3 (and hence by 6).

Therefore, the largest five-digit palindrome that is divisible by 6 is $\boxed{99879}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
At 3:20, the hour hand is pointing between the 3 and the 4, and the minute hand is pointing at the 4. 

The hour hand moves 1/12 of the way around the clock in one hour, or 30 degrees. Since 20 minutes is 1/3 of an hour, or 1/3 of 30 degrees, the hour hand has moved 10 degrees from pointing directly at the 3. 

The minute hand moves all the way around the clock in one hour, or 360 degrees, so in 20 minutes it has moved 1/3 of the way around, or 1/3 of 360 degrees, which is 120 degrees. 

So together, the hands have created an angle of 120 - 10 = 110 degrees. 

However, the question asks for the measure of the "lesser" angle between the hands. Since the hands are moving in opposite directions, they will eventually form an angle of 0 degrees (when they overlap) and the angle between them will decrease until then. 

So instead of 110 degrees, we take the "smaller" angle that they form, which is 360 - 110 = 250 degrees. 

Therefore, the measure of the lesser angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand at 3:20 is 250 degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
Because the legs of a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$ triangle are in the ratio $1:\sqrt{3}:2$, the longer leg must be $6\sqrt{3}$ and the hypotenuse must be $12$. Since the hypotenuse of the right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, one side of the equilateral triangle is 12. The other two sides of the equilateral triangle are also 12.

There are different ways to approach the next step, but one possible method is to use the Law of Cosines. Let $x$ be the distance between the two vertices that the triangles do not have in common. Then in the larger equilateral triangle, we have \begin{align*}
x^2&=12^2+12^2-2(12)(12)\cos(120^\circ)\\
&=288+288+144\\
&=720.

To convert $600$ seconds to minutes, we divide by $60$, since there are $60$ seconds in one minute.  So: $$\frac{600 \text{ seconds}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}$$ Therefore, Casey will need $10$ minutes to paint $300$ dimples on the golf ball.

The grade level in which the number of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the number of female bus riders is the same grade level in which the percentage of male bus riders is closest to $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders. To find what percentage is $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders, we multiply each percentage by $1.35.$ In ninth grade, the percentage is $39.4\cdot1.35=53.19$ percent. In tenth grade, the percentage is $33.1\cdot1.35=44.685$ percent. In eleventh grade, the percentage is $13.8\cdot1.35=18.63$ percent. In twelfth grade, the percentage is $8.6\cdot1.35=11.61$ percent. From inspection, we see that $135\%$ of the percentage of female bus riders in twelfth grade is closest to the percentage of male bus riders in twelfth grade. So the answer is $\boxed{12}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
We are looking for the grade where \[\frac{\text{number of male bus riders in the grade}}{\text{number of female bus riders in the grade}} \approx \frac{135}{100}.\] Let $m$ and $f$ denote the number of male and female bus riders respectively in a given grade. Then, we want $m$ and $f$ to satisfy \[\frac{m}{f} \approx \frac{135}{100} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{m}{f} = 1.35k\] for some positive integer $k$. Rearranging gives $m=1.35kf$. Since $m$ and $f$ are integers, $kf$ must be divisible by 20 (the decimal 1.35 is equivalent to the fraction $\frac{27}{20}$). Also, since $k$ must be a positive integer, we want the quotient $\frac{m}{f}$ to be as close as possible to $\frac{27}{20}$ while still being greater than 1. Thus, $k$ should be the smallest integer such that $1.35k$ is greater than the ratio of males to females in the grade. 

Plugging in the ratios from the table, we get: \begin{align*}
k & = \text{ smallest integer such that } 1.35k > \frac{41.1}{39.4} \\
& = \text{ smallest integer such that } k > \frac{41.1}{1.35 \cdot 39.4} \approx 0.983 \\
& = 1.
\end{align*} Therefore, we want the 9th-grade's ratio to be closest to $\frac{27}{20}$ in the sense described. We see that $1.35 \cdot \frac{39.4}{100} \approx 53$ and $1.35 \cdot \frac{41.1}{100} \approx 56$, so the number of 9th-grade male bus riders is closest to $\boxed{56}$.

The side opposite $30^\circ$ in this triangle is half of the hypotenuse, so $DC=2\sqrt{3}/2=\sqrt{3}$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AD=\sqrt{AB^2-BD^2}=\sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2-\sqrt{3}^2}=3\sqrt{3}$.

Now just use the Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle ACD$:

\begin{align*}
AC^2&=AD^2-DC^2 \\
BC^2&=AC^2-AB^2 \\
x^2&=BC^2-DC^2 \\
x^2&=(AC^2-AB^2)-DC^2 \\

Extracting Answer from: 
One billion meters is equivalent to 1,000,000 kilometers.

Thus, you can calculate the number of trips around Earth by dividing 1,000,000 kilometers by the circumference of Earth:

1,000,000 kilometers ÷ 40,000 kilometers/trip = 25 trips around Earth

Therefore, you could take 25 trips around Earth if you travel one billion meters.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's assume that the total number of frogs in the pond is represented by "x". 

On the first day, 45 frogs were marked and returned to the pond, so:

Number of marked frogs = 45 

Total number of frogs in the pond = x 

Therefore, the proportion of marked frogs in the pond on the first day is:

45/x 

The next day, 40 frogs were observed in the pond, of which 10 had been marked the previous day. This means that there were 30 unmarked frogs in the sample. 

We can set up a proportion to estimate the total number of frogs:

Number of marked frogs in sample/Total number of frogs in sample = Number of marked frogs in pond/Total number of frogs in pond 

Plugging in the values we know: 

10/40 = 45/x 

Solving for "x": 

10x = 40*45 

x = 180 

Therefore, the best estimate of how many frogs live in the pond is 180.

Let $x = 0.0\overline{57}$. Multiplying both sides by $1000,$ we get $1000x = 57.\overline{57}$. Subtracting $x$ from $1000x$ gives us $999x = 57,$ so $x = \dfrac{57}{999}$. This fraction cannot be simplified any further, so $\dfrac{57}{999}$ is equivalent to $0.0\overline{57}$. Our final answer is $\boxed{\dfrac{57}{999}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can find the area of the gray figure by subtracting the sum of the areas of the white squares from the area of the large square.

The area of each white square is $(6 \text{ units})^2 = 36 \text{ sq. units}$, so the sum of the areas of the white squares is $2 \cdot 36 \text{ sq. units} = 72 \text{ sq. units}$.

The large square has sides of length $2 \cdot 6 \text{ units} = 12 \text{ units}$, so its area is $(12 \text{ units})^2 = 144 \text{ sq. units}$.

Therefore, the area of the gray figure is $144 \text{ sq. units} - 72 \text{ sq. units} = \boxed{72} \text{ sq. units}$.

We are trying to determine how many possible combinations of two numbers between 1 and 20 would make it so that the first number is a factor of the second number and the second number is a factor of the first number.  We know that all of the positive factors of a positive number, except for the number itself, are less than the number.  Therefore, if Jenna's number is greater than Mary's number, Jenna's number cannot be a divisor of Mary's number, and Jenna cannot win.

Likewise, if Jenna's number is less than Mary's number, Mary's number must be greater than Jenna's number, Mary's number cannot be a divisor of Jenna's number, and Mary cannot win.  If Jenna's number is equal to Mary's number, both girls' numbers are factors of the other's number because any number is a factor of itself.  Thus, we can determine that for both girls to win, they must roll the same number.  Since there are 20 numbers on the dice, this means that there are $\boxed{20}$ rolls for which both girls would win.

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DA=DB = DC = 5$, so $BC = BD+DC = 10$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(5)({10})}{2} = \boxed{25}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $AD=x$, $AB=AC=y$, and $BC=z$. Then $BD=z-5$ and $AB^2=x^2+(z-5)^2=y^2$. But since $ABC$ is isosceles, $y=z$. Thus we have $x^2=5z-25$ and $z^2=2x^2=10z-50$, so $z=10$ and $x^2=25$, or $x=5$ (since $x>0$). Hence $AB=AC=y=\sqrt{x^2+z^2-5^2}=\sqrt{10^2-5^2}=\sqrt{75}=5\sqrt{3}$, and the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $(AB)^2/2=(5\sqrt{3})^2/2=\boxed{\frac{75}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can simplify the fraction by finding a common factor of the numerator and denominator. The number 10 is a common factor, since both 100 and 180 are evenly divisible by 10. We can simplify by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 10, giving us: 

$$\frac{100}{180} = \frac{10 \cdot 10}{10 \cdot 18} = \frac{10}{18}$$

Now we can simplify further by finding a common factor of 10 and 18. The greatest common factor of 10 and 18 is 2, so we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 2: 

$$\frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9}$$

Therefore, $\frac{100}{180}$ simplifies to $\frac{5}{9}$.

Multiplying $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5$ gives $2^2\cdot3\cdot5$. So our expression becomes \[1+2^2\cdot3\cdot5\div11.\] We can simplify $2^2\cdot3\cdot5$ as $60$, so our expression becomes \[1+60\div11.\] In order to divide by 11, we can find ten groups of 11 in 60, which leaves 5. Therefore, $60\div11=5\frac{5}{11}$. Substituting this back into our expression, we get  \[1+5\frac{5}{11}.\] Adding these together gives \[\frac{16}{11}+5\frac{5}{11}.\] We can find a common denominator, $11$, so that the sum becomes \[\frac{16}{11}+\frac{5\cdot11}{11}=\frac{16+55}{11}=\boxed{\frac{71}{11}}.\]

We divide the shape into two rectangles, $A$ and $B,$ by constructing the dotted line segment of length $2$ units shown. The area of rectangle $A$ is $2\times3=6$ square units. The length of rectangle $B$ is $6$ units plus the length of the dotted line segment, or $6+2=8.$ Thus, the area of rectangle $B$ is $8\times5=40$ square units. The area of the entire figure is the sum of the areas of rectangles $A$ and $B,$ or $6+40=\boxed{46}$ square units. [asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we recall that the reciprocal of a negative number is the negation of the reciprocal: $\frac{1}{-x} = -\frac{1}{x}$. Thus, we can rewrite $\frac{1}{-6}$ as $-\frac{1}{6}$. Now our expression is $-\frac{1}{6} \cdot 6 \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot (7-1)$.

We need to to what is in parentheses first, so we subtract 1 from 7 to get 6. Our expression is now $-\frac{1}{6} \cdot 6 \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6$.

Because multiplication and division is performed before addition and subtraction, we multiply and divide first, going from left to right. A number times its reciprocal is one, so our expression is $(-1) \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6$. Multiplying and dividing from left to right, we find  \begin{align*}
(-1) \cdot 7 + 8 \cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6 &= (-7) + 8\cdot 2 \div 8 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 16 \div 8 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 2 \cdot 6 \\
&= (-7) + 12.
\end{align*}Now, completing the addition, our answer is $\boxed{5}$.

Since angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary, we know that $A+B=90^\circ$. Let $7x$ be the measure of angle $A$ and $23x$ be the measure of angle $B$. Then, we have \begin{align*}
7x+23x&=90^\circ\\
30x&=90^\circ\\
x&=3^\circ
\end{align*} Therefore, $A=7x=21^\circ$ and $B=23x=69^\circ$. The complement of angle $A$ has measure $90^\circ-21^\circ=69^\circ$ and the complement of angle $B$ has measure $90^\circ-69^\circ=21^\circ$. Therefore, the ratio of the measure of the complement of angle $A$ to the measure of the complement of angle $B$ is $$\frac{69^\circ}{21^\circ}=\boxed{\frac{23}{7}}.$$

The arithmetic mean of four numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 4. We can set up an equation using this fact and solve for $x$: $$\frac{7+2+x+10}{4}=9$$ Simplifying the left side gives: $$\frac{19+x}{4}=9$$ Multiplying both sides by 4 gives: $$19+x=36$$ Subtracting 19 from both sides gives: $$x=17$$ Therefore, the value of $x$ is $\boxed{17}$.

Let's call the original number "x". We know that x is negative because when we multiply it by 6 (a positive number), we get a result that is 20 less than x (a negative number). 

Using algebra, we can write:

6x = x - 20 

Solving for x, we can simplify this equation by subtracting x from both sides: 

5x = -20 

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 5: 

x = -4

Extracting Answer from: 
First we notice that since $a$ and $b$ are distinct, their product must be at least $80.$ From here, we might try listing some factors of $80$ and trying products of pairs of factors until we get a product that is not a factor of $80.$ But we can be cleverer than that. We know that any factor of $80$ can be written in the form $2^i5^j$ for some $0\le i\le4$ and $0\le j\le1.$ So we can write $$a=2^i5^j, \quad b=2^k5^\ell,$$ where without loss of generality, we may assume that $i < k.$ Then $$ab = 2^{i+k}5^{j+\ell},$$ and since $a \neq b,$ we have that $k > i.$ This tells us that $ab$ has more than two factors of $2,$ so it is certainly a divisor of $80.$ To minimize $ab,$ we take $k=i+1,$ so $a=2^i5^j, b=2^{i+1}5^\ell.$ Since $i$ and $i+1$ differ by $1,$ we can be sure that $ab$ is not a factor of $80$ if and only if both $i$ and $\ell$ are equal to $0,$ so $j=\ell=0$ and we get $$ab=2^05^0\cdot2^15^0=\boxed{2}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The two right triangles on the ends of the rectangle can be pushed together to form an equilateral triangle that is identical to each of the other equilateral triangles in the diagram.  So, $AB$ is equal to the total length of 3 side lengths of an equilateral triangle.  Therefore, each side of each equilateral triangle has length $12/3 = 4$.  Therefore, our problem is to find the total area of two equilateral triangles with side length 4.

Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]
unitsize(0.6inch);
pair A, B, C, F;
A = (0,1);
B = rotate(120)*A;
C = rotate(120)*B;
F = foot(A,B,C);
draw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));
draw(A--F);
[/asy]

An altitude of an equilateral triangle is therefore $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of half the side length of the triangle.  Therefore, an equilateral triangle with side length 4 has altitude length $\sqrt{3}(4/2) = 2\sqrt{3}$, and area $(2\sqrt{3})(4)/2 = 4\sqrt{3}$ square units.  The shaded regions consist of two of these equilateral triangles, so their total area is $2(4\sqrt{3}) = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The shaded area consists of three trapezoids, each of which is half of an equilateral triangle missing a smaller equilateral triangle. Let $s$ be the side length of the equilateral triangles, so $s^2 = 2\cdot6^2 = 72$. The area of a whole equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$, so the area of the missing triangle is $\frac14$ of the total, or $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{16}s^2$. The area of one of the trapezoids is $\frac12(s + 12)h$, where $h$ is the height of the missing triangle. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the height of the missing triangle is $\sqrt{s^2 - \left(\frac12s\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s$, so the area of the trapezoid is $$\frac12\cdot(s+12)\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}s=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(s^2+12s) = \frac{54\sqrt{3}}{4}.$$The area of all three trapezoids together is $3\cdot\frac{54\sqrt{3}}{4} = 41\sqrt{3}$, so the answer is $\boxed{41\sqrt{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the sum of the percentages of oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen add up to $65\%+18\%+10\%=93\%$. To find the percent of the human body that is made up of elements other than these three, we subtract $93\%$ from $100\%$: \begin{align*}
100\%-93\% &= 7\%
\end{align*} Therefore, $\boxed{7\%}$ of the human body is made up of elements other than oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen.

First, we can evaluate the sum across the first row, which gives $(n+1)+1+(n-1)=2n+1$.  Evaluate the sum of the entries across the second row, $3+(2n-9)+n=3n-6$. Now, since we have a magic square, these two sums are equal.  So $2n+1=3n-6$. Isolating $n$, we obtain $n = \boxed{7}$.

Let the sum of each row, column, and diagonal be $S$. Thus, we can set up the following equations:
\begin{align*}
n-3+3+(n+1)&=n+(2n-9)+1\\
n+1+2+n&=2n-9+n-1\\
n-1+1+2&=n+1+(n-9)+n\\
n+2+n-9+n&=n-3+1+n-1
\end{align*}
Simplifying each equation gives:
\begin{align*}
2n+1&=3n-8\\
4n&=10\\
3n&=12\\
3n-6&=2n-3
\end{align*}
Solving for $n$ in each equation gives $n=9,\frac{5}{2},4,$ and $3$, respectively. However, it is easy to check that $n=\boxed{9}$ is the only solution that works in the magic square.

We note that $2013$ has the property: since the sum of the digits of 201, $2+0+1=3$, is divisible by $3$, $201$ is itself divisible by $3$. We must now check whether any odd-numbered years before $2013$ have the property. $200$ is not divisible by the prime $7$, so $2007$ does not have this property. Likewise, the sum of the digits of $200$ is $2$, which is not divisible by $3$, so $200$ and $9=3^2$ are relatively prime. Clearly $2011$ does not have the desired property since every natural number is relatively prime to $1$. Thus, the first odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has the desired property is $\boxed{2013}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We look at the three cases separately. In each case, let $n$ and $m$ be the two parts of the year being considered. 

Case 1: $n=20m$. Since $m$ has only one digit, it follows that $m=2,4,5,6,8$. Hence we have the years $2004$, $2008$, $2010$, $2012$, and $2016$.

Case 2: $n=2m$. In this case, $m$ has two or three digits. We note that $m$ cannot begin with $5$ or higher, since otherwise $100m+n$ would be in the thousands, which is not possible. This leaves the possibilities $20\le m \le 28$ and $200\le m \le 284$. Checking each case individually, we find that the only year that works is $2018$.

Case 3: $n=5m$. Since $m$ has only one digit, it follows that $m=1,2,4,5,8$. The corresponding years are $2005$, $2010$, $2020$, $2025$, and $2030$. 

The next odd-numbered year after $2006$ that has this property is $\boxed{2019}$.

Let the unknown number of male listeners be $x$. From the table, we can see that the total number of males surveyed is 136. Therefore, the percentage of male listeners is $$\frac{x}{136} \cdot 100\% = ?\%$$ To solve for $x$, we can use the fact that the total number of listeners is 200. From the table, we can see that the number of female listeners is 96, so the number of male listeners must be $$x + 58 = 200 - 96 = 104.$$ Then, we have $$\frac{x}{136} \cdot 100\% = \frac{104-58}{136} \cdot 100\% = \frac{46}{136} \cdot 100\% \approx \boxed{33.8\%}.$$

Since the sum of the interior angle measures of a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, the sum of the measures of angles $BCD$, $DEA$, and $ABC$ is $540 - 100-110-40 = 290$ degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle $A$ is $360-290 = \boxed{70}$ degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 9 vertices in the polygon, so from each vertex there are potentially 8 other vertices to which we could extend a diagonal.  However, 2 of these 8 points are connected to the original point by an edge, so they are not connected by interior diagonals.  So each vertex is connected to 6 other points by interior diagonals.  This gives a preliminary count of $9 \times 6 = 54$ interior diagonals.  However, we have counted each diagonal twice (once for each of its endpoints), so we must divide by 2 to correct for this overcounting, and the answer is $\dfrac{9\times 6}{2} = \boxed{27}$ diagonals.

We will locate the numbers on the number line.  $4.5$ goes half way between $4$ and $5$ because $0.5=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}.$.

Note that $4.45$ goes half way between $4.4$ and $4.5$ because $$0.4=\frac{4}{10}=\frac{8}{20}, \ \ 0.5=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{10}{20}, \ \ \text{and} \ \ 0.45=\frac{9}{20}.$$Likewise, $0.45$ goes half way between $0.4$ and $0.5$ because $$0.4=\frac{4}{10}=\frac{8}{20}, \ \ 0.5=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{10}{20}, \ \ \text{and} \ \ 0.45=\frac{9}{20}.$$Finally, $0.54$ goes just a little bit less than halfway between $0.5$ and $0.6$ because $0.54$ is just a little bit smaller than $0.55,$ which is half way between $0.5$ and $0.6.$

Let $x$ denote $\angle PQS.$ Since $\triangle PSQ$ is isosceles, we know that $\angle SPQ = \angle PQS = x.$ Then, since the angles in $\triangle PQS$ add up to $180^\circ,$ we can write an equation involving $x:$ \begin{align*}
\angle PSQ + \angle PQS + \angle QSP &= 180^\circ \\
65^\circ + x + x &= 180^\circ \\

By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle PQR$, $$PQ^2 = PR^2 - QR^2 = 13^2 - 5^2 = 144,$$so $PQ=\sqrt{144}=12$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem in $\triangle PQS$, $$QS^2 = PS^2 - PQ^2 = 37^2 - 12^2 = 1225,$$so $QS = \sqrt{1225}=35$.

Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle PQS$ is $12+35+37=\boxed{84}$.

First, we find the length of $\overline{PR}$ using the Pythagorean theorem: $$PR = \sqrt{PQ^2 + QR^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 5^2} = 13.$$Next, we find the length of $\overline{PS}$ using the Pythagorean theorem: $$PS = \sqrt{PQ^2 + QS^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 20^2} = 4\sqrt{37}.$$Therefore, the perimeter of $\triangle PQS$ is $$PQ+QS+PS = 12 + 4\sqrt{37} + 37 = \boxed{49 + 4\sqrt{37}}.$$This answer is exact and cannot be simplified further.

Make a table to organize the information about the cost and the volume of the three tubes of toothpaste.  Let the number of units of volume in one tube of Fresh be $u$.  Then the cost of one tube of Fresh is $\$u$.  Since Bright is more expensive than Fresh by $60\%$, one tube of Bright costs $\$\,\frac{8}{5}u$.  Also, since Glow has $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ more volume than Fresh, the volume of a tube of Glow is $\frac{4}{3}u$ units.   \[
\begin{array}{c|cc}
& \text{volume} & \text{cost} \\ \hline
\text{Bright} & & \$\,\frac{8}{5}u \\
\text{Fresh} & u & \$\,u\\
\text{Glow} & \frac{4}{3}u &
\end{array}
\]Finally, multiply the volume of Glow by $\frac{3}{4}$ to find the volume of Bright, and multiply the cost of Bright by $\frac{3}{4}$ to find the cost of Glow. \[
\begin{array}{c|cc}

Let's call the price of Fresh toothpaste $f$ (in dollars per unit of volume). Then Bright is $60\%$ more expensive, or $1.6f$, and Glow is $25\%$ less expensive than Bright, or $(0.75)(1.6f) = 1.2f$. 

Similarly, let's call the volume of Fresh toothpaste $v$ (in some unit of volume, like fluid ounces). Then Glow has $33\frac{1}{3}\%$ more volume than Fresh, or $1.333v$, and Bright has $25\%$ less volume than Glow, or $(0.75)(1.333v) = 0.99975v$. 

We want to find the price of Glow per unit of volume, which is $\frac{1.2f}{1.333v} = \frac{6f}{6.665v} = \boxed{90}$ cents per unit of volume, since $f = 1.00$ by definition.

We want to find $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7} - \frac{5}{8}$.  The common denominator is 56, so we try to rewrite each of the three fractions with 56 on the bottom.

$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{28}{28} = \frac{28}{56}$. Also, $\frac{2}{7} = \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{8} = \frac{16}{56}$. Finally, $\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5}{8} \cdot \frac{7}{7} = \frac{35}{56}$.

Thus, we have $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{7} - \frac{5}{8} = \frac{28}{56} + \frac{16}{56} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{28+16-35}{56} = \frac{44-35}{56} = \frac{9}{56}$.  Because 9 and 56 have no common divisors, this is the simplest form, and our answer is $\boxed{\frac{9}{56}}$.

We can start by finding $\frac{2}{7}$ of $\frac{1}{2}$ scoop of ice cream. To do that, we multiply: $$\frac{2}{7}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2\cdot 1}{7\cdot 2} = \frac{1}{7}.$$ So, after asking the vendor for $\frac{2}{7}$ more scoops of ice cream, you have a total of $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{7}$ scoops of ice cream. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is $14$: $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{7} = \frac{7}{14} + \frac{2}{14} = \frac{9}{14}.$$ So, you had $\frac{9}{14}$ scoops of ice cream to start with.

Next, we need to subtract the $\frac{5}{8}$ scoop of ice cream that you ate. To do that, we'll convert $\frac{5}{8}$ to an equivalent fraction with denominator $14$: $$\frac{5}{8} = \frac{5\cdot 1}{8\cdot 1} = \frac{5\cdot 7}{8\cdot 7} = \frac{35}{56}.$$ Now, we can subtract: $$\frac{9}{14} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{36}{56} - \frac{35}{56} = \frac{1}{56}.$$ So, there is $\boxed{\frac{1}{56}}$ scoop of ice cream left on your cone after you eat $\frac{5}{8}$ scoop.

Since $AB=1\frac{2}{3}$, we know that $AD=AB+DE=\frac{5}{3}+1\frac{1}{12}=\frac{77}{36}$.

Since we know $AE=6$, this means that $ED=6-AD=6-\frac{77}{36}=\frac{143}{36}$.

Since $BC=1\frac{1}{4}$, we know that $CD=BC-BD$, where $BD=DE+CE$.

Since we know $DE=\frac{143}{36}$, we just need to find $CE$.

Since $CE=AE-AC$, we just need to find $AC$.

Since we know $AB=1\frac{2}{3}$ and $BC=1\frac{1}{4}$, we know that $AC=AB+BC=\frac{5}{3}+1\frac{1}{4}=\frac{23}{12}$.

Therefore, $CE=6-\frac{23}{12}=\frac{49}{12}$.

Now we can find $BD=DE+CE=\frac{143}{36}+\frac{49}{12}=\frac{229}{36}$.

We begin by listing the smallest positive perfect cubes with two digits or fewer:

1, 8, 27, 64.

And now we sum them.  $1+1+1$ is too small; $1+1+8=10$ which is not prime; but $1+8+8=17$, which is indeed a prime.  Hence the answer is $\boxed{17}$.

Clearly, all positive cubes are congruent to 0 or $\pm 1\pmod{9}$. Hence, the sum of three positive cubes is congruent to a number of the form $3k$, $3k + 1$, or $3k - 1$ (in mod $9$). The smallest two-digit primes that are congruent to $2$ or $4$ mod $9$ are $11$ and $23$, respectively, so we only need to check those two cases.


$11 = 1 + 1 + 9$ does not work, since the number $9$ obviously cannot be expressed as the sum of two cubes, and we are not allowed to use distinct cubes.


$23 = 8 + 8 + 7$ does work, so the answer is $\boxed{23}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We have that $(7^{-1})^{-1} = 7$. 

To see why, recall that $7^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of 7, meaning that $7\cdot 7^{-1} = 1$. 

Then, $(7^{-1})^{-1}$ is asking what number we need to raise $7^{-1}$ to in order to get 1. In other words, we're looking for the multiplicative inverse of $7^{-1}$. 

We can find this by multiplying $7^{-1}$ by itself: $7^{-1} \cdot 7^{-1} = (7\cdot 7)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1$. 

So, the multiplicative inverse of $7^{-1}$ is $7$, which means that $(7^{-1})^{-1} = 7$.

So $\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)\left(\frac{123}{321}\right)^{-1}$ is the fraction 123/321 times its reciprocal. By the definition of reciprocal, this product is 1. Similarly, $\left(\frac{456}{654}\right) \left(\frac{456}{654}\right)^{-1}$ and $\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)\left(\frac{789}{987}\right)^{-1}$ also equal 1.

Prime factorize 715 to find $715=5\cdot11\cdot13$.  The only ways to write 715 as a product of positive integers greater than 1 are the distinct ways of grouping the prime factors: \begin{align*}

(5\cdot11)\cdot 13&=55\cdot 13 \\

(5\cdot11\cdot13)&=715,
\end{align*} where the last one is a product with only one factor.  Since the letters cannot represent numbers greater than 26, only $5\cdot11\cdot 13$ could come from calculating the product value of a word. The 5th, 11th, and 13th letters of the alphabet are E, K, and M.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to find words that have a product value of 715. We can prime factorize 715 as $5\cdot11\cdot13$. We need to find a word whose letters have values that multiply to these prime factors. Let's look at each prime factor separately.

For the prime factor of 5, the only letter values that work are 5 and 1. Therefore, the word must contain at least one E (which has a value of 5).

For the prime factor of 11, the possible letter values are 11 and 1. We could use K (which has a value of 11), but we also need to account for the fact that the word has a product value of 715. Since 715 is not a multiple of 11, it's clear that we cannot use more than one K. Instead, we must use letters that have a product value of 1. This includes A, C, D, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, R, and U. We could also use a second E to make up for the lack of K's.

For the prime factor of 13, the possible letter values are 13 and 1. We cannot use M (which has a value of 13) since we've already used the letter E and we cannot use more than one letter of the same kind. Instead, we must use letters that have a product value of 1. This includes A, C, D, G, H, I, L, N, O, P, R, U, and Y.

Putting these ideas together, we see that the word that fits the description is "GUIDE". We can check that its product value is indeed $7\cdot11\cdot5\cdot1\cdot1=385$. Since the product value of GUIDE is not equal to 715, we need to find a word with a different combination of letters and values. The next possibility is to use two K's, which gives us the word "KIWI". This has a product value of $11\cdot9\cdot23\cdot9=715$, so our answer is $\boxed{\text{KIWI}}$.

We can also see that $8$ and $12$ have a common factor of $4$.  Therefore, we can simplify to get $$\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\cdot \frac{20}{12}=\frac{1}{\cancel{5}}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{2}{8}}{7}\cdot \frac{\cancelto{4}{20}}{\cancelto{3}{12}}=\frac{1\cdot 2 \cdot 4}{7\cdot 3}=\boxed{\frac{8}{21}}.$$

We begin by simplifying $\frac{12}{20}$ to $\frac{3}{5}$. This gives us $\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\div \frac{3}{5}$. To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal. So we can rewrite the expression as $\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\cdot \frac{5}{3}$. This simplifies to $\frac{8}{21}$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{5}\cdot \frac{8}{7}\div \frac{12}{20} = \boxed{\frac{8}{21}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 15 choices for president. After president is chosen, there are 13 remaining choices for the next office, because one person (the vice-president) cannot be elected. Since either the secretary or the treasurer must be elected as vice-president, there are 2 choices for vice-president. Finally, there are 11 remaining choices for the last office. Thus, the total number of ways to choose the four officers is $15\cdot 13\cdot 2\cdot 11 = \boxed{4290}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The water is flowing in at 20 milliliters a minute and draining at 18 milliliters a minute.  This means that 2 milliliters will be added to the water in the birdbath each minute.  The best graph to represent this is a line with a positive slope, so we can immediately eliminate graphs B and E.  Graph A shows an increasing line all the way across at a uniform rate.  This cannot be the case since the birdbath would become infinitely deep in water.  Graphs C and D both start at the same location but graph C has a flatter slope.  As the water continues to run into the birdbath, it will begin to overflow, which means the amount of water flowing out of the birdbath will be equal to the amount of water flowing into the birdbath.  This creates a horizontal line which is visible in both graphs.  However, graph D is increasing at a greater rate than graph C, which would mean that the birdbath is filling faster, and therefore overflowing sooner, than the birdbath in graph C.  Graph C is the best answer.  The answer is $\boxed{\text{(C)}}$.

Converting the sum to a decimal gives $$
10^0 + 10^1 + 10^2 + 10^3 + 10^4 + 10^5 = 111,\!111.
$$The numbers $10^0,$ $10^1,$ $10^2,$ $10^3,$ $10^4,$ and $10^5$ are all less than $111,\! 111,$ so they all lie to the left of $111,\! 111$ on the number line. Since $10^5$ is greater than $10^0,$ $10^1,$ $10^2,$ $10^3,$ and $10^4,$ it lies further to the right than these five powers of $10$ on the number line, so it is closer to $111,\!111$ than these five powers of $10.$ Therefore, either $10^5$ or $10^6$ have to be the number among the answer choices that is closest to $111,\!111.$

Rounding $111,\!111$ to the nearest million gives $0,$ so $111,\!111$ is at least $500,\!000$ away from $10^6.$

Note that $10^5 = 100,\!000$ and $$111,\!111 - 100,\!000 = 11,\!111,$$which is much less than $500,\!000,$ so $10^5$ is closer to $111,\!111$ than $10^6.$ So our final answer is $\boxed{F}.$

We can estimate the sum by rounding these three numbers to the nearest power of $10$. Specifically, $1000$ is closest to $10^3$, $10000$ is already a power of $10$, and $100000$ is closest to $10^5$.

We have $\frac29 + \frac17 = \frac{14}{63} + \frac{9}{63} = \frac{23}{63}$.  Expressing $\frac{23}{63}$ as a decimal using long division, we find $\frac{23}{63}=0.\overline{365079}$.  Therefore, every 6th digit after the decimal point is a 9.  So, the 18th digit is a 9; the 20th digit is 2 decimal places later, so it is a $\boxed{6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To add $\frac{2}{9}$ and $\frac{1}{7}$, we must find a common denominator. Since $9$ and $7$ have no common factor besides $1$, we multiply the denominators together to get $63$. We have $\frac{2}{9} = \frac{2\cdot 7}{9\cdot 7} = \frac{14}{63}$ and $\frac{1}{7} = \frac{1\cdot 9}{7\cdot 9} = \frac{9}{63}$. Adding these, we get $$\frac{14}{63} + \frac{9}{63} = \frac{23}{63}.$$To find the $20$th digit, we need to find the value of the decimal expansion of $\frac{23}{63}$ out to $20$ decimal places. We can write $$\frac{23}{63}=\frac{20}{63}+\frac{3}{63}=\frac{20}{63}+\frac{1}{21}.$$Recall that the decimal expansion of $\frac{1}{n}$, for some positive integer $n$, becomes a repeating decimal with a period dividing $n-1$. Therefore, $\frac{1}{21}$ has a repeating decimal expansion with period $6$, and starts $.047619\overline{047619}$. Similarly, $\frac{20}{63}$ has a repeating decimal expansion with period $6$, and starts $.3174\overline{603}\,$. Thus, the decimal expansion of $\frac{23}{63}$ has a repeating decimal expansion with period $6$, and its first $20$ digits are\begin{align*}
.3174\:&603079\:\:047619\:047619\:\\

We want to convert $3$ pounds to kilograms using the conversion factor $1$ kilogram $= 2.20$ pounds. We can set up the proportion: $$\frac{1\text{ kg}}{2.20\text{ lb}}=\frac{x\text{ kg}}{3\text{ lb}}$$ where $x$ is the amount of veal Alice should buy in kilograms. To solve for $x$, we cross-multiply and get: $$2.20\text{ lb}\cdot x\text{ kg}=1\text{ kg}\cdot3\text{ lb}$$ Dividing both sides by $2.20\text{ lb}$, we get: $$x\text{ kg}=\frac{1\text{ kg}\cdot3\text{ lb}}{2.20\text{ lb}}\approx1.36\text{ kg}$$ Alice should buy approximately $\boxed{1.36}$ kilograms of veal.

We know that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\sqrt{6}$ and the ratio of the length shortest leg to that of the hypotenuse is $1:2$. Therefore, the length of the shorter leg is $\sqrt{6}$. Since the ratio of the shorter leg to the longer leg is $1:\sqrt{3}$, the length of the longer leg is $\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In a $30-60-90$ triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is $\sqrt{3}$ times the length of the shorter leg and $2$ times the length of the longer leg. Let $x$ be the length of the shorter leg in centimeters. Then, we have $$2x = \sqrt{3} \cdot x\sqrt{3} = x\cdot (2\sqrt{3})$$ as the length of the longer leg is $2x$. We are also given that the length of the hypotenuse is $2\sqrt{6}$ centimeters, so we can set up the equation $$2x\sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{6}.$$ Solving for $x$ gives $x = \sqrt{\frac{6}{3}} = \sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the two legs is $x + 2x = 3x = \boxed{3\sqrt{2}}$ centimeters.

We first calculate the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 0 through 99.  If we consider all such numbers as two-digit (e.g. write 04 instead of 4), the sum of digits will be unchanged.  Then we see that each digit appears an equal number of times in the ones place, and similarly for the tens place, meaning it appears a total of $2\cdot \frac{100}{10} = 20$ times.  Thus the sum of all digits used to write the whole numbers 00 through 99 is $20\cdot (0 + 1 +\cdots + 8 + 9) = 900$.  The sum of the digits from 100 to 110 is just $(1 + 0) + (1 + 1) + (1 + 2) + \cdots + (1+9) + 2 = 57$.  Thus our final answer is $900 + 57 = \boxed{957}$.

We can then rewrite each of the three fractions so that they have a denominator of $12$. Since $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{6} = \frac{6}{12}$ , $\frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{4} = \frac{4}{12}$ , and $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{3} = \frac{3}{12}$, our sum is: $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{6+4+3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}.$$Taking the reciprocal of this sum, we have that our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{12}{13}}$.

We know that 1/16 of a pound of cookie dough can make one cookie and we know that Annie has 3/2 pounds of cookie dough. To find the number of cookies that she can make, we have to find how many 1/16s there are in 3/2. This is the same as asking "what is 3/2 divided by 1/16?" so we want to find $$\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{1}{16}.$$We remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal and the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{16}$ is $\frac{16}{1}$. Therefore, we have that $$\frac{3}{2} \div \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{16}{1} = \frac{3 \cdot 16}{2} = \frac{48}{2} = 24.$$Annie can make $\boxed{24}$ cookies.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 6 possible outcomes for the first roll and 6 possible outcomes for the second roll, giving a total of $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ possible outcomes.

To get a sum of 7, we need one die to show 1 and the other die to show 6, or one die to show 2 and the other die to show 5, and so on until one die to show 6 and the other to show 1.

There are 6 possible pairs of numbers that add up to 7: $(1,6)$, $(2,5)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$, $(5,2)$, and $(6,1)$. For each of these pairs, there are 2 ways to roll the dice and get this sum (e.g. a 1 on the first die and a 6 on the second die or a 6 on the first die and a 1 on the second die). Therefore, there are a total of $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ ways to get a sum of 7.

The probability of getting a sum of 7 is therefore $12/36 = \boxed{\frac13}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to calculate how many gallons of gasoline Karla used in her SUV:
12000 miles / 15 miles per gallon = 800 gallons

If Karla had driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car averaging 48 miles per gallon, she would only have needed:
12000 miles / 48 miles per gallon = 250 gallons

To calculate the difference in gallons of gasoline she would have saved, we subtract the hybrid gallons from the SUV gallons:
800 gallons - 250 gallons = 550 gallons

Therefore, Karla would have saved 550 gallons of gasoline last year if she had driven a fuel-efficient hybrid car instead of an SUV.

Since the ratio of the angle measures is $3:2:1$, the angles have measures $3x$, $2x$, and $x$ for some value of $x$.  The angle measures of a triangle sum to $180^\circ$, so we have $3x+2x+x = 180^\circ$.  Simplifying gives $6x=180^\circ$, so $x=30^\circ$.  Therefore, the angle measures are $90^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $30^\circ$, which means the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\cdot 12 = \boxed{24}$ meters.

Let's call the measures of the angles 3x, 2x, and x. We know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so:

3x + 2x + x = 180
6x = 180
x = 30

Now we know that the angles of the triangle are 90 degrees (3x), 60 degrees (2x), and 30 degrees (x). We also know that the shortest side is opposite the smallest angle, so it is opposite the 30 degree angle. Let's call this side "a". We can use the sine function to find the length of the longest side, which is opposite the 90 degree angle. Let's call this side "c".

sin(90) = c/a
1 = c/a
c = a

So the longest side is the same length as the shortest side, which we know is 12 meters. Therefore, the answer is 12 meters.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the number of cheese danishes $x$. Then, according to the problem, the number of cherry danishes is at least $3+\frac{2}{3}x$, but no more than $2x$. So we can write two inequalities:

$$3+\frac{2}{3}x \leq C \leq 2x$$

where $C$ is the number of cherry danishes. We want to find the smallest possible value of $C+x$, which represents the total number of danishes.

To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest possible value of $x$ that satisfies both inequalities. First, let's solve the second inequality:

$$C \leq 2x$$
$$\frac{1}{2}C \leq x$$

We can substitute this into the first inequality:

$$3+\frac{2}{3}x \leq C$$
$$3+\frac{2}{3}(\frac{1}{2}C) \leq C$$
$$\frac{7}{3}C \geq 9$$
$$C \geq \frac{27}{7} \approx 3.86$$

Since $C$ must be an integer (since it represents the number of danishes), the smallest possible value of $C$ that satisfies this inequality is $4$. Substituting this into the second inequality, we get:

$$\frac{1}{2}C \leq x$$
$$2 \leq x$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We consider a hand at the 12 to be $0^\circ$. Now we convert the hour and minute hands to a degree measure from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$. If we divide $360^\circ$ evenly among 60 minutes, we get that each minute, the minute hand moves $\frac{360^\circ}{60}=6^\circ$. So if the minute hand is at 48 minutes, it is at $48\cdot6^\circ=288^\circ$.

The hour hand is a little trickier. If we divide $360^\circ$ evenly among 12 hours, we get that each hour, the hour hand moves $\frac{360^\circ}{12}=30^\circ$. Note that the hour hand is not at the 2 since it gradually moves toward the 3 throughout the hour. From the 2 toward the 3, the hour hand has moved $\frac{48}{60}=\frac{4}{5}$ of the way. So the degree measure of the hour hand is $2\frac{4}{5}\cdot30^\circ=84^\circ$.

To find the smaller angle formed by the two hands, we can find the larger angle $288^\circ-84^\circ=204^\circ$ and subtract from $360^\circ$ to get $\boxed{156^\circ}$. Or we know that $84^\circ$ is coterminal with (ends at the same place as) $84^\circ+360^\circ=444^\circ$. Now we can subtract $444^\circ-288^\circ=\boxed{156^\circ}$ to find the smaller angle.

At $2\!:\!00$ the hour hand is at $2\cdot 30^\circ=60^\circ$. The minute hand is at $0^\circ$. The angle between the hands is then $$|60^\circ-0^\circ|=60^\circ.$$ In the next $48$ minutes the hour hand moves $\frac{48}{60}\cdot 30^\circ=24^\circ$ from $60^\circ$ to $84^\circ$. The minute hand moves the full circle in $60$ minutes, so it moves $\frac{48}{60}\cdot 360^\circ=288^\circ$ from $0^\circ$ to $288^\circ$. The angle between the hands is now $$|84^\circ-288^\circ|=|204^\circ|=180^\circ + 24^\circ=\boxed{204^\circ}.$$[asy]

Since the area of the square is 49 square inches, the side length of the square is $\sqrt{49} = 7$ square inches.  Each triangle formed by the fold is a 45-45-90 triangle whose legs are sides of the square and whose hypotenuse is the fold.  So, two sides of the triangle have length 7 and the hypotenuse has length $7\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, the perimeter of the triangle is $7+7+7\sqrt{2} = \boxed{14+7\sqrt{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $ABCD$ be the original square and let $E$ be the point where the paper was folded so that $AE = AD$ and $BE = BC$. Then triangles $ABE$ and $ADE$ are congruent, so $[ABE] = [ADE]$. Also, $AB = AD = 7$, so the area of each triangle is $[ABE] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot BE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7 \cdot \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{49}{2\sqrt{2}}$. 

Let $F$ be the midpoint of $BC$, so that $BF = FC = \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}}$. Then $AE = AF + EF = AF + FC = AF + BF$, so $AF = AE - BF = 7 - \frac{7}{\sqrt{2}} = 7\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right)$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $EF = \sqrt{AE^2 - AF^2} = 7\sqrt{2} - 7$. 

Therefore, the perimeter of one of the triangles is $AE + EF + EA = 7\sqrt{2} + 7\left(\sqrt{2}-1\right) + 7\sqrt{2} - 7 = \boxed{14\sqrt{2}}$ inches.

The first prime number is $2$ and we know that all prime numbers after that must be odd. $3$, $5$, and $7$ are prime because their only positive integer divisors are $1$ and themselves. $9$ is divisible by $3$ so it is not prime. $11$ and $13$ are prime, but $15$ is not because it is divisible by $3$ and $5$. Continuing, $17$ and $19$ are prime, but $21$ isn't because it is divisible by $3$ and $7$. Finally we know that $23$ is prime.

To sum these nine numbers quicker, we can group them so that they sum to multiples of $10$: \begin{align*}

Notice that the first square, $1,$ has one digit, the next eight squares have two digits each, and the next sixty-four squares have three digits each.  This accounts for $1 + 8\cdot2 + 64\cdot3 = 201$ digits.  The remaining $2500 - 201 = 2299$ squares are four-digit numbers.  Since $4\cdot99^2 = 396$ and $4\cdot100^2 = 400,$ there are $100 - 1 = 99$ four-digit perfect squares.  Thus, the remaining $2299 - 99\cdot4 = 163$ digits come from the perfect squares between $31^2 = 961$ and $99^2 = 9801.$  Since ten digits are used for each of the $69$ numbers in the list $10,11,\ldots,78,79,$ and six digits are used for each of the $9$ numbers $961, 1024, \ldots, 1296,$ we need $10\cdot69 + 6\cdot9 = 744$ more digits.

Suppose the 3 different prime factors are $a$, $b$, and $c$.  The prime powers in the prime factorization of a perfect square must have even exponents.  Since the square must be as small as possible, we let the exponents all be 2, so the prime factorization is $a^2b^2c^2$.  We make the square as small as possible by letting the three primes be 2, 3, and 5, so we have \[a^2b^2c^2 = 2^2\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 = (2\cdot 3\cdot 5)^2 = 30^2 =\boxed{900}.\]

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/2058_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by trying to express the desired perfect square in terms of its prime factors. Let the perfect square be $n^2$ and its prime factors be $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$. Then we have $n^2 = p_1p_2p_3$. Since $n^2$ is a perfect square, it must have an even power of each prime factor in its prime factorization. Therefore, each of $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ must appear with an even exponent in the prime factorization of $n^2$, which means that each must appear with a multiple of 2 in the prime factorization of $n$. Without loss of generality, assume that $p_1<p_2<p_3$, then we can write $n = p_1a^2p_2b^2p_3c^2$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Then $n^2 = p_1^2a^4p_2^2b^4p_3^2c^4$.

Now we need to find the smallest values of $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ such that $n^2$ is a perfect square. The smallest prime is 2, so we can use that as $p_1$. The next smallest prime is 3, so we can use that as $p_2$. If we used 5 as $p_3$, then $n^2 = 2^2\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^2a^4b^4c^4$. However, since we want $n^2$ to be the least perfect square with 3 different prime factors, we should try to use a smaller prime. The next smallest prime is 7, so we can use that as $p_3$. Then $n^2 = 2^2\cdot 3^2\cdot 7^2a^4b^4c^4 = (2\cdot 3\cdot 7abc)^2$.

Therefore, the smallest perfect square with 3 different prime factors is $(2\cdot 3\cdot 7)^2 = \boxed{588}$.

Since each 1/2 inch represents 20 miles, we can set up a proportion to find out how many inches represent 120 miles:

$$\frac{1/2 \text{ inch}}{20 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ miles}}$$

Solving for $x$:

$$x = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles}/(1/2 \text{ inch})} = \boxed{6 \text{ inches}}$$

Therefore, two cities that are 120 miles apart would be 6 inches apart on the map.

The first computer backs up data every $5$ minutes, and the second computer backs up data every $2$ minutes. In other words, the first computer backs up data at times $5n$, and the second computer backs up data at times $2m$, where $n$ and $m$ are positive integers.

Therefore, the two computers back up data at the same time when $5n=2m$. To find the number of times they back up data at the same time in 24 hours, we simply count the number of solutions to $5n=2m$ such that $n$ and $m$ are positive integers and $m$ is not greater than $24\cdot60$ (since we are counting the number of times in 24 hours).

We can rearrange $5n=2m$ to get $m=\frac{5}{2}n$. Since $m$ must be a positive integer, $n$ must be even. Thus, we can let $n=2k$ for some positive integer $k$, and we get $m=5k$.

Since we want $m$ to be less than or equal to $24\cdot60=1440$, we must have $k$ less than or equal to $288$. Thus, the possible values for $k$ are $1,2,\ldots,288$, giving us a total of $\boxed{288}$ times.

To make the distance between exit $47$ and exit $48$ as long as possible, we want to make the distance between any other two consecutive exits as short as possible (that is, $6$ km). There are nine distances between exits from exit $41$ to exit $50$; eight that we want to make as short as possible and one that we want to make as long as possible. Thus, the longest possible distance is $100 - 8 \cdot 6 = \boxed{52}$ km.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the total distance between exits 41 and 50: $100 \text{ km}$. We also know that each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, so the total minimum distance between 41 and 50 is $9 \cdot 6\text{ km}=54\text{ km}$. Therefore, we know that exits 41 and 50 are at the ends of this range, with each of the other 7 exits spaced evenly in between.

To find the longest possible distance between exits 47 and 48, we want them to be at opposite ends of this range of 7 exits. Since there are an odd number of exits in this range, one of the exits must be in the middle. Therefore, there are 3 exits on each side of the middle exit. We want the middle exit to be as close as possible to exit 47 (without being exit 47). This means that exits 45, 46, and 47 are on one side, and exits 48, 49, and 50 are on the other.

The distance between exits 47 and 48 is equal to the total distance between exits 41 and 50 minus the sum of the distances between exits 41-45, 45-47, 48-50, and 50-41 (which is just the distance between exits 47 and 48, but we don't know that yet). Using the fact that each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, we can find each of these distances:

\begin{align*}
&41-45: 4 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 24 \text{ km} \\
&45-47: 2 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 12 \text{ km} \\
&48-50: 2 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 12 \text{ km} \\
&50-41: 9 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 54 \text{ km}
\end{align*}

The total of these distances is $24+12+12+54=102 \text{ km}$. Therefore, the longest possible distance between exits 47 and 48 is $100-102=-2 \text{ km}$. However, this is not a valid answer since distances cannot be negative. This means that our assumption that exits 45, 46, and 47 are on one side and exits 48, 49, and 50 are on the other side is incorrect.

Instead, we try a different configuration where exits 44, 45, 46, and 47 are on one side, and exits 48, 49, and 50 are on the other side. The distance between exits 47 and 48 is now equal to the total distance between exits 41 and 50 minus the sum of the distances between exits 41-44, 44-47, 48-50, and 50-41. Again using the fact that each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit, we can find each of these distances:

\begin{align*}
&41-44: 3 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 18 \text{ km} \\
&44-47: 3 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 18 \text{ km} \\
&48-50: 2 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 12 \text{ km} \\
&50-41: 9 \cdot 6 \text{ km} = 54 \text{ km}
\end{align*}

The total of these distances is $18+18+12+54=102 \text{ km}$. Therefore, the longest possible distance between exits 47 and 48 is $100-102=-2 \text{ km}$. Again, this is not a valid answer since distances cannot be negative. 

This means that the assumption that each exit is at least 6 km from the next exit is incorrect. In reality, each exit is not exactly 6 km from the next exit, but at least 6 km. Therefore, it's possible that some exits are further apart than others, and exits 47 and 48 could still be as far apart as possible. 

To see this, imagine that exits 41-47 are spaced evenly with a distance slightly larger than 6 km, and exits 48-50 are spaced evenly with a distance slightly smaller than 6 km. Then exits 45-47 would be on one side of the middle exit, and exits 48-50 would be on the other side, giving us the maximum distance between exits 47 and 48. However, it's not clear what the exact distance would be without more information about the spacing of the exits. 

Therefore, the longest possible distance between exit 47 and exit 48 is still undetermined.

Because $\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle, $\angle ABC = 45^\circ$.  Since $\angle ADB = 90^\circ$, we know that $\angle DAB = 45^\circ$, so $\triangle ABD$ is also a 45-45-90 triangle.  Similarly, $\triangle ACD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Therefore, $DB=DC = DA = 6$, so $BC = BD+DC = 12$, and  \[[ABC] = \frac{(AD)(BC)}{2} = \frac{(6)({12})}{2} = \boxed{36}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we can use the given ratios to find the relationship between daps and baps:

4 daps = 7 yaps
5 yaps = 3 baps

Combining these ratios, we can find the relationship between daps and baps:

4 daps = 7 yaps = (7/5) * 5 yaps = (7/5) * 3 baps
4 daps = (21/5) baps

So, 1 dap is equal to (21/20) baps.

To find how many daps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion:

4 daps / 42 baps = x daps / 1

Simplifying, we get:

4x = 42
x = 10.5

Therefore, 10.5 daps are equal to 42 baps.

If a multiple of $6$ is also a multiple of $8$, then it is a common multiple of $6$ and $8$.

Prime factorizing $6$ and $8$, we have $6=2\cdot3$ and $8=2^3$. To find a common multiple of $6$ and $8$, we take the product of the maximum power of each prime that appears in the prime factorizations of $6$ and $8$. The maximum power of $2$ that appears in either factorization is $2^3$ (the highest power of $2$ that appears in the prime factorization of $8$), and the maximum power of $3$ that appears in the prime factorizations is $3^1$. Therefore, the least common multiple of $6$ and $8$ is $$2^3\cdot3^1 = 24.$$The smallest positive multiple of $6$ that is also a multiple of $8$ is $\boxed{24}$.

We know that one dragonfruit is $x-4$ dollars.  This means that one rambutan is $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars.  Then, one starfruit is $(3x-4) -5 = 3x-9$ dollars. We want to find $1 \cdot (3x-4) + 2 \cdot (3x-9) + 3 \cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$. Finally, we combine like terms, yielding $(3x + 6x + 3x) + (-4 + -18 + -12) = (12x) + (-34)$.  We obtain $\boxed{12x -34}$, or $\boxed{-34 + 12x}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Start by using the conversion factor between ballops and fallops:

3 ballops = 11 fallops

Solve for ballops by dividing both sides by 3:

1 ballop = (11/3) fallops

Now use the conversion factor between wallops and ballops:

6 wallops = 5 ballops

Replace ballops with its equivalent in fallops:

6 wallops = 5 × (11/3) fallops

Simplify by multiplying:

6 wallops = 55/3 fallops

Finally, to find how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops, set up a proportion:

6 wallops / (55/3 fallops) = x wallops / 110 fallops

Solve for x by cross-multiplying:

6 wallops × 110 fallops = (55/3 fallops) × x wallops

Simplify:

660 wallops = (55/3) x wallops

Divide both sides by (55/3):

660 wallops ÷ (55/3) = x wallops

Simplify:

36 wallops = x wallops

Therefore, 110 fallops is equivalent to 36 wallops.

The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so each of the interior angles of regular pentagon $FGHIJ$ has measure $540^\circ / 5 = 108^\circ$.  Specifically, $\angle JFG = 108^\circ$, so \[\angle AFJ = 180^\circ - \angle JFG = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ.\]  Similarly, we have $\angle AJF = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ$.  Finally, the angles of $\triangle AFJ$ sum to $180^\circ$, so \[\angle FAJ = 180^\circ - \angle AFJ - \angle AJF = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 72^\circ = \boxed{36^\circ}.\]

Since $\overline{JH}\parallel\overline{AB}$, we have that $\angle JHI=\angle A$, and similarly $\angle IHG=\angle GHI=\angle IGF=\angle FGH$. All three angles in $\triangle FGH$ add up to $180^\circ$, so each has measure $60^\circ$. This means that $\angle IGF=60^\circ$, which in turn means that pentagon $FGHIJ$ has perimeter $5\times GF$, and angles at $G$ and $H$ each measuring $108^\circ$. Thus $\angle JHI=\angle A=\tfrac{1}{2}(180^\circ-108^\circ)=\boxed{36^\circ}$.

First, we figure out how many nights it takes for every meerkat to stand guard with every other meerkat exactly once. There are $10$ possibilities for the first guard and $9$ possibilities for the second guard, making $10\cdot 9$ pairs; but this actually counts each pair twice (since it doesn't matter which guard is "first" and which is "second"). So, the number of nights in one complete period is $(10\cdot 9)/2$, which is $45$.

During that period, each meerkat has to stand guard for $9$ nights. So, each meerkat gets $\boxed{36}$ nights of sleep.

Alternative solution: Let's say we want to know how many nights of sleep a particular meerkat (let's call him Max) gets. This is equal to the number of pairs of meerkats that don't include Max. To form such a pair, we can choose the first (non-Max) meerkat in $9$ ways and the second in $8$ ways, but again, this overcounts by a factor of $2$. The number of pairs without Max is thus $(9\cdot 8)/2$, which is $\boxed{36}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first count the number of pairs of meerkats that can stand guard together. This is just the number of ways to choose 2 meerkats out of 10, which is $\binom{10}{2}=45$. 

Now, consider a single meerkat. We know that this meerkat must stand guard with 9 other meerkats, since they cannot stand guard with themselves. Each of these 9 pairs of meerkats will stand guard together on some night during the period. Therefore, this meerkat will stand guard on 9 nights.

Since every meerkat is equivalent to every other meerkat, each meerkat will stand guard on 9 nights. This means that each meerkat will sleep during the remaining 41 nights of the period. 

Therefore, each meerkat gets $\boxed{41}$ nights of sleep during this period.

Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. Then the area of the circle is $\pi r^2$. Since central angle $a$ cuts off $\frac13$ of the circle, we have $$a = \frac{1}{3}\times 360^\circ = 120^\circ,$$and similarly $b=90^\circ$ and $c=60^\circ$. We can find the areas of each of the regions as follows: $$\begin{aligned} \text{Region }a &\implies \frac12 r^2\cdot 2\pi\cdot \frac13 = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 \\ \text{Region }b &\implies \frac12 r^2\cdot 2\pi\cdot\frac14 = \frac14\pi r^2 \\ \text{Region }c &\implies \frac12 r^2\cdot 2\pi\cdot\frac16 = \frac{1}{6}\pi r^2 \end{aligned}$$Let the area of the region cut out by central angle $d$ be $A$. Then $A = \pi r^2 - \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 - \frac14\pi r^2 - \frac16\pi r^2 = \frac{5}{12}\pi r^2$. Thus, the fraction of the area of the circle cut out by central angle $d$ is $${A\over\pi r^2} = \frac{5}{12}.$$Since the sum of the fractions of the area cut out by $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ is 1, we have $$\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{5}{12} = 1,$$so $$\frac{39}{12} = 1.$$Solving for $d$, we have $$d = 360^\circ - a - b - c = 360^\circ - 120^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = \boxed{90^\circ}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
If we let the first, second, and third persons' score equal $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively, then their team's score is $((a \cdot b)-c)$.  We may test all six possible orderings:
$a = 5$, $b = -2$, $c = 3 \rightarrow ((5 \cdot (-2)) - 3) = -13$
$a = -2$, $b = 5$, $c = 3 \rightarrow (((-2) \cdot 5) - 3) = -13$
$a = 5$, $b = 3$, $c = -2 \rightarrow ((5 \cdot 3) - (-2)) = 17$
$a = 3$, $b = 5$, $c = -2 \rightarrow ((3 \cdot 5) - (-2)) = 17$
$a = 3$, $b = -2$, $c = 5 \rightarrow ((3 \cdot (-2)) - 5) = -11$
$a = -2$, $b = 3$, $c = 5 \rightarrow (((-2) \cdot 3) - 5) = -11$
Thus, our total answer is $\boxed{17}$
Additionally, we may note that the only way to obtain a positive answer is to multiply the two positive scores together and subtract the negative score.  Because multiplication is commutative, the order of $a$ and $b$ does not matter, and we need only compute the single case $(3 \cdot 5) - (-2) = \boxed{17}$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the first person A, the second person B, and the third person C. We want to maximize the score, which is calculated as AB - C.

Since Sarah always earns points and Matthew always loses points, it makes sense to have Sarah and Matthew play first and second, but we need to determine which order. If Sarah plays first and Matthew plays second, their score would be:

AB - C = (5)(-2) - 3 = -13

However, if Matthew plays first and Sarah plays second, their score would be:

AB - C = (-2)(5) - 3 = -13

So it doesn't matter which order Sarah and Matthew play in, their score will always be -13. Therefore, the best strategy is to have James play last, so that his positive score can offset the negative score of AB:

AB - C = (-13) + 3 = -10

So the maximum possible score their team can earn is -10 points.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/375_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by using algebra to solve this problem. Let n be the number of nickels Dawn has, d be the number of dimes she has, and q be the number of quarters she has. We can set up three equations based on the information given:

1. Each nickel is paired with one dime:
n = d

2. Each dime is paired with one quarter:
d = q

3. The total value of the coins is $1.20:
0.05n + 0.10d + 0.25q = 1.20

We can use the first two equations to substitute for d and q in terms of n:

d = n
q = d = n

Substituting these into the third equation, we get:

0.05n + 0.10n + 0.25n = 1.20

Simplifying this expression, we get:

0.40n = 1.20

Dividing both sides by 0.40, we get:

n = 3

So Dawn has 3 nickels, 3 dimes, and 3 quarters. The total number of coins she has is:

3 + 3 + 3 = 9

Therefore, Dawn has 9 coins in total.

If a rhombus has a perimeter of 68 units, then its side length must be 17. Since diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, the right triangle that is formed has one leg of length 15 and another leg of length 8. Therefore, the area of one of the right triangles is $\frac{8 \times 15}{2} = 60$, so since the rhombus is made up of four congruent right triangles, the area of the rhombus is $60 \times 4 = \boxed{240}$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be the side lengths of the rhombus, and let $d$ be the length of the given diagonal. We know that the perimeter is $68$, so $4a = 68$, or $a = 17$. Since a rhombus is symmetric, the two diagonals have the same length. We also know that one diagonal is $30$, so the other diagonal must also be $30$. Let $e$ be the length of the other diagonal. We can find $e$ using the Pythagorean Theorem: $$e = \sqrt{30^2 - \left( \frac{17}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{900 - \frac{289}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{4811}}{2}.$$ Now we can find the area of the rhombus using the formula $A = \frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2$: $$A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{4811}}{2} = \boxed{225\sqrt{53}} \approx 1055.1.$$

We can use proportions to solve this problem. Let's call the length of the flagpole's shadow "x". Then we can set up the following proportion:

(Length of woman's shadow) : (Distance from woman to flagpole) = (Length of flagpole's shadow) : (Distance from flagpole to end of its shadow)

Plugging in the given values, we get:

6 : 5 = x : 15

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

6 * 15 = 5 * x
90 = 5x
x = 18

Therefore, the length of the flagpole's shadow is 18 feet.

Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by using variables to represent our unknowns. Let B be the current age of my brother and I be my current age. 

We know that B = 4I, since my brother is 4 times as old as I am. 

We also know that six years from now, my brother will be twice as old as I will be. So, we can set up an equation: 

B + 6 = 2(I + 6) 

We want to solve for B, so let's use the first equation to substitute for I: 

B + 6 = 2(4I + 6) 

B + 6 = 8I + 12 

Substituting B = 4I: 

4I + 6 = 8I + 12 

Subtracting 4I from both sides: 

6 = 4I + 12 

Subtracting 12 from both sides: 

-6 = 4I 

Dividing both sides by 4: 

I = -1.5 

Uh oh, it looks like we have a problem. If my age is negative, then this makes no sense. We must have made a mistake along the way. 

Let's double check our equation B + 6 = 2(I + 6). It looks correct, but let's rewrite it using our expression for B in terms of I: 

4I + 6 = 2(I + 6) 

Expanding the right side: 

4I + 6 = 2I + 12 

Subtracting 2I from both sides: 

2I + 6 = 12 

Subtracting 6 from both sides: 

2I = 6 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

I = 3 

Ah, that looks better. If I am 3 years old, then my brother is 4 times as old, which makes him 12. 

To check our work, let's plug in these values to the other equation: 

B + 6 = 2(I + 6) 

12 + 6 = 2(3 + 6) 

18 = 2(9) 

18 = 18 

The equation checks out, so our answer is correct. My brother is currently 12 years old.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are four Queens and 13 $\diamondsuit$s in a standard deck, but we cannot simply add these quantities to get the total number of cards that are Queens or $\diamondsuit$s or both.  This is because there is one card, the Queen of $\diamondsuit$s, that is both a Queen and a $\diamondsuit$.  Therefore, we have to subtract one from the total count.  So the total number of cards that are either Queens or $\diamondsuit$s or both is $4+13-1=16$.  Since there are 52 cards in the deck, the probability that a randomly chosen card is a Queen or a $\diamondsuit$ (or both) is $$\frac{16}{52}=\boxed{\frac{4}{13}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To get a sum of 4, the only possible rolls are 1 and 3 or 2 and 2.  The probability of rolling a 1 on one die is $\frac16$, and the probability of rolling a 3 on the other die is also $\frac16$, so the probability of rolling a 1 and a 3 is $\frac16\cdot\frac16=\frac{1}{36}$.  Similarly, the probability of rolling two 2's is also $\frac{1}{36}$.  So, the probability of rolling a sum of 4 is $\frac{1}{36}+\frac{1}{36}=\boxed{\frac{1}{18}}$.

Alternatively, since $405$ is odd, we know that we can ignore any factors of $2$ in $144$. Dividing by $2$ repeatedly, we find that $144/2^4 = 9$. Since $9$ divides into $405$, it follows that the greatest common factor is $9$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/458_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To find the greatest common length that the ropes can be cut into, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 24. 

One way to find the GCD is to list all the factors of each number and then find the greatest one they have in common. 

Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

The greatest common factor of 18 and 24 is 6. Therefore, the ropes can be cut into pieces that are 6 meters in length. 

To check: 
- The 18-meter rope can be cut into 3 pieces of 6 meters each. 
- The 24-meter rope can be cut into 4 pieces of 6 meters each. 

So, the greatest possible length of each piece is 6 meters.

We begin by noting that    $$\frac{31}{11111} = \frac{31 \times 9}{11111 \times 9} = \frac{279}{99999}.$$We will show that   $$\frac{279}{99999} = 0.\overline{00279},$$so our final answer is $\boxed{5}.$

Proof that $279/99999 = 0.\overline{00279}$:

Let $s = 0.\overline{00279}$. Then multiplying both sides $10^5$ gives   $$10^5 s = 279.\overline{00279}.$$Subtracting the left side by $s$ and the right side by $0.\overline{00279}$ gives   $$99999s = 279,$$so $s = 279/99999$. It follows that $0.\overline{00279} = 279 / 99999,$ as desired.

Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$. We can apply the Pythagorean Theorem to two sides of this rectangle and get that the length of the diagonal is $5\sqrt{5}=\sqrt{w^2+(2w)^2}=\sqrt{5 w^2}$. We therefore have $5\sqrt{5} = w\sqrt{5}$, which means that $w=5$. This means that the length of the rectangle is 10, so its area is $5\cdot10=\boxed{50}$.

Let the width of the rectangle be $w$. Then the length of the rectangle is $2w$. Let $d$ be the diagonal of the rectangle. Then we have the equations $d^2=w^2+(2w)^2$ and $d=5\sqrt{5}$.

Substituting $d=5\sqrt{5}$ into the first equation, we get \begin{align*}
(5\sqrt{5})^2 &= w^2+(2w)^2 \\
125 &= 5w^2 \\
w^2 &= 25 \\
w &= 5.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the length of the rectangle is $2w=10$. The area of the rectangle is $A=wl=5\cdot 10=\boxed{50}$.

Let the four distinct positive integers be $a$, $b$, $c$, and 13, with $a<b<c<13$. We have the equation $\frac{a+b+c+13}{4}=5\Rightarrow a+b+c=7$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ must be positive and distinct, $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=4$. So the smallest integer is $\boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the four integers be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$, with $a<b<c<d$. We know that $d=13$, and we know that the mean of these four numbers is $5$. The mean is defined as the sum of the numbers divided by the number of numbers, so we have $$\frac{a+b+c+d}{4}=5.$$Substituting $d=13$, we get $$\frac{a+b+c+13}{4}=5.$$Multiplying both sides by 4, we get $$a+b+c+13=20.$$Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get $$a+b+c=7.$$Since $a<b<c$, we have $a\leq 2$, and the only way to get a sum of 7 with distinct positive integers is $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=4$. Therefore, the four integers are 1, 2, 4, and 13, with 1 being the smallest integer. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
At 3:20, the hour hand is pointing at the 3 and the minute hand is pointing at the 4. 

The hour hand moves 360 degrees in 12 hours, so in one hour it moves 30 degrees (360/12). At 3:20, the hour hand has moved 3 hours and 20 minutes past 3, which is equivalent to 3.33 hours. Therefore, the hour hand has moved 3.33 x 30 = 99.9 degrees from the 3. 

The minute hand moves 360 degrees in 60 minutes, so in one minute it moves 6 degrees (360/60). At 20 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 20 x 6 = 120 degrees. 

The acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand is the smaller of the two angles formed by the two hands. We can find this angle by subtracting the larger angle (in this case, the angle formed by the minute hand) from 360 degrees. 

So, the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand is 360 - 120 = 240 degrees.

The positive multiples of $63$ are $63$, $126$, $189$, .... All of these numbers except for $63$ are bigger than $63.$ On the other hand, all the positive factors of $63$ other than $63$ are less than $63.$ So if Marie and Jay are thinking of the same positive number, that number must be $63.$

By the same reasoning, the list $-63$, $-126$, $-189$, ..., of negative multiples cannot include any factors of $63$ except $-63$. Thus the two possible values for the number Marie and Jay are thinking of are $-63$ and $63.$ The product of these two numbers is $(-63)(63)=\boxed{-3969}$, since the product of a positive number and negative number is negative.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/527_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We know that $63=3^2\cdot 7$, so a multiple of 63 must be in the form $3^a\cdot7^b$ where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers. Meanwhile, a factor of 63 must be in the form $3^c\cdot7^d$ where $0\leq c\leq 2$ and $0\leq d\leq 1$.

Since our final quantity involves multiplication, we can consider the prime factorizations of each of the numbers that Marie and Jay are thinking of separately. If the product of these two numbers is negative, that must mean one is negative and the other is positive. Thus, we can look at two cases:

Case 1: The number is positive.

This means that both $a$ and $b$ in the multiple are nonnegative, and both $c$ and $d$ in the factor are nonnegative. Since the two must be equal, we have $$3^a\cdot 7^b = 3^c\cdot 7^d.$$ Since $b=0$ or $1$ and $d=0$ or $1$, there are only four possible combinations to check: $(b,d)=(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)$.

If $(b,d)=(0,0)$, then $a=c=0$, giving us $1$ as a possibility.
If $(b,d)=(1,0)$, then $a=c=2$, giving us $81$ as a possibility.
If $(b,d)=(0,1)$, then $a=c=1$, giving us $7$ as a possibility.
If $(b,d)=(1,1)$, then $a=c=3$, giving us $343$ as a possibility.

Thus, the possible positive numbers are $1$, $7$, $81$, and $343$.

Case 2: The number is negative.

This means that exactly one of $a$ and $b$ is odd, while exactly one of $c$ and $d$ is odd. Since we want the product to be negative, we must have one odd and one even number.

First, suppose $a$ is odd (and thus $b$ is even). Then, $c=2$ and $d=1$ since the factor must have exactly one odd value. We have $$3^a\cdot7^b = 3^2\cdot7.$$ Equivalently, $$3^{a-2}\cdot7^{b-1}=1.$$ Since the left-hand side is an integer, we must have $a=3$ and $b=0$. This means the positive number is $7$, so the negative number is $-7$.

Finally, suppose $b$ is odd (and thus $a$ is even). Then, $c=1$ and $d=1$ since the factor must have exactly one odd value. We have $$3^a\cdot7^b = 3\cdot7,$$ which gives $a=1$ and $b=1$. This means the positive number is $21$, so the negative number is $-21$.

Thus, the possible negative numbers are $-7$ and $-21$.

Our answer is the product of all these numbers, namely $1\cdot 7\cdot 81\cdot 343\cdot (-7)\cdot(-21)=\boxed{-642753}$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $N$ be the number in question, and let $a$ be the tens digit of $N$. Then $N = 10a$, and the digit sum of $N$ is simply $a$, which is divisible by $3$. Hence $a = 3, 6$, or $9$. Moreover, all of $2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$ divide $N$ if and only if $N$ is divisible by $8$, or $a$ is even, while $3$ and $9$ divide $N$ if and only if $N$ is divisible by $9$, or $a$ is a multiple of $3$. Therefore, the divisors of $N$ are precisely $\boxed{2, 4, 6, 8}$ if $a = 6$, and $\boxed{3, 6, 9}$ if $a = 9$.

We have:

\text{Multiples of } 1 & 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, \ldots \\ \hline
\text{Multiples of } 2 & 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, \ldots \\ \hline

\text{Multiples of } 7 & 7, 14, 21, \ldots \\ \hline
\end{array}$

The prime factorization of $8$ is $2^3$. Therefore, in order to create an integer that is a multiple of all numbers from $1$ to $7$, we need to consider a multiple of $2$ in the form of $2^3$, a multiple of $3$, $5$, and $7$. Thus, the least common multiple of all integers from $1$ to $7$ is $2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 = \boxed{420}$.

In order for a number to be divisible by $4$, the last two digits have to be divisible by $4$. If the units digit is $2$, the $2$-digit numbers which are divisible by $4$ are $12$, $32$, $52$, $72$, and $92$. Thus the last two digits must be one of these $5$ possibilities. There are two possibilities for the digit in the hundreds place: it could be $0$, meaning the number is a $2$-digit number, or it could be $1$. Any greater value in the hundreds place will make the number greater than $200$. So the total number is $(2)(5)=\boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $n$ be the least positive integer divisible by each of the first five composite numbers, namely 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The prime factorization of the number $n$ must include all of the primes less than or equal to 10, as well as a factor of 9. Thus, we write $n=2^a3^b5^c7^d\cdot9$ for some non-negative integers $a,b,c,$ and $d$.

Since we want to minimize $n$, we choose the smallest possible values for $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that satisfy the condition that $n$ is divisible by each of the first five composite numbers. Since $n$ is divisible by 4, we must have $a\geq2$. Since $n$ is divisible by 6, we must have $a\geq1$ and $b\geq1$. Since $n$ is divisible by 8, we must have $a\geq3$ and $b\geq1$. Since $n$ is divisible by 9, we must have $a\geq2$ and $b\geq2$. Finally, since $n$ is divisible by 10, we must have $a\geq1$ and $c\geq1$.

We can solve this with a Venn diagram.  First we notice that there are 20 people with both yoga mats and water bottles. [asy]
label("Yoga Mat", (2,75));
label("Water Bottle", (80,75));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));
draw(Circle((58, 45), 22));

//label(scale(0.8)*"$23$",(63,45));
//label(scale(0.8)*"$17$", (70, 15));
[/asy] Since 36 people brought yoga mats and 20 of those people brought water bottles too, $36-20=16$ of the people have yoga mats but not water bottles.  Likewise, $26-20=6$ people brought water bottles but not yoga mats. [asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that:

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

where |A| represents the number of elements in set A. In this case, we want to find the number of people who did not bring a yoga mat or a water bottle, which is the complement of the set of people who brought at least one of these items. Therefore:

|#(no mat or bottle)| = |#(all)| - |#(mat or bottle)|

where #(all) is the total number of people in the class (42) and #(mat or bottle) is the number of people who brought at least one of these items.

To find #(mat or bottle), we add the number of people who brought yoga mats to the number of people who brought eco-friendly water bottles, and then subtract the number of people who brought both, since we counted them twice. Therefore:

#(mat or bottle) = #(mat) + #(bottle) - #(mat and bottle)

where #(mat) = 36, #(bottle) = 26, and #(mat and bottle) = 20. Substituting these values, we get:

#(mat or bottle) = 36 + 26 - 20 = 42

Therefore, the number of people who did not bring a yoga mat or a water bottle is:

|#(no mat or bottle)| = |#(all)| - |#(mat or bottle)| = 42 - 42 = 0

So, no one had to suffer through class without a yoga mat or a water bottle!

First, we need to find out how many cartons of milk a junior drinks per day on average. 

1500 cartons per 5-day week = 300 cartons per day (divided by 5) 

So, each junior drinks an average of 300/450 = 0.67 cartons per day. 

If the seniors drink at the same rate, then we can assume each senior also drinks 0.67 cartons per day. 

600 seniors x 0.67 cartons per day = 402 cartons of milk per day 

Therefore, the average number of total cartons of milk the 600 seniors drink each school day is 402.

Let the center point be $H$. $ADH$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Since $ABCD$ has area $16$, $AD$ has length $4$.  So $DH$ has length $\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}}=2\sqrt{2}$.  Let the marked points on $DH$ and $DC$ be $F$ and $G$ respectively.  Since angle $ADH$ is $45^{\circ}$, so is angle $FDG$.  Thus, since $e$ is a square, triangle $DFG$ is an isosceles right triangle.  Thus $HF=DF=FG$.

Since $DH=2\sqrt{2}$, these are equal to $\sqrt{2}$.  So $DG$ has length $2$, and as $CD$ has length $4$ this means that $CG$ has length $2$.  Since angle $FGD$ is $45^{\circ}$ and $e$ is a square, if we label the marked point on $BC$ as $J$ then angle $CGJ$ is $45^{\circ}$.

Thus triangle $CGJ$, the grey piece, is an isosceles right triangle, and one of its legs is $2$, so its area is $\frac{2^2}{2}=\boxed{2}$.

We can use the fact that the area of square $ABCD$ is 16 to find the lengths of the sides of the square and the gray piece. Since $ABCD$ has area 16 square inches, each side of it has length $\sqrt{16}=4$ inches. Also, we see that $e$ has twice the area of a 45-45-90 triangle with legs of length $1$, so each side of $e$ has length $\sqrt{2}$.

label("$\sqrt{2}$",(2,0),NE);
label("$\sqrt{2}$",(4,2),SE);
[/asy]

Now we just need to find the area of the gray piece. We can do this by subtracting the areas of triangle $eFB$ and triangle $eGA$ from the area of square $ABCD$. 

The area of triangle $eFB$ is \[\frac{1}{2} \cdot FB \cdot eB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 4 = 2\sqrt{2}\] square inches, because it is half of square $eBCF$. 

Similarly, the area of triangle $eGA$ is \[\frac{1}{2} \cdot GA \cdot eA = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 4 = 2\sqrt{2}\] square inches.

There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the length of the rectangular section of floor is $36$ inches and its width is $24$ inches. It would take $36 \div 6 = 6$ tiles to cover the length of the floor and $24 \div 6 = 4$ tiles to cover the width, so a total of $6 \times 4 = \boxed{24}$ tiles are needed to cover the whole rectangular section of the floor.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to convert the measurements to the same units. Since the tiles are in inches and the rectangular section is in feet, let's convert the feet to inches. 

3 feet = 36 inches 
2 feet = 24 inches 

Now we can see that the rectangular section is 36 inches by 24 inches. 

Next, we need to figure out how many tiles will fit horizontally and vertically. 

Horizontally: 
Each tile is 6 inches wide, so we divide the width of the rectangular section (36 inches) by 6 inches: 

36 ÷ 6 = 6 

Vertically: 
Each tile is 6 inches long, so we divide the length of the rectangular section (24 inches) by 6 inches: 

24 ÷ 6 = 4 

Therefore, we need 6 tiles horizontally and 4 tiles vertically, for a total of: 

6 x 4 = 24 tiles. 

Answer: $\boxed{24}$.

The product $ab$ is odd, since both $a$ and $b$ are odd. Any even positive integer less than $ab$ must be less than $7\cdot 13$, and will therefore have at most one factor of $2$ in its prime factorization. There are $3$ odd integers less than $7$, and $6$ odd integers less than $13$, so there are $3\cdot 6=18$ positive integers less than $7\cdot 13$ that are divisible by $2$. Therefore, the number of even positive integers less than $ab$ is $\boxed{18}$.

We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{2}{5} - \frac{5}{12}.\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.

To get this common denominator for the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\frac{48}{120}$.

To get the common denominator for $\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{48}{120} - \frac{50}{120} = \frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \frac{22}{120}.\]Notice that $\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\frac{2\cdot11}{2\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$.

There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use the formula for the number of combinations of r items from n items, which is:

C(n, r) = n! / (r! (n - r)!)

In this case, we want to find the number of combinations of 2 out of 12 players (6 from each team), since a handshake involves two people. So we can plug in n = 12 and r = 2:

C(12, 2) = 12! / (2! (12 - 2)!) = 12 x 11 / 2 = 66

Therefore, there are 66 handshakes in total.

By the Pythagorean theorem, we have \begin{align*}

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the length of the other leg "x". Since the other two sides are consecutive integers, the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) will be "x+1".

We know that the Pythagorean Theorem applies to right triangles: the sum of the squares of the legs (the shorter sides) is equal to the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side). In this case, that means:

$9^2 + x^2 = (x+1)^2$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$81 + x^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$

Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get:

$81 = 2x + 1$

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

$80 = 2x$

Dividing by 2, we get:

$x = 40$

So the length of the other leg is 40 meters, and the length of the hypotenuse is 41 meters. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of all three sides:

$9 + 40 + 41 = 90$

So the perimeter of the triangle is 90 meters.

Let $x$ be the number of blue marbles added to the bag. After adding $x$ blue marbles, the total number of marbles in the bag is $20+x$, and the total number of blue marbles in the bag is $5+x$. The probability of selecting a blue marble at random is the ratio of the number of blue marbles to the total number of marbles, so we want:

$$\frac{5+x}{20+x}=\frac{1}{2}$$

To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply to get:

$$10+2x=5+x$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$x=\boxed{5}$$

Therefore, we need to add 5 blue marbles to the bag.

Instead, realize that when we multiply a small fraction like this by itself, the result is smaller than our original fraction. Then if we multiply that result by the original fraction again, the result will be even smaller. Now imagine if we do this $1000$ times.

Extracting Answer from: 
We have $\left(\frac{1}{23}\right)^{1000} = \frac{1^{1000}}{23^{1000}} = \frac{1}{23^{1000}}$. To estimate the size of this fraction, we can use the fact that $23^4 = 279\text{,}841$ is close to $3 \times 10^5$. This gives us $23^{8} \approx (3 \times 10^5)^2 = 9 \times 10^{10}$, $23^{12} \approx 23^8 \times 23^4 \approx 2.5 \times 10^{15}$, and $23^{16} \approx (23^{12})^2 \approx 6 \times 10^{30}$. Therefore, we have:
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{23^{1000}} &\approx \frac{1}{23^{16 \cdot 62 + 8}} \\
&= \frac{1}{(23^{16})^{62} \cdot 23^8} \\
&\approx \frac{1}{(6 \times 10^{30})^{62} \cdot 2.5 \times 10^{15}} \\
&= \frac{1}{(2 \times 10^{193}) \cdot (2.5 \times 10^{15})} \\
&= \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{208}}.

Thus, the expression $\left(\frac{1}{23} \right)^{1000}$ is closest to $\boxed{0}.$

We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\!321/3=\boxed{18,\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).

It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\overline{3}$: \[
10 \cdot .0\overline{3} = .\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow .0\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \div 10 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30}.
\]Next, $.\overline{03}$: \[
99 \cdot .\overline{03} = (100-1) \cdot .\overline{03} = 3.\overline{03} - .\overline{03} = 3\\
\Rightarrow .\overline{03} = \frac{3}{99} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 33} = \frac{1}{33}.
\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3} \div .\overline{03} &= \frac{1}{30} \div \frac{1}{33}= \frac{1}{30} \cdot \frac{33}{1}\\
&= \frac{33}{30} = \frac{3 \cdot 11}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{11}{10}\\
&= \frac{10+1}{10} = \boxed{1\frac{1}{10}}.

The formula for the area of a triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \text{base} \times \text{height}$.  Using this, we can find the length of $AB$, because we know the area of triangle $ABE$. $$6=\frac{1}{2}AB\times4$$$$12=AB\times4$$$$AB=3$$Since $AB=BC=CD$, $AC=2\times{AB}=6$.

To find $CE$, use the Pythagorean Theorem, treating $CE$ as the hypotenuse of triangle $ACE$. $$4^2+6^2=CE^2$$$$CE^2=52$$Then $CE = \sqrt{52}.$  Rounded to the nearest tenth, this is $\boxed{7.2}.$

Let $h$ denote the length of altitude $BG$ to $AE$. By symmetry, we know that the length of the altitude from $C$ to $AE$ is also $h$. Now, since $\triangle ABE$ is a 6-8-10 triangle, we have that $h=3$ and using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle ABE$ gives that $BE=8$. By the Pythagorean Theorem again, we can solve for $BD$ to be $2\sqrt{2}$, which gives $CD=2\sqrt{2}$ and $CE=6+\sqrt{8} \approx \boxed{9.8}$ units.

All of these numbers need to be rounded to the nearest tenth. To do this, we look at the places after the tenths place. We see two different endings: $0.05001$ and $0.04999.$ Because the $0.05001$ is greater than $0.05,$ we will round the tenths place up in numbers that end in this. In addition, because $0.04999$ is less than $0.05,$ numbers with this ending will be rounded down. Thus, after rounding according to these rules, we get

$\bullet$ A. $14.5$

$\bullet$ B. $14.5$

$\bullet$ C. $14.4$

$\bullet$ D. $14.6$

Let $n$ be the number of students at class.  Betty noticed that $n$ has no divisors between 1 and itself, so $n$ is prime.  Wilma noticed that $n + 2$ is prime.  This means we are looking for the smaller of two primes that differ by 2 that are between 30 and 50.  The primes in that range are 31, 37, 41, 43, and 47.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $n$ be the number of students who showed up. Since the students couldn't be divided into equal groups when Betty and Wilma left, the number of students must not have been divisible by $2$ or $3$. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $2$ or $3$, which means it must be congruent to $1, 5$ or $7$ modulo $12$ (since those are the residues that are not multiples of $2$ or $3$). 

Suppose there were $k$ groups when Betty and Wilma left. Then each group had $\frac{n}{k}$ students. Since the groups were not of equal size, this means $\frac{n}{k}$ is not an integer. However, we know that $\frac{n+2}{k+2}$ is an integer (since Betty and Wilma could join the students and form $k+2$ equal groups). Therefore, $\frac{n+2}{k+2}$ is greater than $\frac{n}{k}$ by at least $1$ (since the denominator increases but the numerator only increases by $2$). 

Thus, $$\frac{n+2}{k+2} - \frac{n}{k} = \frac{2k-2}{k(k+2)} \ge 1.$$ This simplifies to $2k-2 \ge k(k+2)$, which means $k^2 + k - 2 \le 0$. The only positive integer solution is $k=1$. Therefore, there was only one group, and everyone was shooting at the same target. 

We also know that $n$ is not divisible by $5$, since otherwise we could have formed groups of $5$. Therefore, $n$ must be congruent to $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8$ or $9$ modulo $10$. Since we have already limited $n$ to residues $1, 5$ and $7$ modulo $12$, we see that the only possible value of $n$ is $\boxed{37}$ (which is congruent to $1$ modulo $12$ and $7$ modulo $10$).

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by drawing a Venn diagram to represent the situation:

Let B be the set of students taking biology, S be the set of students taking Spanish, and U be the set of all students in the class. We know that:

|B| = 18   (the number of students in B)
|S| = 13   (the number of students in S)
|B ∩ S| = 5   (the number of students in both B and S)

We want to find |U| (the total number of students).

From the Venn diagram, we can see that:

|U| = |B| + |S| - |B ∩ S|

Substituting the given values, we get:

|U| = 18 + 13 - 5

|U| = 26

Therefore, there are 26 students in the homeroom class.

Let $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $e$ be the five integers in the set, so that $a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq e$. Since the median is 5, we know that $c=5$. Since the mean is also 5, we have $$\frac{a+b+c+d+e}{5}=5 \Rightarrow a+b+d+e=15.$$ The only mode is 8, so exactly two of the five integers must be equal to 8. Therefore, either $(a,b,d,e)=(8,8,1,4,4)$ or $(a,b,d,e)=(1,4,4,8,8)$. But since $b \leq c$ and $c=5$, it cannot be the case that $b=1$ in the second option.

Observing a small portion of the expression first, we have: $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{5}{9} = \frac{2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5}{5^2 \cdot 4^2 \cdot 9}$ by combining numerators and denominators through multiplication.  Then, by rearranging, we obtain: $\frac{4 \cdot 9 \cdot 5}{4^2 \cdot 9 \cdot 5^2} = \frac{4}{4^2} \cdot \frac{9}{9} \cdot \frac{5}{5^2} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{20}$.

Let the number be $x$. We know that $20\%$ of $x$ is equal to $12$, so we can set up the equation:

$$x=\frac{12}{0.2}=60$$

Therefore, our number is $60$. To find $30\%$ of $60$, we can set up another equation:

$$0.3\cdot60=18$$

We start by finding the reciprocal of $\frac{5}{6}$, which is $\frac{6}{5}$. To find the reciprocal of the reciprocal of $\frac{5}{6}$, we need to take the reciprocal of $\frac{6}{5}$. The reciprocal of $\frac{6}{5}$ is $\frac{5}{6}$, so the reciprocal of the reciprocal of $\frac{5}{6}$ is $\frac{5}{6}$.

Now we need to divide $\frac{6}{5}$ by $\frac{5}{6}$. We can do this by multiplying $\frac{6}{5}$ by the reciprocal of $\frac{5}{6}$, which is $\frac{6}{5}$. We get:

$$\frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} = \frac{36}{25}$$

To find the class average, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the total number of students:

Total score = (20*80) + (8*90) + (2*100) = 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520

Total number of students = 30

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that 1/32 of a gallon of ice cream can make one ice cream cone and that Izzy has 3/4 of a gallon of ice cream left. Therefore, to find the number of ice cream cones that Izzy can make, we have to find how many 1/32s there are in 3/4. This is the same as asking "what is 3/4 divided by 1/32?"

We also know that division by a fraction is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal. Since the reciprocal of $\frac{1}{32}$ is $\frac{32}{1}$, we have that $$\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{32} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{32}{1} = \frac{3 \cdot 32}{4 \cdot 1} = \frac{96}{4} = 24.$$Izzy can sell $\boxed{24}$ more ice cream cones.

Since there are $\frac{1}{32}$ of a gallon of ice cream in each cone, the number of cones that can be sold is equal to the number of $\frac{1}{32}$'s in $\frac{3}{4}$. We can find that by dividing $\frac{3}{4}$ by $\frac{1}{32}$: $$\frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{32} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{32}{1} = 24.$$ So Izzy can sell $\boxed{24}$ more ice cream cones.

A 10-by-12-inch paper will have an area of $10 \cdot 12 = 120$ square inches. If that paper has 1.5 inch margins on all sides, then the portion of the paper that is not covered by margins will be a rectangular section with length $12 - 2(1.5) = 9$ inches and width $10 - 2(1.5) = 7$ inches. Thus, $9 \cdot 7 = 63$ square inches of the paper will not be taken up by the margins. Since the paper has a total area of $120$ square in, this means that $120-63=57$ square inches of the page is taken up by margins. Thus, margins take up $\dfrac{57}{120}=\boxed{\dfrac{19}{40}}$ of the page.

The largest number Nancy can generate is 66.  The positive two-digit multiples of 8 less than 66 are 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, and 64.  40 and 48 cannot be produced from the numbers on a 6-sided die, but the other 5 multiples of 8 in the list can.  Therefore, there are 5 equally likely ways to produce a multiple of 8 out of the $6\cdot6=36$ total combinations for the two dice, so the desired probability is $\boxed{\dfrac{5}{36}}$.

For a number to be divisible by 8, its last three digits must be divisible by 8. So we need to find how many two-digit numbers can be generated that are divisible by 8.

The possible tens digits are $1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $6$. For each tens digit, there are two possible ones digits that result in a multiple of 8: $4$ and $8$. Therefore, there are $6\cdot 2 = 12$ possible two-digit numbers that are multiples of $8$. 

There are $6\cdot 6 = 36$ possible choices for the two dice rolls, so the probability of rolling a multiple of $8$ is $\dfrac{12}{36} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Since $SUR$ is a straight line, then $\angle RUV = 180^\circ - \angle SUV = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ$.

Since $UVW$ is a straight line, then $\angle RVU = 180^\circ - \angle RVW = 180^\circ - 112^\circ = 68^\circ$.

Since the measures of the angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, then \[ \angle URV = 180^\circ - \angle RUV - \angle RVU = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 68^\circ = \boxed{52^\circ}. \]

Extracting Answer from: 
Casework is unavoidable. However, we can tell that 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 will work because of their respective divisibility rules. (We know that 1 works because every integer is divisible by 1. We know that 2 works because any number with an even units digit is divisible by 2. We know that 3 works because the sum of the digits of $63$ is $6 + 3 = 9$, and 9 is divisible by 3. We know that 5 works because any number with a units digit of 5 is divisible by 5. We know that 6 works because $66$ is divisible by 2, since the units digit is even, and by 3, since $6 + 6 = 12$, and 12 is divisible by 3.)

The remaining digits are 0, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

No dividing by 0!  So, we can't have $n=0$.

Testing $n = 4$, we see that 64 is indeed divisible by 4.

Testing $n = 7$, we see by dividing that 67 is not divisible by 7.

Testing $n = 8$, we see by dividing that 68 is not divisible by 8.

Testing $n = 9$, we see using the divisibility rule for 9 that 69 is not divisible by 9 (since the sum of its digits is $6+9=15$ is not divisible by 9).

Thus, the answer is 1,2,3,4,5,6, which is $\boxed{6}$ digits.

The prime factorization of 48 is $2^4\cdot3$. Since the greatest common factor is 24, that means the other number also has the factors $2^3$ and 3 but not a fourth 2. When we divide 240 by 48, we get 5. The factors $2^3$ and 3 of the other number are covered by the factors of 48, but the factor 5 must come from the other number. So, the other number is $2^3\cdot3\cdot5=\boxed{120}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/864_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let the other integer be $x$. Then we know that $\text{lcm}(48,x) = 240$ and $\text{gcd}(48,x) = 24$. We can write $48=2^4\cdot 3$ and $x=2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot k$, where $k$ is not divisible by $2$ or $3$. 

Since the $\text{lcm}(48,x) = 240=2^4\cdot 3\cdot 5$, and $48$ already contains a factor of $2^4\cdot 3$, this means that $x$ must contain a factor of $5$. Therefore, $a\geq 1$. Similarly, we know that $\text{gcd}(48,x)=24=2^3\cdot 3$, which means that both $48$ and $x$ must have factors of $2^3$ and $3$. Therefore, $b\geq 1$ and $k$ is either $1$, $5$, or $5\cdot 7$ (since $k$ cannot have any factors of $2$ or $3$).

To find $x$, we just need to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $k$ that satisfy these conditions. Since $a\geq 1$ and $b\geq 1$, there are only a few cases to consider for $k$:

\begin{align*} x &= 2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 1 \\ x &= 2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 5 \\ x &= 2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 5\cdot 7 \end{align*}

We know that $\text{lcm}(48,x)=240$, so we can use this to solve for $a$, $b$, and $k$:

\begin{align*} \text{lcm}(48,x) &= 2^4\cdot 3\cdot 5 \\ 2^4\cdot 3\cdot 5 &= 2^4\cdot 3^1\cdot 5^1\cdot 1, \text{ if } x=2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 1 \\ 2^4\cdot 3\cdot 5 &= 2^4\cdot 3^1\cdot 5^1\cdot 5, \text{ if } x=2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 5 \\ 2^4\cdot 3\cdot 5 &= 2^4\cdot 3^2\cdot 5^1\cdot 7, \text{ if } x=2^a\cdot 3^b\cdot 5\cdot 7 \end{align*}

We can see that the third equation has no integer solutions, so we can ignore it. The first equation simplifies to $x=15$, but $x$ must be odd since it shares a factor of $2$ with $48$. Therefore, the only valid solution is $x=2\cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 30$. 

Therefore, the other integer is $\boxed{30}$.

We can set up a proportion using the ratio of shoe stores to total stores at the two malls:

North Area Mall: 18/90 = x/total number of stores
University Mall: 9/total number of stores = x/total number of stores

Simplifying these expressions, we get:

North Area Mall: 18/90 = x/total
University Mall: 9/total = x/total

We can then cross-multiply and solve for the total number of stores at University Mall:

North Area Mall: 18 total = 90x
x = 18/90 = 0.2

In total there are $53+8+155+17+145+10+98+2=488$ physicians of aerospace medicine. 45-54 year-old males account for $145/488$ of this population, so they should account for that fraction of the central angle of the circle graph also. Since there are 360 degrees in the central angle to divide up among the groups, the 45-54 year-old male group should get $\frac{145}{488}\cdot360\approx\boxed{107}$ degrees.

First, we determine the total number of physicians by adding up the totals in each group:

$53+8+155+17+145+10+98+2=488$

Next, we find the fraction of physicians in the "45-54 year-old Males" group by dividing 145 by the total:

$\frac{145}{488}$

To find the central angle of the sector, we multiply this fraction by 360 degrees:

$\frac{145}{488} \times 360^\circ \approx \boxed{107^\circ}$ (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Denote $x = EM$. The length of $DF$ is $2 \sqrt{2}\cdot 4 = 8\sqrt{2}$. Set $MD = y$, so $FD = 8\sqrt{2} - y$. Note $\triangle EMD \sim \triangle GDF$, so we have $$\frac{x}{4} = \frac{4}{8\sqrt{2} - y} = \frac{4}{4+4\sqrt{2} - y}.$$Rearranging the second equality gives $y = 4+4\sqrt{2}-\tfrac{16}{x}.$ Substitute this into $\tfrac{x}{4} = \tfrac{4}{8\sqrt{2} - y}$ to obtain $$x^2 = (8\sqrt{2} - y)^2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{16} = 32(8\sqrt{2} - y) = 32-64\sqrt{2} + \frac{512}{x}.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{512}$.

There are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\circ/12 = 30^\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 3:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 3 and the 4.  Therefore, the hour hand is $\frac12\cdot 30^\circ = 15^\circ$ from the 4 on the clock, and there are $2\cdot 30^\circ = 60^\circ$ between the 4 and the 6 on the clock.  So, the hour and the minute hand are $15^\circ + 60^\circ =\boxed{75^\circ}$ apart.

To find the angle between the hands of a clock at any time, we can use the formula:

angle = |30h - 11m/2|

where h is the number of hours on the clock (counting from 12) and m is the number of minutes past the hour.

At 3:30, we have h = 3 and m = 30, so:

angle = |30(3) - 11(30)/2| = |90 - 165/2| = |90 - 82.5| = 7.5

Therefore, the acute angle formed by the hands of the clock at 3:30 is 7.5 degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
The word ``COPYRIGHT'' has 10 letters, but two of them are O's, two of them are H's, and two of them are T's.  These repeated letters must be placed in the same order in each arrangement, and we must find the number of arrangements of the remaining six letters: C, P, Y, R, I, and G.  The number of ways to arrange these six letters is $6! = 720$.  But since the O's can be arranged in $2!=2$ ways, the H's can be arranged in $2!=2$ ways, and the T's can be arranged in $2!=2$ ways, there are $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$ arrangements that have the same six letters but are counted separately because of different arrangements of the repeated letters. Thus, there are $720/8 = \boxed{90}$ ways to arrange the letters of the word COPYRIGHT.

Let $x$ be the length of a side of one square. Since the domino consists of two congruent squares, its perimeter $P$ is equal to the perimeter of two squares, which is $8x$. Therefore, we have $$8x=60.$$Solving for $x$, we get $x=7.5$. 

The area of the domino is equal to the sum of the areas of the two congruent squares, which is $2x^2$. Substituting $x=7.5$, we get $$2(7.5)^2=\boxed{112.5}.$$

To find the median of a set of numbers, we first need to put them in order from least to greatest: 

6, 11, 12, 21, 30. 

The middle number is the median, so in this case the median is 12. 

To find the mean, we add up all the numbers and divide by how many there are: 

(6 + 11 + 12 + 21 + 30) / 5 = 80 / 5 = 16. 

Finally, we are asked to find the sum of the median and the mean:

The smallest 3-digit number of the desired form is $100$.  The next number of this form is $111$, which is $11$ more than $100$, and the next number after that is $122$, which is $11$ more than $111$.  Repeating this pattern, we see that if the hundreds digit is $1$, then the number must be of the form $100+11n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.  If the hundreds digit is $2$, then the number must be of the form $200+11n$.  In either case, the number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9$.  The numbers $100$, $111$, and $122$ have digit sums of $1$, $3$, and $5$, respectively, so we must check other numbers of this form.  We see that the smallest such digit sum of a three-digit number of this form is $9$, which is achieved by the number $\boxed{135}$.

Remember that $\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \cdot 3$, which equals $\boxed{75}.$

Since it has rained 5 times, I have multiplied by $\frac{2}{3}$ a total of 5 times. This is the same as multiplying by $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5$, by definition of the exponent. Similarly, I have multiplied by $\frac{3}{5}$ four times, or multiplied by $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4$.

Because I started with 4 on the whiteboard at the beginning of the month, the number on the board at the end of the month is $\displaystyle 4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4$.

We know that $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$, so we have  $$4\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^5\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4=4\left(\frac{2^5}{3^5}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{5^4}\right).$$We can make this calculation simpler by rewriting the expression and using the exponent law $\frac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}$, as shown below: \begin{align*} 4\left(\frac{2^5}{3^5}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{5^4}\right)&=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{3^4}{3^5}\right) \\ &=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(3^{-1}\right)=\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right). \end{align*}Now we evaluate the remaining expressions: $$\left(\frac{4\cdot2^5}{5^4}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{4\cdot32}{625}\cdot\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{128}{1875}}.$$

After the first rainstorm, the number on the whiteboard becomes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot4=\frac{8}{3}$. After the second rainstorm, it becomes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{8}{3}=\frac{16}{9}$. After the third rainstorm, it becomes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{16}{9}=\frac{32}{27}$. After the fourth rainstorm, it becomes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{32}{27}=\frac{64}{81}$. Finally, after the fifth rainstorm, it becomes $\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{64}{81}=\frac{128}{243}$.

After the first snowstorm, the number on the whiteboard becomes $\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{128}{243}=\frac{256}{729}$. After the second snowstorm, it becomes $\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{256}{729}=\frac{1536}{6561}$. After the third snowstorm, it becomes $\frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{1536}{6561}=\frac{4608}{19683}$.

Let's start by using a Venn diagram to visualize this problem. 

We know that 3 students received an A in both math and history. So we'll place 3 in the intersection of the two circles. 

```
          Math
          /   \
    A    /     \    Not A
        /   A   \
   History -----  
        \   Not A \
         \         \
           -----
```
Next, we know that 15 students received an A in math, but we've already accounted for the 3 who also received an A in history. So we'll place the remaining 12 in the circle for math that's not in the intersection.

```
           Math
           /   \
     A    /     \    Not A
         /   A   \
    12  /         \   20  
   History -----  
         \   Not A \
          \         \
            -----
```
Similarly, we know that 8 students received an A in history but 3 of those also received an A in math. So we'll place the remaining 5 in the circle for history that's not in the intersection.

```
           Math
           /   \
     A    /     \    Not A
         /   A   \
    12  /         \   20  
   History -----  
            \    A   \
             \    5   \
               -----
```
Now we can add up the number of students in each region to find out how many students received an A in at least one course.

A in math only: 12
A in history only: 5
A in both courses: 3

Total students receiving an A in at least one course: 12 + 5 + 3 = 20

Since there are 35 students in the class, that means there are 35 - 20 = 15 students who did not receive an A in either course. 

Therefore, 15 students did not receive an A in either course.

The perimeter of the hexagon is $6 \times 16 \text{ cm} = 96 \text{ cm}$.  The perimeter of the octagon is also 96 cm, which means the sum of the lengths of the eight sides equals 96.  If $s$ is the length of one side of the octagon, then $8s = 96$, so $s = 12$.  Therefore, each side of the octagon measures $\boxed{12 \text{ cm}}$.

First let's convert $6.\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=6.\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=66.\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $66.\overline{6}$ and $6.\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=60$, which implies $p=20/3$. As we know, $0.60 = 6/10=3/5$. We multiply the two fractions to get $$\frac{\cancelto{4}{20}}{\cancel{3}} \cdot \frac{\cancel{3}}{\cancel{5}} = 4.$$Voldemort had to pay $\boxed{\$4}$ for the ice cream.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we note that $6.\overline{6}$ can be expressed as $6\frac{2}{3}$ since $0.\overline{6} = \frac{2}{3}.$ Therefore, Voldemort bought $6\frac{2}{3}$ ounces of ice cream. 

Each ounce costs $\$0.60,$ so to find the total cost we can multiply the number of ounces by the cost per ounce: 

$$6\frac{2}{3} \cdot \$0.60 = \left(6+\frac{2}{3}\right)\cdot \$0.60 = 6\cdot \$0.60 + \frac{2}{3}\cdot \$0.60.$$ 

We can evaluate $6\cdot \$0.60$ as $\$3.60.$ To evaluate $\frac{2}{3}\cdot \$0.60,$ we can simplify as follows:  

$$\frac{2}{3}\cdot \$0.60 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{\$60}{100} = \frac{\$12}{100} = \$0.12.$$ 

Therefore, 

$$6.\overline{6} \text{ ounces of ice cream costs } \$3.60 + \$0.12 = \boxed{\$3.72}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
A positive integer is divisible by 3, 4 and 5 if and only if it is divisible by their least common multiple, which is $3\cdot4\cdot5=60$. To count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 500 that are divisible by 60, we first count the number of such integers less than or equal to 60 and then multiply this by the number of copies of 60 between 1 and 500. There are $\left\lfloor\frac{60}{60}\right\rfloor=1$ integers less than or equal to 60 that are divisible by 60. Between 1 and 500, there are $\left\lfloor\frac{500}{60}\right\rfloor=8$ copies of 60. Thus there are $1\cdot8=\boxed{8}$ integers between 1 and 500 that are divisible by 3, 4, and 5.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use combinations. A combination is a way of selecting objects from a set without regard to the order in which they are chosen. We can use the formula for combinations to solve this problem:

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

where $n$ is the number of objects in the set, and $k$ is the number of objects we want to choose. In this case, we have $n=20$ and $k=2$, so we can plug in these values:

$${20 \choose 2} = \frac{20!}{2!(20-2)!} = \frac{20\times19}{2\times1} = 190$$

Therefore, there are 190 ways to select 2 balls from a bin of 20, if the order in which they are drawn doesn't matter.

Using the given scale, 0.5 cm represents 1 km. Therefore, 1 cm represents 2 km (since 0.5 cm x 2 = 1 km). 

To find the actual distance between the cities, we need to convert the 4 centimeters on the map to actual distance using the scale: 

4 cm x 2 km/cm = 8 km. 

Therefore, the actual cities are 8 kilometers apart.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/954_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Since the robot's speed is constant, we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

We know the speed (which we'll call "s") and the time it takes the robot to travel 1 kilometer (which we'll call "t1"). Using these values, we can solve for the distance the robot travels in 1 kilometer:

1 kilometer = s x t1
distance = s x t1
distance = s x 2.5 hours

Now we can use this equation to find the robot's speed:

s = distance ÷ t1
s = 1 kilometer ÷ 2.5 hours
s = 0.4 kilometers per hour

We want to know how many meters long the hallway is, so we need to convert the robot's speed to meters per second (since we know the time it takes the robot to travel the length of the hallway in seconds). There are 3,600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute x 60 minutes per hour), so:

0.4 kilometers per hour = 0.4 ÷ 3.6 kilometers per second
0.4 kilometers per hour = 0.111111... kilometers per second
0.111111... kilometers per second x 1,000 meters per kilometer = 111.111... meters per second

Now we can use the formula distance = speed x time again, but this time we know the speed (s = 111.111... meters per second) and the time it takes the robot to travel the length of the hallway (90 seconds):

distance = s x time
distance = 111.111... meters per second x 90 seconds
distance = 10,000 meters

So the hallway is 10,000 meters (or 10 kilometers) long.

The area that is not watered is the area inside the square but outside the circle. The area of the square is $500\cdot500=250000$ square meters. To find the area of the circle, we note that the diameter of the circle is equal to a side of the square, so the radius is $500/2=250$ meters. Thus, the area of the circle is $\pi 250^2\approx196300$ square meters. Thus, the unwatered region has area $250000-196300\approx\boxed{54000}$ square meters.

Let $x$ be the number of seniors taking both history and science. We see $126$ seniors are taking history and $129$ seniors are taking science. If we add those numbers up, we still have to subtract the seniors that are taking both because we counted them twice.

So there is a total of $126+129-x=200$ students in the senior class. Solving for $x,$ we get there are $\boxed{55}$ seniors taking both history and science.

We can also solve this problem with the Venn Diagram below. Let there be $x$ students taking both history and science: [asy]
label("History", (2,67));
label("Science", (80,67));
draw(Circle((30,45), 22));

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we add the number of seniors taking history ($126$) and the number of seniors taking science ($129$). But this counts the students who are taking both history and science twice. We can correct for this by subtracting the total number of seniors ($200$). So:

Number taking both = Total taking history + Total taking science - Total number of seniors
Number taking both = $126 + 129 - 200$
Number taking both = $55$

Therefore, $55$ seniors are taking both history and science.

The sum of the angle measures in a pentagon is $180(5-2) = 540$ degrees, so $$\angle D + \angle E = (540^\circ - \angle A - \angle B - \angle C)/2.$$Since $\angle A$, $\angle B$, and $\angle C$ are all right angles, we have $(540^\circ - \angle A - \angle B - \angle C)/2 = (540^\circ - 270^\circ)/2 = 135^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle D = \angle E = \boxed{67.5^\circ}$.

Since $2+5=7$ and $2+5+A+B$ is divisible by 9, $A+B$ must be at least 2. Therefore, the least multiple of 9 greater than 2500 is 2502.  We may add multiples of 9 to 2502 to obtain all the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600, and 90 is the greatest multiple of 9 we may add without exceeding 2600.  In other words, the multiples of 9 between 2500 and 2600 are the integers of the form $2502+9k$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 10.  There are $\boxed{11}$ values of $k$ between 0 and 10 inclusive.

Extracting Answer from: 
A number is divisible by nine if the sum of its digits is divisible by nine. Since $2+5=7$ is not divisible by nine, we must make sure $A+B$ is equal to 9.

If $A=0$, then $B=9$. There is only $1$ such number ($2509$).
If $A=1$, then $B=8$. There is only $1$ such number ($2518$).
Continuing in this way, we find that if $A=2$, then $B=7$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2571$). If $A=3$, then $B=6$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2536$). If $A=4$, then $B=5$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2545$). If $A=5$, then $B=4$, which again gives us $1$ solution ($2544$). If $A=6$, then $B=3$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2533$). If $A=7$, then $B=2$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2522$). If $A=8$, then $B=1$, which gives us $1$ solution ($2511$). Finally, if $A=9$, then $B=0$. There is only $1$ such number ($2500$).

Therefore, the total number of different four-digit numbers that satisfy the given conditions is $1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=\boxed{9}$.

The smallest right triangle with integer lengths is the $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle.  Since none of those lengths are multiples of 8, we must scale each side up by a factor of 8 to create a right triangle whose side lengths are all integer multiples of 8.  This triangle has perimeter $3\cdot 8 + 4 \cdot 8 + 5 \cdot 8 = (3 + 4 + 5 )\cdot 8 = 12\cdot 8 = \boxed{96}$ units.

Extracting Answer from: 
Because the side lengths are integer multiples of 8, we can label them $8a$, $8b$, and $8c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Because triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle, we have the Pythagorean Theorem $64a^2 + 64b^2 = 64c^2$, or $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. We are told that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, so we are looking for Pythagorean triples where all three numbers are multiples of 8. Conveniently, we know that all primitive Pythagorean triples ($(a,b,c)$ where $\gcd(a,b,c) = 1$) are given by $a = m^2 - n^2$, $b = 2mn$, $c = m^2 + n^2$ for some positive integers $m > n$. If both $m$ and $n$ are odd, then $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all odd, which means that none of them are multiples of 8. The next possibility is that $m$ is odd and $n$ is even. The two smallest integer values of $m$ and $n$ that work are $m = 3$ and $n = 2$. Then, $a = 5$, $b = 12$, and $c = 13$, so the smallest possible perimeter in this case is $3\cdot 8 + 2\cdot 8 + 13\cdot 8 = \boxed{136}$. Note that $m$ and $n$ could also be larger even values, but we can check that the resulting Pythagorean triples will have larger perimeters.

We can start by rounding each number to the nearest tenth. In order to round to the nearest tenth, we must look at whether the hundredths digit is less than 5, or greater than or equal to 5.

A.	The hundredths place in 67.332 is 3, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3. 67.332 rounds to 67.3.
B.	The hundredths place in 67.473 is 7, which is greater than 5, so the tenths place rounds up to 6. 67.473 rounds to 67.5.
C.	The tenths place in 67.526 is 5, so 67.526 can round to only 67.5 or 67.6, not 67.4.
D.	The hundredths place in 67.445 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 4. 67.445 rounds to 67.4.
E.	The hundredths place in 67.346 is 4, which is less than 5, so the tenths place remains 3.

Out of all the answer choices, $\boxed{\text{D}}$ is the only one which rounds to 67.4 when rounded to the nearest tenth, so it must be the closest to 67.4.

Similarly, we let $Y$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $PQ$, so $\triangle AYC$ is a right triangle with legs $AP=PC=8$ and $CY=16-8=8$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $AC=\sqrt{64+64}=8\sqrt{2}$.

The difference between $7'5''$ and $5'5''$ is exactly two feet.  Since there are twelve inches in one foot, two feet equal $2\;\cancel{\text{feet}}\times 12\;\dfrac{\text{inches}}{\cancel{\text{foot}}} = \boxed{24}$ inches.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first need to convert the players' heights to a common unit. We can convert the height of each player to inches by multiplying the number of feet by 12 and then adding the number of inches. For Yao Ming, we have:

$7\text{ ft. }5\text{ in.}= 7 \cdot 12 \text{ in.} + 5 \text{ in.} =89\text{ in.}$

Similarly, for Earl Boykins, we have:

$5\text{ ft. }5\text{ in.}= 5 \cdot 12 \text{ in.} + 5 \text{ in.} =65\text{ in.}$

To find the difference in their heights, we can subtract Boykins' height from Ming's height: 

$89\text{ in.} - 65\text{ in.}=24\text{ in.}$

Therefore, Yao Ming was 24 inches taller than Earl Boykins.

Extracting Answer from: 
First let's convert $0.4\overline8$ to a fraction. Let $p=0.4\overline8$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=4.8\overline{8}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $4.8\overline{8}$ and $0.4\overline{8}$ of these two equations gives $9p=4.4$, which implies $p=44/90 = 22/45$.

Next, let's convert $0.\overline{37}$ to a fraction. Let $q=0.\overline{37}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 100 to obtain $100q = 37.\overline{37}.$ Subtracting the left-hand sides $100q$ and $q$ as well as the right-hand sides $37.\overline{37}$ and $0.\overline{37}$ of these two equations gives $99q = 37$, which implies $q = \frac{37}{99}.$

We add $p$ and $q$ to get our answer: \begin{align*}
\frac{22}{45} + \frac{37}{99} &= \frac{22}{45} \cdot \frac{11}{11} + \frac{37}{99} \cdot \frac{5}{5} \\
&= \frac{242}{495} + \frac{185}{495} = \boxed{\frac{427}{495}}.

Let $x=0.\overline{48}$. Multiply both sides by 10 to get $10x=4.\overline{8}$. Subtracting $x$ from $10x$ leaves $9x=4.\overline{8}-0.\overline{8}=4$. Solving for $x$ gives $x=\frac{4}{9}$.

Now let $y=0.\overline{37}$. Multiply both sides by 100 to get $100y=37.\overline{37}$. Subtracting $y$ from $100y$ leaves $99y=37$. Solving for $y$ gives $y=\frac{37}{99}$.

Adding $\frac{4}{9}$ and $\frac{37}{99}$ gives $\frac{44}{99}$. Thus, $0.4\overline{8}+0.\overline{37}=\boxed{\frac{44}{99}}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/990_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Mark bought $3$ more pencils than erasers, so let's call the number of erasers he bought $x$. Then, the number of pencils he bought is $x+3$. We know that he bought $7$ pencils in total, so we can set up an equation:

$$x+3=7$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x=4$. So Mark bought $4$ erasers and $7$ pencils. 

The amount of money Mark spent can be calculated by multiplying the cost of each item by the number of items he bought and adding the two amounts together. The cost of the pencils is $7p$ and the cost of the erasers is $4e$. Therefore, the total amount of money Mark spent is:

$$7p+4e$$

This expression represents the amount of money Mark spent in dollars.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/prealgebra/answers/991_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the three given numbers: 360, 450 and 540. We can start by factoring each number:

$360 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$

$450 = 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2$

$540 = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5$

To find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the three factorizations:

LCM $= 2^3 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2 = 2,700$

Therefore, the three planets will be aligned again after 2,700 days.

The $1$-digit primes are $2,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $7.$ Let's check each:

$\bullet$ $100-2=98$ is a composite.

$\bullet$ $100-3=97$ is a prime.

$\bullet$ $100-5=95,$ is a composite.

$\bullet$ $100-7=93$ is a composite.

(Check primes less than $\sqrt{100}=10$ as potential divisors.) Thus $100=3+97.$ Our answer is $3\times97=\boxed{291}.$

Since the $1$-digit prime numbers are $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$, they each lead to a different possibility for the $2$-digit prime:
\begin{align*}
100&=2+98,\\
100&=3+97,\\
100&=5+95,\\
100&=7+93.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the triangle inequality to solve this problem. The triangle inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

In this case, let's call the distance between Eric and Sam x. Then, according to the triangle inequality:

- Eric + Bobby > Sam (since Eric and Bobby together must be longer than the distance between them and Sam)
- Eric + Sam > Bobby (since Eric and Sam together must be longer than the distance between them and Bobby)
- Sam + Bobby > Eric (since Sam and Bobby together must be longer than the distance between them and Eric)

We can use these inequalities to set up a system of equations:

- Eric + Bobby = 8
- Eric + Sam > 10
- Sam + Bobby > x

We want to find the smallest possible value of x, so we should try to minimize it as much as possible. We can start by using the first equation to solve for Eric in terms of Bobby:

- Eric = 8 - Bobby

Then we can substitute this into the second equation:

- (8 - Bobby) + Sam > 10
- Sam > 2 + Bobby

Finally, we can substitute both equations into the third inequality:

- Sam + Bobby > x
- (2 + Bobby) + Bobby > x
- 2B + 2 > x

Therefore, the least possible value of x is 2B + 2, where B is the smallest possible value of Bobby. Since Bobby can be as small as 0 feet (if he and Eric are standing on top of each other), we have:

- x = 2(0) + 2 = 2

So the least number of feet that Eric could be from Sam is 2 feet.
