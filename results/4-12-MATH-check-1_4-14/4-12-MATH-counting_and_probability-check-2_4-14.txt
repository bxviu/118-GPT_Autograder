Extracting Answer from: 
For $n$ dice, there are $\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ ways to choose two of them. For each of these ways, there is a $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^{n-2}$ chance that all but the chosen two dice will roll a 1. Therefore, we need to find the value of $n$ for which $\frac{25n(n-1)}{2 \cdot 6^n}=\frac{25}{216}$, or $108n(n-1)=6^n$. Plugging in values for $n$, we can see that $n=\boxed{4}$ works and no value of $n$ less than 4 works. Now we just need to prove that no values of $n$ greater than 4 work. Note that if $n \geq 5$, then $n < 3^{n-3}$ and $n-1 < 2\cdot 2^{n-3}$. We can multiply these inequalities to get that when $n \geq 5$, we have $n(n-1) < 2\cdot 6^{n-3}$, or $108n(n-1)<6^n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Out of the $n$ dice, exactly two of them must not show a 1, and the remaining $n-2$ of them must show only 1's. The probability that a fair die does not show a 1 is $\frac{5}{6}$, so the probability that exactly two of the $n$ dice do not show a 1 is $\binom{n}{2}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2}$.
Therefore, we have
\[\binom{n}{2}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^{n-2}=\frac{25}{216}\]
\[\binom{n}{2}\cdot5^2=25\cdot6^{n-2}\]
\[\binom{n}{2}=6^{n-4}\]
\[\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=6^{n-4}\]
Since the right-hand side grows much faster than the left-hand side as $n$ increases, we can simply check integers starting from $n=4$ to find that $n=\boxed{6}$ is the solution.

We have 20 options for the president, and once we've chosen the president, we have 19 options left for the vice-president.  However, we must divide by 2 to correct for overcounting since the order in which we choose the president and vice-president doesn't matter. (If we choose president Jenny and vice-president Sam, that's the same as choosing Sam as president and Jenny as vice-president.)  Therefore, the answer is $\dfrac{20 \times 19}{2} = \boxed{190}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\begin{aligned}{{47}\over{288}}&=
4\left({1\over6}\right)^2+2\left({1\over6}+x\right)
\left({1\over6}-x\right)\cr&=
{4\over36}+2\left({1\over36}-x^2\right)\cr&=
{1\over6}-2x^2.\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\boxed{29}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Denote by $P(X = i)$ the probability of rolling the value $i$, and $P(F) = p > 1/6$. Then using the given information, we see that $P(F^c) = 1 - p < 1/6$ and $P(j) = 1/6$ if $j, j \neq F, F^c$. Furthermore we see that $P(7 - i | i) = P(7-i|\text{not }i) = p(7-i)$ by symmetry for $i \neq F, F^c$. All that remains is to identify $P(7-F|F)$ and $P(7-F|F^c)$. The first probability is just equal to $P(7-F|F^c)$ by symmetry, so denote it by $r < 1/6$. Then by the Law of Total Probability we get \[\frac{47}{288} = P(7 | \text{two dice}) = P(1)P(6)P(7-F|F)+P(2)P(5)P(7-F^c|F)+P(3)P(4)P(7-F|F)+P(4)P(3)P(7-F^c|F)+P(5)P(2)P(7-F|F)+P(6)P(1)P(7-F^c|F),\]which simplifies to \[\frac{47}{288} = (1-p)^2pr + p^2r(1-p) + 2p(1-p)r^2 + \frac{1}{36}(pr(1-p)+p(1-p)r+pr^2+pr(1-p)+p(1-p)r+r(1-p)^2).\]Solving for $r$ yields $r = 5/36$, so $p = 7/18$. The answer is thus $7+18 = \boxed{025}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\frac{2005}{3} = 668\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{4} = 501\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{12} = 167\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.

Every multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)

Extracting Answer from: 
If we list the multiples of 3 and 4 between 1 and 2005, the multiples of 12 will occur every 12th term. Thus, there are $\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{12}\right\rfloor = 167$ multiples of 12.
We need to remove these from the count, so we have $\left\lfloor\frac{2005}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{2005}{4}\right\rfloor-2\left\lfloor\frac{2005}{12}\right\rfloor$.
$\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{3}\right\rfloor = 668$ and $\left\lfloor\frac{2005}{4}\right\rfloor = 501$, so our answer is $668+501-2\cdot167=\boxed{836}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can solve this using complementary counting by finding the number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without eating a chocolate chip cookie first or last, and subtracting that value from the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies. Since all the chocolate cookies are identical and all the sugar cookies are identical, there are $$\dbinom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!}=35$$total ways for Amy to eat the cookies. If Amy doesn't eat a chocolate chip cookie first or last, there are $$\dbinom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$$ways for her to eat the cookies. So, there are $35-10=\boxed{25}$ ways in which Amy can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, let's count the total number of ways Amy can eat the cookies without any restrictions. She has 3 chocolate chip cookies and 4 sugar cookies, so there are $7!$ ways for her to arrange them.

Next, let's count the number of ways she can eat the cookies if she must eat a chocolate chip cookie first. In this case, she has only 2 choices for the first cookie (any of the 3 chocolate chip cookies will do), and then there are $6!$ ways to arrange the remaining cookies. So there are $2 \cdot 6!$ ways for her to eat the cookies if she must start with a chocolate chip cookie.

Similarly, there are also $2 \cdot 6!$ ways for her to eat the cookies if she must end with a chocolate chip cookie.

Finally, we need to subtract the number of ways she can eat the cookies such that she both starts and ends with a chocolate chip cookie, since we have counted these cases twice. In this case, she has only one choice for the first and last cookies (any of the 3 chocolate chip cookies will do), and then there are $5!$ ways to arrange the remaining cookies. So there are $1 \cdot 5!$ ways for her to eat the cookies if she starts and ends with a chocolate chip cookie.

Thus, the total number of ways she can eat the cookies such that either she eats a chocolate chip cookie first, she eats a chocolate chip cookie last, or both, is:

$$2 \cdot 6! + 2 \cdot 6! - 1 \cdot 5! = 1440$$

Therefore, there are 1440 different orders in which Amy can eat the cookies satisfying these conditions.

We can solve this problem using stars and bars. Imagine that we have three distinguishable bins for each type of cookie: one for chocolate chip, one for oatmeal, and one for peanut butter. We want to distribute six indistinguishable cookies among these three bins.

Using stars and bars, the number of ways to distribute six cookies among three bins is $\binom{6 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{8}{2} = \boxed{28}$.

We begin by finding all possible ways to arrange the 1, 2, 3, and 6.  There are only two orders which satisfy the conditions of the problem, namely $(1, 2, 3, 6)$ and $(1, 3, 2, 6)$.  We now insert the 4 into the lineup, keeping in mind that it must appear to the right of the 1 and 2.  There are three possible positions in the first case and two spots in the second case, bringing the total number of orderings to five.  Finally, when placing the 5 into any one of these orderings we need only ensure that it appears to the right of the 1, so there are five possibilities for each of our five orderings, making $\boxed{25}$ orderings in all.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first consider the number 1. Since it has no divisors, it can only be in the leftmost position. 

Next, let's consider the number 2. It can only be in the second position, since any number in the first position would not have 2 as a divisor. Once we place 2 in the second position, the only possible numbers that can appear before it are 1 and 4, since these are the only divisors of 2. 

Now let's consider the number 3. It can only appear in the third position, since any number in the first or second position would not have 3 as a divisor. Once we place 3 in the third position, the only possible numbers that can appear before it are 1, since it is the only divisor of 3. 

Next is 4. It must appear in either the fourth or fifth position (in either case, the numbers before it must be 1, 2, and 3). If 4 appears in the fourth position, then the only possible number for the fifth position is 6, since these are the only divisors of 4 not already in the sequence. The sixth position would then be 5. If 4 appears in the fifth position, then the only possible number for the fourth position is 6, and the sixth position would then be 5. 

Finally, we consider the remaining number, 6. There are only two possible positions for it: either in the fourth position with 5 in the sixth position, or in the fifth position with 5 in the fourth position. 

Therefore, there are only $\boxed{4}$ possible ways to write the numbers in the row.

We first place the non-math books. There are $4$ choices for the first book, $3$ choices for the second book, $2$ choices for the third book, and $1$ choice for the last book. Then we have to put the two math books between the four non-math books such that there is at least one non-math book between the two math books. We see there is a total of $5$ openings created by the four non-math books. So the first math book has $5$ choices, and the second math book has $4$ choices.

Since 3/4 of Mr. Shearer's class has brown hair, the number of students with brown hair is (3/4)(28) = 21. Similarly, the number of right-handed students is (6/7)(28) = 24. 

To find the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair, we need to find the greatest common factor of 21 and 24. 

The prime factorization of 21 is $3 \cdot 7$, and the prime factorization of 24 is $2^3 \cdot 3$. The only factor they have in common is 3, so the smallest possible number of students that could be both right-handed and have brown hair is $3 \cdot 1 = \boxed{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We consider the two cases:

Case 1: The three cards are all red or all black.

The probability that the three cards are all red is $\frac{26}{52} \cdot \frac{25}{51} \cdot \frac{24}{50} = \frac{6}{52 \cdot 17}$, since there are $26$ red cards out of $52$, and after one red card is chosen, there are $25$ red cards left out of $51$, and after another red card is chosen, there are $24$ red cards left out of $50$.  Similarly, the probability that the three cards are all black is $\frac{26}{52} \cdot \frac{25}{51} \cdot \frac{24}{50} = \frac{6}{52 \cdot 17}$.

Case 2: Two of the cards are red and one is black, or two of the cards are black and one is red.

The probability that two of the cards are red and one is black is $2 \cdot \frac{26}{52} \cdot \frac{25}{51} \cdot \frac{26}{50} = \frac{26^2}{52 \cdot 17^2}$, since there are $26$ ways to choose one of the black cards and two of the red cards, and after one of these cards is chosen, there are $25$ red cards left out of $51$, and after another red card is chosen, there are $26$ black cards left out of $50$.  Similarly, the probability that two of the cards are black and one is red is $\frac{26^2}{52 \cdot 17^2}$.

Thus, the probability that the three cards are not all the same color is $1 - \left( \frac{6}{52 \cdot 17} + \frac{6}{52 \cdot 17} + \frac{26^2}{52 \cdot 17^2} + \frac{26^2}{52 \cdot 17^2} \right) = \boxed{\frac{663}{850}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we will count how many ways the Democrats can sit together and how many ways the Republicans can sit together. Then, we will add these two numbers and divide by 2 to account for overcounting when both parties sit together.

If all the Democrats sit together, we can think of them as a single unit, which can be arranged around the table in $4!=24$ ways. However, the 5 Democrats can sit within the unit in $5!=120$ ways, so the total number of arrangements with all Democrats together is $24\times 120= 2880$. Similarly, there are $2880$ ways for all the Republicans to sit together.

Next, we need to count how many ways each group can sit together. Since there are 5 individuals in each group, there are 5 ways to pick the person who sits in a particular seat. This leaves 4 individuals who can be arranged in $4!$ ways around the table. Since the group can sit in either clockwise or counterclockwise order, there are $2\times 5\times 4! = 240$ ways for each group to sit together.

Finally, we add together the number of arrangements with all Democrats together, all Republicans together, and each group together: $2880+2880+2\times 240 = 6240$. However, we have counted each arrangement twice (once for clockwise and once for counterclockwise), so the answer is $\boxed{3120}$.

We need to count the number of ways to select a team with more girls than boys. There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: There are 4 girls and 2 boys on the team. We can choose 4 girls from the 8 available girls in $\binom{8}{4}$ ways, and 2 boys from the 6 available boys in $\binom{6}{2}$ ways. So, the total number of ways to select a team with 4 girls and 2 boys is $\binom{8}{4}\binom{6}{2}$.

Case 2: There are 5 girls and 1 boy on the team. We can choose 5 girls from the 8 available girls in $\binom{8}{5}$ ways, and 1 boy from the 6 available boys in $\binom{6}{1}$ ways. So, the total number of ways to select a team with 5 girls and 1 boy is $\binom{8}{5}\binom{6}{1}$.

Therefore, the total number of ways to select a team with more girls than boys is:

Extracting Answer from: 
We use generating functions. The generating function for the number of ways to write a sum of 1's is $x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\cdots = \dfrac{x}{1-x}$. Similarly, the generating functions for the number of ways to write a sum of 2's and 4's are $x^2+x^4+x^6+\cdots = \dfrac{x^2}{1-x^2}$ and $x^4+x^8+\cdots = \dfrac{x^4}{1-x^4}$, respectively.

Now, we want to find the coefficient of $x^9$ in the expansion of $\dfrac{x}{1-x}\cdot\dfrac{x^2}{1-x^2}\cdot\dfrac{x^4}{1-x^4}$. We can simplify this expression:

\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{1-x}\cdot\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}\cdot\frac{x^4}{1-x^4} &= \frac{x\cdot x^2\cdot x^4}{(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^4)} \\
&= \frac{x^7}{(1-x)(1+x)(1-x^2)(1+x^2)(1-x^4)} \\
&= \frac{x^7}{(1-x^2)(1-x^4)(1-x^6)} \\
&= \frac{x^7}{(1-x)(1+x)(1-x)(1+x)(1-x^2)(1+x)} \\
&= \frac{x^7}{(1-x)^2(1-x^2)^2(1+x)}.
\end{align*}

We can expand each of $(1-x)^2$, $(1-x^2)^2$, and $(1+x)$ as geometric series, and so the coefficient of $x^9$ in $\dfrac{x}{1-x}\cdot\dfrac{x^2}{1-x^2}\cdot\dfrac{x^4}{1-x^4}$ is the coefficient of $x^2$ in the product
\begin{align*}
& (1+x+x^2+x^3+\cdots)^2\cdot (1+x^2+x^4+\cdots)^2\cdot (1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots) \\
&= \bigg(\frac{1}{1-x}\bigg)^2\cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\bigg)^2\cdot \frac{1}{1+x} \\
&= \bigg(\frac{1}{1-x}\bigg)^2\cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{1+x}\bigg)\cdot \bigg(\frac{1}{1-x^2}\bigg)^2 \\
&= (1+2x+3x^2+\cdots)(1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots)(1+x^2+x^4+\cdots)(1+x^4+x^8+\cdots) \\
&= (1+x+x^2+2x^3+2x^4+2x^5+3x^6+\cdots).
\end{align*}The coefficient of $x^2$ is $\boxed{2}$.

If the resulting integer is divisible by 11 then the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits has the same remainder when divided by 11 as the sum of the second and fourth digits. This only occurs when the first, third, and fifth digits are 2, 3, and 7 (in some order) and the second and fourth digits are 4 and 8 (in some order).

There are $\binom{5}{2}$ total ways to partition these five digits into a group of 3 and a group of 2. From above, only one of these partitions will result in five-digit integers that are divisible by 11. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $5! = 120$ possible arrangements of these five digits. In order for the resulting integer to be divisible by 11, the sum of the first, third, and fifth digits must be equal to the sum of the second and fourth digits. We consider each possibility for this sum:

If the sum is $2+4+8 = 14$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is also 14. The only possibility is 7 and 7.

If the sum is $2+3+7 = 12$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 10. The possibilities are 4 and 6, or 6 and 4.

If the sum is $2+3+8 = 13$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 11. The possibilities are 4 and 7, or 7 and 4.

If the sum is $2+4+7 = 13$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 12. The possibilities are 3 and 8, or 8 and 3.

If the sum is $3+4+8 = 15$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is also 15. The only possibility is 2 and 7.

If the sum is $3+4+7 = 14$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 15. The only possibility is 2 and 8.

If the sum is $3+7+8 = 18$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is also 18. The only possibility is 2 and 4.

If the sum is $2+7+8 = 17$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 10. The possibilities are 3 and 4, or 4 and 3.

If the sum is $2+3+4 = 9$, then the sum of the remaining two digits is 20. This is impossible since the remaining digits are 7 and 8 which have a sum of 15.

Therefore, there are 8 possible ways to arrange the digits so that the resulting integer is divisible by 11. Therefore, the probability is $\frac{8}{120} = \boxed{\frac{1}{15}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $2310$ is $2310 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11.$ Therefore, we have the equation \[ abc = 2310 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11,\]where $a, b, c$ must be distinct positive integers and order does not matter. There are $3$ ways to assign each prime number on the right-hand side to one of the variables $a, b, c,$ which gives $3^5 = 243$ solutions for $(a, b, c).$ However, three of these solutions have two $1$s and one $2310,$ which contradicts the fact that $a, b, c$ must be distinct. Because each prime factor appears only once, all other solutions have $a, b, c$ distinct. Correcting for this, we get $243 - 3 = 240$ ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ where $a, b, c$ are all distinct.

Finally, since order does not matter, we must divide by $3!,$ the number of ways to order $a, b, c.$ This gives the final answer, \[\frac{240}{3!} = \frac{240}{6} = \boxed{40}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a couple of ways to attack this problem. One possible method is to factorize $2310$ and use casework.

Since $2310=2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11,$ we can consider different ways of distributing the prime factors of $2310$ among $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ The prime factorization can be expressed as $2310=2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11=2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot11\cdot7=2\cdot3\cdot7\cdot11\cdot5=2\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot3=3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot2.$ We have 5 choices of primes that $a$ can have, times the 4 choices for $b$ (since $b$ cannot have the same prime factors as $a$), which reduces to 20. Then $c$ must have the remaining 3 primes, so we have 20 sets.  However, we have counted each set six times (since order doesn't matter but we have ordered triples), so there are $\dfrac{20}{6}=\boxed{3}$ sets.

Another approach is to note that each factorization of $2310$ corresponds to a unique set of three factors that multiply to $2310.$ (What if there are repeated factors?) Therefore, the number of sets of three factors that multiply to $2310$ is the same as the number of ways to factorize $2310$ into the product of three positive integers greater than 1.

Let $p_1 < p_2 < \ldots < p_k$ be the prime factors of $n,$ where $k$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $n.$ Suppose $n$ has $k$ prime factors, and consider the factorization $n = a \cdot b \cdot c$, where $a \le b \le c.$ If $a$ is one of the $k$ prime factors, then $b$ can be any of the prime factors from $a$ to $p_k,$ inclusive, and $c$ is uniquely determined. There are $k$ choices for $a$ and $(k-1)$ choices for $b,$ so there are $k(k-1)$ ways to split the $k$ prime factors of $n$ into three factors that multiply to $n.$ However, we have counted each factorization six times (since order matters), so the answer is $$\frac{k(k-1)}{6},$$ which works out to be $3.$





Alternatively, the number of factors that $2310$ has is $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=32$. However, we must divide by $3!$ because order doesn't matter leading to $\dfrac{32}{3!}=3$ ways to choose $(a, b, c)$.

First choose a seat for Alice. It doesn't matter what seat we choose because we can rotate the table to move Alice's seat to wherever we want. After Alice's seat has been chosen, there are five seats Bob is willing to sit in. Of these seats, 2 are two seats away from Alice, and 3 are not. If Bob sits in either of the locations two seats away from Alice, there will be 3 places left Eve is willing to sit. If he sits in one of the other seats, there will be 2 places left Eve is willing to sit. Once Alice, Bob, and Eve's seats have been chosen, the remaining people can be placed in $5!$ ways. Therefore, the total number of ways for the 8 people to sit around the table is $2\cdot3\cdot5!+3\cdot2\cdot5!=\boxed{1440}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We solve the problem using complementary counting. The total number of seatings is $(7-1)! = 6!$.

We now count the number of seatings in which Alice, Bob, and Eve sit together. We treat the three of them as a single unit and consider the number of seatings of this "super-group" together with the other five people. We then multiply by $3!$ to account for the number of ways to seat Alice, Bob, and Eve within the super-group.

Treating the super-group as a single unit, we thus have six people to seat around a circular table, which can be done in $(6-1)! = 5!$ ways. We also have $3!$ ways to arrange Alice, Bob, and Eve within the super-group. Therefore, there are $5! \cdot 3!$ seatings in which Alice, Bob, and Eve sit together.

However, we have overcounted the seatings in which Alice sits next to Bob and Bob sits next to Eve (but Alice and Eve are not next to each other). There are two such seatings: Alice-Bob-Eve and Eve-Bob-Alice.

Therefore, the number of seatings in which Alice, Bob, and Eve do not sit next to each other is $6! - 5! \cdot 3! + 2 = \boxed{424}$.

We can seat the first person in any of the 7 seats. Then, we can seat the second person in any of the remaining 6 seats. Continuing in this way, we see that there are $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3$ ways to seat all 6 people in a line. However, each seating arrangement is counted 6 times (since there are 6 rotations of each arrangement), so we need to divide by 6 to get the number of distinct seatings around the circular table. Thus, the answer is  \[\dfrac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3}{6} = \boxed{210}.\]

The number of ways to draw one of these and two of the others is ${3\choose 1} \cdot {2\choose 1} = 6$, since there are 3 ways to choose which odd number to include and 2 ways to choose which of the remaining even numbers to include.

There are three cases to consider:

Case 1: The first and last books are different

In this case, the first and last books must be different types (i.e. math and physics or math and history or physics and history). There are three choices for the first book, two choices for the last book (since it must be a different type from the first), and then we have six slots left to fill with the remaining six books. We can do this in $3\cdot 2\cdot 6!$ ways.

Case 2: The first and last books are the same, and different from the middle books

In this case, the first and last books must be the same type (since they are adjacent), and different from the middle books (which must also be the same type). There are three choices for the type of book, and then two choices for the position of the two middle books. Once we have placed the middle books, we have four slots left to fill with the remaining four books of the same type. We can do this in $3\cdot 2\cdot 4!/2!$ ways (since the order of the middle books does not matter).

Case 3: The first and last books are the same, and the same type as the middle books

In this case, all eight books must be the same type. There are three choices for the type of book, and then we can arrange the eight books in $8!$ ways.

Putting everything together, the total number of arrangements is:

$$3\cdot 2\cdot 6! + 3\cdot 2\cdot 4!/2! + 3\cdot 8! = \boxed{98,\!208}$$

Three non-1's, which has probability $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right) ^3 = \frac{125}{216}$.

Exactly one 1, which has probability $3 \left( \frac{1}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) ^2 = \frac{75}{216}$ (the factor of 3 is for the three ways to choose which die shows the 1).

Thus, the probability that Michael does not roll at least two 1's is $\frac{125}{216} + \frac{75}{216} = \frac{5}{6}$, and the probability that he does is $1- \frac{5}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.

After some trial and error, we obtain the two lists $\{4,5,7,8,9\}$ and $\{3,6,7,8,9\}$.

Why are these the only two?

If the largest number of the five integers was 8, then the largest that the sum could be would be $8+7+6+5+4=30$, which is too small.  This tells us that we must include one 9 in the list.  (We cannot include any number larger than 9, since each number must be a single-digit number.)

Therefore, the sum of the remaining four numbers is $33-9=24$.

If the largest of the four remaining numbers is 7, then their largest possible sum would be $7+6+5+4=22$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 8 in the list.

Thus, the sum of the remaining three numbers is $24-8=16$.

If the largest of the three remaining numbers is 6, then their largest possible sum would be $6+5+4=15$, which is too small.  Therefore, we also need to include an 7 in the list.

Thus, the sum of the remaining two numbers is $16-7=9$.

This tells us that we need two different positive integers, each less than 7, that add to 9.  These must be 3 and 6 or 4 and 5.

This gives us the two lists above, and shows that they are the only two such lists.  The answer is $\boxed{2}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 7 letters in ELLIPSE. We can arrange all 7 of them in $7!$ ways. However, we must consider that there are two L's and two E's. To correct for overcounting, we divide by the number of ways to arrange the L's and E's. There are $2!$ ways to arrange the L's and $2!$ ways to arrange the E's, so we divide by $(2!)^2$. The number of ways to arrange the letters of ELLIPSE is therefore  \[
\frac{7!}{(2!)^2}=\boxed{1260}.

The probability of rolling 1 or 6 is $\frac{2}{6}$, and the probability of flipping heads is $\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game will end on the first turn is $\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$.  The probability that the game will not end on the first turn is $1-\frac{1}{6}=\frac{5}{6}$.  Given that the game is still going after 1 turn, the probability that the game will not end on the second turn is also $\frac{5}{6}$.  Therefore, the probability that the game does not end by the end of the second turn is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2$.  Similarly, the probability that the game is still going after 3 turns is $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3=\frac{125}{216}$.  So the probability that the game is over by the end of the third turn is $1-\dfrac{125}{216}=\boxed{\dfrac{91}{216}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $6\times 2 = 12$ possible outcomes on each turn.  The probability of {\em losing} one turn is $10/12 = 5/6$, so the probability of {\em not losing} on one turn is $1 - 5/6 = 1/6$.  The probability of not winning in three turns is thus $\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3$, so the probability of winning in three turns is $1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3$.  Thus, the required probability is $$\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{1} + \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{1}$$ $$\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\frac{5}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{1}\qquad+ \frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{1} = \boxed{\frac{671}{1296}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Since a multiple of 196 must have 2 factors of 2 and 2 factors of 7, we can count the pairs by focusing on the factors of 7. For one thing, 98 can be paired with any even number as it has 1 factor of 2, since $98=2 \cdot 7^2$ takes care of all the other primes. So, 98 can be paired with 2, 4, 12, 14, and 28, for 5 pairs. Then, 28 can be paired with (excluding 98 which we already counted) 21 and 14, both of which have the necessary factor of 7, giving us 2 more pairs. There are no remaining pairs of numbers 21 and smaller that are multiples of 196, because the only pair with two factors of 7, $\{14, 21 \}$, has a factor of 2 but not 4. So, there are $5+2=7$ pairs. And in total, there are ${7 \choose 2 } =21$ possible pairs, giving us a probability of $\frac{7}{21} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If we divide each member of the set by 2, we get the set $\{ 1, 2, 6, 7, 10, 14, 49 \}$. To get a product that is a multiple of 196, we need two members of this set whose product is a multiple of 49. Now, we can do some counting. If we choose two members of this set without restriction (i.e., we don't require their product to be a multiple of 49), there are $\binom{7}{2} = 21$ possible ways to choose two distinct members. However, we can't choose the pair $\{1,2\}$, since their product is not a multiple of 49. This leaves us with $\binom{7}{2} - 1 = 20$ pairs that we are allowed to choose. Of these pairs, the only ones whose product is a multiple of 49 are the pairs $\{7,7\}$ and $\{7,49\}$. Thus, the probability that we get a product that is a multiple of 196 is $\frac{2}{20} = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The probability for a single dart to land in the non-shaded region is the ratio of the area of the non-shaded region to the area of the entire dartboard. The area of the entire dartboard is $\pi \cdot 6^2 = 36\pi$. The area of the shaded region is the area of the second largest circle minus the area of the smallest circle, or $\pi \cdot 4^2 - \pi \cdot 2^2 = 12 \pi$, so the area of the non-shaded region is $36\pi - 12\pi = 24\pi$. Thus, our ratio is $\frac{24\pi}{36\pi}=\frac{2}{3}$. If each dart has a $\frac{2}{3}$ chance of landing in a non-shaded region and there are 9 darts, then the expected number of darts that land in a non-shaded region is $9 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \boxed{6}$.

The number $ad-bc$ is even if and only if $ad$ and $bc$ are both odd or are both even.  Each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd if both of its factors are odd, and even otherwise. Exactly half of the integers from 0 to 2007 are odd, so  each of $ad$ and $bc$ is odd with probability $(1/2)\cdot(1/2) = 1/4$ and are even with probability $3/4$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Notice that $ad$ and $bc$ have the same parity because $(a + b)(c + d) = ac+ad+bc+bd$ is always even. Therefore $ad-bc$ is even if and only if $ad$ and $bc$ are both even or both odd. There is a $\frac{1^2+0^2}{2^2}=\frac{1}{2}$ chance that $a$ is odd (the same is true for $b$, $c$, and $d$), and thus $\frac{1}{2}$ chance that both $a$ and $d$ are odd (the same is true for $b$ and $c$). Since the product of two odd numbers is odd, $ad$ is odd with probability $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$, and similarly, with probability $\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{3}{4}=\frac{9}{16}$, $bc$ is even. Therefore:

The probability that both $ad$ and $bc$ are even is $\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{16}=\frac{1}{64}$.
The probability that both $ad$ and $bc$ are odd is $\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{9}{16}=\frac{27}{64}$.

Therefore the probability that $ad-bc$ is even is $\frac{1}{64}+\frac{27}{64}=\boxed{\frac{7}{16}}$.

We also see that $31^2 = 961 < 1000 < 32^2 = 1024$. Thus, $31^2 = 961$ is the greatest perfect square between 10 and 1000.

It follows that there are $31 - 4 + 1 = \boxed{28}$ perfect squares between 10 and 1000.

The largest perfect square less than 10 is $3^2=9$, so the first perfect square greater than 10 is $4^2=16$. The largest perfect square less than 1000 is $31^2=961$, so we want to count the number of perfect squares between 16 and 961. The integers between 4 and 31 (inclusive) are the perfect squares  which fall within these limits, so we have $$31-4+1=\boxed{28}$$ perfect squares.

If we combine the house numbers on the north and south sides, we get exactly the odd positive integers. The $100^{\text{th}}$ odd integer is 199, so we divide the first 100 odd integers into three groups: \[\{1, 3,\ldots, 9\},\qquad\{11, 13, \ldots, 99\},\qquad\{101, 103, \ldots, 199\}\] There are five numbers with one digit, 45 numbers with two digits, and 50 numbers with three digits.

The numbers on the south and north sides are arithmetic sequences with common difference 4, so the $n$th house number on the south side is $4n-3$, and on the north side is $4n-1$. Since there are 50 numbers on each side, the total earnings are \begin{align*}
\sum_{n=1}^{50}(2(4n-3)+2(4n-1))&=8\sum_{n=1}^{50}n-6\cdot 50+8\sum_{n=1}^{50}n-50\\
&=8\cdot \frac{50\cdot 51}{2}-300+8\cdot \frac{50\cdot 51}{2}-50\\

Let $m$ be the number of main courses, and $d$ be the number of desserts. Then the number of appetizers is $2m$. So, the total number of possible dinners is $2m\times m\times d$. We want this to be at least 365, since there are 365 days in the year. Thus, we have $2m\times m\times d\geq 365$. 
 
To minimize $m$, we want to make $m$ as small as possible while still satisfying the inequality. We see that $m=6$ is the smallest integer that works, since $2\cdot 6\cdot 6\cdot d\geq 365\implies d\geq 4.0278$. Thus, the least number of main courses the restaurant should offer is $\boxed{6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first note that each circle can intersect any other circle a maximum of two times.

To begin, the first circle is drawn. The second circle is then drawn overlapping the first, and two points of intersection are created. Since each pair of circles overlap (but are not exactly on top of one another), then the third circle drawn can intersect the first circle twice and the second circle twice. We continue in this manner with each new circle drawn intersecting each of the previously drawn circles exactly twice. That is, the third circle drawn intersects each of the two previous circles twice, the fourth circle intersects each of the three previous circles twice, and so on.  Diagrams showing possible arrangements for $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ circles, each giving the maximum number of intersections, are shown below.

[asy]
draw((Circle((-6,.2),1)));
draw((Circle((-5,.2),1)));
draw((Circle((-5.5,1.2-sqrt(3)),1)));
draw((Circle((-2,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-2,0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-.5,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((-.5,0.3),1)));

draw((Circle((3.6,.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2,.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2.3,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((3.3,-0.3),1)));
draw((Circle((2.8,.8),1)));
[/asy]


The resulting numbers of intersections are summarized in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
Circles&New intersections&Total number of intersections\\ \hline
1&0&0\\ \hline
2&2&2\\ \hline
3&$2\times2=4$&$2+4$\\ \hline
4&$3\times2=6$&$2+4+6$\\ \hline
5&$4\times2=8$&$2+4+6+8$\\ \hline
6&$5\times2=10$&$2+4+6+8+10$\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Continuing in this vein, the greatest possible total number of intersection points using ten circles is\[2+4+6+8+10+12+14+16+18=\boxed{90}.\] Or, we notice that every unique pair of circles carries at most two unique intersections. There are $\binom{10}{2} = \frac{10\cdot 9}{2!} = 45$ different pairs of circles, which give a total of $2\cdot 45 = \boxed{90}$ possible intersections.

To be complete, we technically need to show that this number is possible, though we don't expect students to do this to answer the question. The diagram below demonstrates a possible positioning of the ten circles that achieves the maximum $90$ points of intersection. That is, every pair of circles intersects exactly twice and all points of intersection are distinct from one another. It is interesting to note that this diagram is constructed by positioning each of the ten circles' centres at one of the ten vertices of a suitably sized regular decagon, as shown.

If every circle intersects in every possible other circle (so that all circles intersect at two common points), then there will be $\binom{10}{2}$ pairwise intersections, which gives $45$ points of intersection. However, we have overcounted since three circles have formed triple intersections. There are $\binom{10}{3}$ ways to choose three circles, and there are two intersection points per unique triple of circles, hence there are 120 points which lie on three circles. However we have also overcounted the intersection of all 10 circles, which is counted $\binom{10}{2}-\binom{8}{2}+\binom{6}{2}-\binom{4}{2}+\binom{2}{2}=25$ times. Thus we subtract off 24 from 120 to obtain 96. 
Hence the answer is $45-96+2=\boxed{-49}$.

The even primes are 2 and 3, so a die roll that is an even prime is either 2 or 3. There are six possible outcomes, all equally likely, so the probability of rolling a 2 or a 3 is $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the probability of not rolling an even prime is $1-\frac{1}{3}=\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}$.

When we expand this out, we get a bunch of terms with $\sqrt7$ in them. To avoid painful estimation, we do the following trick: Add $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$ to this expression. We know that $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$ is small, since $2\sqrt7=\sqrt{28}$ is close to $5=\sqrt{25}$, at least compared to $6=\sqrt{36}$. When we add these together, the $\sqrt7$ terms magically cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, $$(5+2\sqrt7)^4=5^4+4\cdot5^3\cdot(2\sqrt7)+6\cdot5^2\cdot(2\sqrt7)^2+4\cdot5\cdot(2\sqrt7)^3+(2\sqrt7)^4$$ whereas $$(5-2\sqrt7)^4=5^4-4\cdot5^3\cdot(2\sqrt7)+6\cdot5^2\cdot(2\sqrt7)^2-4\cdot5\cdot(2\sqrt7)^3+(2\sqrt7)^4.$$ Therefore, their sum is $$2(5^4+6\cdot5^2(2\sqrt7)^2+(2\sqrt7)^4)=2(625+4200+784)=11218.$$ Since the term we added, $(5-2\sqrt7)^4$, is less than a half (actually, it's less than .01), $\boxed{11218}$ is the closest integer to $(5+2\sqrt7)^4$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $a=5+2\sqrt{7}$ and $b=5-2\sqrt{7}$. Then, $a+b=10$ and $ab=1$. Using the Binomial Theorem,

\begin{align*}
(a+b)^4&=a^4+4a^3b+6a^2b^2+4ab^3+b^4\\
&=a^4+b^4+4ab(a^2+b^2+2ab)\\
&=\left((5+2\sqrt7)^2+(5-2\sqrt7)^2\right)^2\\
&=\left(68+20\sqrt7\right)^2
\end{align*}

We can simplify this using the fact that $68=64+4=8^2+2^2$, so $68+20\sqrt7=8(2+\sqrt{7})^2$. Thus, $(a+b)^4=(8(2+\sqrt{7})^2)^2=64(2+\sqrt{7})^4$. 

Since $\sqrt7 > 2$, we know that $(2+\sqrt{7})^4 > (2+2)^4=16^2=256$, so $64(2+\sqrt{7})^4 > 16,\!000$. Since $b<1$, we know that $a^4 > (5^2)^2=625$, so $a^4+b^4 > 625$. Thus, $(5+2\sqrt7)^4=a^4+b^4+4ab(a^2+b^2) > 625+4(1)(16,\!000)=65,\!625$. 

We also know that $a^4+b^4=(a+b)^4-4ab(a^2+b^2)=(8(2+\sqrt7))^4-4(2+\sqrt{7})^2=(2+\sqrt{7})^4((2+\sqrt{7})^4-4)=81 \cdot 1331$. Since $(2+\sqrt{7})^4$ is between $2^4=16$ and $3^4=81$, we know that it is closer to $3^4=81$. Therefore, $(2+\sqrt{7})^4$ is closer to $81$ than to $16$, so $81 \cdot 1331$ is closer to $81^2=(5^2+4)^2=625+2\cdot5^2\cdot4+4^2=729$ than to $81\cdot16=1296$. Hence, the nearest integer to $(5+2\sqrt7)^4$ is $\boxed{729}$.

Note that at least one of the boxes must be a $1$-piece box, because the number of chocolates ordered was odd. The problem is now to determine how many ways $14$ pieces can be assembled using the $1$, $2$, and $4$-piece boxes. If we begin with all $1$-piece boxes, there's one way to do that. There are seven ways to have a mix of $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (one $2$-piece, two $2$-pieces, etc. all the way through seven $2$-pieces). Now, each pair of $2$-piece boxes can be replaced by a $4$-piece box. If there is one $4$-piece box, there are six ways to box the remaining ten pieces of chocolate with $1$ and $2$-piece boxes (no $2$-pieces, one $2$-piece, etc. all the way through five $2$-pieces). If there are two $4$-piece boxes, there are four ways to box the remaining six pieces of chocolate (zero through three $2$-piece boxes). Finally, if there are three $4$-piece boxes, there are two ways to box the remaining two pieces of chocolate (either no $2$-piece boxes or one $2$-piece box). Thus, there are a total of $1 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 2 = \boxed{20}$ combinations of boxes possible.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use a combination of casework and recursion to count the number of ways to package the chocolates. Let S(n) be the number of ways to package n pieces of chocolate. We can break this down into cases based on the size of the box used for the first few chocolates:

- If the first box is a 1-piece box, then we have S(n-1) ways to package the remaining n-1 chocolates.
- If the first box is a 2-piece box, then we have S(n-2) ways to package the remaining n-2 chocolates.
- If the first box is a 4-piece box, then we have S(n-4) ways to package the remaining n-4 chocolates.

Therefore, we have the recursive formula:

$$S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) + S(n-4)$$

with base cases:

$$S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1, S(2) = 2, S(3) = 2, S(4) = 4.$$

To find the solution for 15 chocolates, we can use the recursive formula repeatedly, building up from the base cases:

$$S(5) = S(4) + S(3) + S(1) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7$$

$$S(6) = S(5) + S(4) + S(2) = 7 + 4 + 2 = 13$$

$$S(7) = S(6) + S(5) + S(3) = 13 + 7 + 2 = 22$$

$$S(8) = S(7) + S(6) + S(4) = 22 + 13 + 4 = 39$$

$$S(9) = S(8) + S(7) + S(5) = 39 + 22 + 7 = 68$$

$$S(10) = S(9) + S(8) + S(6) = 68 + 39 + 13 = 120$$

$$S(11) = S(10) + S(9) + S(7) = 120 + 68 + 22 = 210$$

$$S(12) = S(11) + S(10) + S(8) = 210 + 120 + 39 = 369$$

$$S(13) = S(12) + S(11) + S(9) = 369 + 210 + 68 = 647$$

$$S(14) = S(13) + S(12) + S(10) = 647 + 369 + 120 = 1136$$

$$S(15) = S(14) + S(13) + S(11) = 1136 + 647 + 210 = 1993$$

Therefore, there are 1993 different combinations of boxes that can be used for the customer's 15 chocolate pieces.

The only way in which there won't be two dice displaying the same number is if exactly one number between 1 and 6 isn't being displayed on any of the dice and the 5 dice all display different numbers. There are 6 different possibilities for the number that isn't being displayed, and then there are a total of $5!$ ways in which the 5 dice displaying different numbers can be arranged, so there are a total of $6\cdot5!$ outcomes that result in the dice all displaying different numbers. Since each of the 5 dice can have 6 results when rolled and all of the rolls are determined independently, there are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\dfrac{6\cdot5!}{6^5}=\dfrac{5}{54}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\dfrac{5}{54}=\boxed{\dfrac{49}{54}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes when rolling 5 dice. To count the number of outcomes in which at least two dice show the same number, we can first count the number of outcomes in which all 5 dice show different numbers. There are 6 choices for the first die, then 5 choices for the second die (since it cannot show the same number as the first die), 4 choices for the third die, 3 choices for the fourth die, and 2 choices for the fifth die. This gives a total of $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 720$ outcomes in which all 5 dice show different numbers.

Therefore, the number of outcomes in which at least two dice show the same number is $6^5 - 720$. The probability of this happening is thus $(6^5 - 720)/6^5$, which simplifies to $\boxed{\frac{305}{324}}$.

The probability that at least one picture turns out is $1$ minus the probability that all the pictures do not turn out.  Since the probability that one picture will not turn out is $\frac{4}{5}$, the probability that $n$ pictures all do not turn out is $\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n$.  So we want

$$\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n<\frac{1}{4}\Rightarrow 4^{n+1}<5^n$$

If the probability of a picture turning out is $\frac{1}{5}$, then the probability of no pictures turning out when taking $n$ pictures is $\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n$. Therefore, the probability of at least one picture turning out is $1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n$. We want to find the minimum value of $n$ such that this probability is at least $\frac{3}{4}$, so we set up the inequality: \begin{align*}
1 - \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n &\geq \frac{3}{4}\\
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^n &\leq \frac{1}{4}\\
n\log\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) &\geq \log\frac{1}{4}\\
n &\geq \frac{\log\frac{1}{4}}{\log\frac{5}{4}} \approx 6.2

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the three one-digit integers be $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ in increasing order.  Since each sum in a row is the sum of two of the numbers in the row below it, the row of three numbers is replaced by two different ones in the next row.  Without loss of generality, let $a+b<c$.  Then $a+b$ is the smallest number in the second row, and we have $a+b+1<a+b+c<(c+1)+c=2c+1$.  So $2c+1$ is the largest number in the second row.  Since each of these numbers is the sum of two numbers less than 10, these numbers are less than 20, so $a+b+c \le 18$, and the largest possible number in the top cell is $18-2c+1$.  
Note that if $a=1$, we would need $b=2$, $a+b=3$, $c=4$ in order to get $1$ in the top cell.  Then $a+b+c=7$, and we have $7=1+(a+1)+(b+1)$ or $7=1+a+b+2$.  Since $a+b=3$, we must have $a=b=1$, and this contradicts the assumption that $a \le b$.  So $a>1$, and we must have $2(a+b) \le a+b+c \le 18$.  The smallest possible value of $a+b+c$ occurs when $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=6$, so the largest number in the top cell is $18-2 \cdot 6+1=\boxed{7}$.

There are a total of $6^3=216$ possible sets of dice rolls. If one of the re-rolled dice matches the pair we set aside and the other two form a pair, we will have a full house. But we will also have a full house if all three re-rolled dice come up the same.

Consider the first case. There are $3$ ways to pick which of the three dice will match a pair, and then $5$ ways to pick a value for the other two dice so that they form a pair (but don't match the first three dice), for a total of $3\cdot 5=15$ possible outcomes, plus the outcome that all five dice match.

In the second case, we need all three dice to match each other. There are $5$ ways to pick which value the three dice will have so that they don't match the first pair, plus the outcome that all five dice match.

So there are a total of $15+5=20$ ways to get a full house without all five dice matching, added to the possibility that all five dice match, which makes $21$ ways to get a full house. So, the probability is $$\frac{\text{successful outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}=\frac{21}{216}=\boxed{\frac{7}{72}}.$$

There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: The pair from the first roll shows up again in the second roll.

In this case, we essentially need to roll a triple and a pair with the three remaining dice. The probability of rolling a triple with three dice is $\frac{6}{6^3} = \frac{1}{36}$, and once we have that triple, the probability of rolling a pair with the other two dice is $\frac{\binom{3}{2}}{6^2} = \frac{3}{36}$ (we need to choose which value the pair will have, and then each die has a probability of $\frac{1}{6}$ of showing that value). So the probability of this whole case is $\frac{1}{36} \cdot \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{432}$.

Case 2: The pair from the first roll does not show up again in the second roll.

In this case, we essentially need to roll a triple with the three remaining dice and a different value with each of them. The probability of rolling a triple with three dice is $\frac{6}{6^3} = \frac{1}{36}$, and once we have that triple, the probability of each of the remaining two dice showing a different value than the triple is $\frac{5}{6}$. So the probability of this whole case is $\frac{1}{36} \cdot \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{1296}$.

Adding up the probabilities from the two cases, we get $\frac{1}{432} + \frac{25}{1296} = \boxed{\frac{7}{216}}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/1107_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let $P(n)$ denote the probability of getting a string of $n$ heads.  A sequence of three or four heads includes a sequence of three heads, so $P(3) + P(4)$ is the probability we want.  In general, for $n \ge 3$, let $P_H(n)$ denote the probability of getting $n$ heads in a row on a flip of a fair coin.  On the first flip, the probability that we get heads is $1/2$.  If we get heads, then we need to get $n - 1$ more for an $n$-letter streak, so the conditional probability is $P_H(n-1)$.  On the other hand, if we get tails on the first flip, then the probability of getting $n$ heads in a row starting on the next flip is just $P_H(n)$.  Therefore, adding both cases together, $$P_H(n) = \frac{1}{2} P_H(n-1) + \frac{1}{2} P_H(n).$$Simplifying, we get $$P_H(n) = \frac{1}{2} P_H(n-1),$$which means $P_H(n) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}.$

Now, let's compute  $P(3)$.  It's clear that the first flip can be anything ($P_H(1) = 1$), while the second flip must be heads with probability $1/2$.  If we assume that the first 2 flips are heads, then we can only continue our streak by getting heads on the third flip, which has probability $1/2$.  So $P(3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8$.

Next, let's compute $P_H(4)$.  As above, letting the first two flips be heads leaves only one option for the third flip, which is heads, and leaves a probability of $1/2$ for the fourth flip to also be heads.  So $P(4) = (1/2)^4 = 1/16$.

Finally, since this is a probability involving flipping a fair coin, we see that $P(1) = P(2) = 1/2$ and $P(0) = 1$. Thus, we can use the formula $P_H(n) = \frac{1}{2} P_H(n-1)$ to compute $P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3),$ and $P(4)$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
P_H(0) &= 1 \\
P_H(1) &= \frac{1}{2} P_H(0) = \frac{1}{2} \\
P_H(2) &= \frac{1}{2} P_H(1) = \frac{1}{4} \\
P_H(3) &= \frac{1}{2} P_H(2) = \frac{1}{8} \\
P_H(4) &= \frac{1}{2} P_H(3) = \frac{1}{16} \\
\end{align*}

We may assume that one of the triangles is attached to side $\overline{AB}$. The second triangle can be attached to $\overline{BC}$ or $\overline{CD}$ to obtain two non-congruent figures. If the second triangle is attached to $\overline{AE}$ or to $\overline{DE}$, the figure can be reflected about the vertical axis of symmetry of the pentagon to obtain one of the two already counted. Thus the total is $\boxed{2}$.

We count the figures that arise from Case 1.

Let us call the bottom vertex of $BC$ $G$, and the top vertex of $DX$ $H$. Since $\triangle BGX$ is equilateral, angle $BGX=60^\circ$. Moreover, $BG+GX=BC$, so both sides of $\triangle BGX$ are the same as the side length of the regular pentagon it is attached to, hence it must be congruent to other triangles of this form attached to different pentagons. Now, we split into cases based on the side length of the regular pentagon.

$ABCDIE$:

[asy]

B=(0,0);
C=(-3.1,9.5);

[/asy]

If $\triangle BHG \cong \triangle CHX$, then neither $BC$ nor $XY$ is parallel to $HI$ (as they are congruent equilateral triangles). Thus, we clearly can place the original pentagon within a hexagonal grid so that rotationally, $XY\to BC$ and $HI\to FG$. This would make $X\to B$, which is impossible, so we get no matches in this case.

$ACDEBI$:
[asy]
pair A,B,C,D,I,X,Y;
A=(10,0);
B=(0,0);
C=(-3.1,9.5);
D=(5,15.4);
I=(13.1,9.5);

Y=(19.8,2.1);
draw(A--B--C--D--I--cycle,linewidth(0.7));
draw(B--C--D--X--I,linewidth(0.7));

draw(B--X--Y--cycle,linewidth(0.7));
label("$A$",A,SE);
label("$B$",B,SW);
label("$C$",C,W);
label("$D$",D,N);
label("$I$",I,E);
label("$X$",X,SSE);
label("$Y$",Y,E);
[/asy]

If $\triangle BHG \cong \triangle CHX$, then neither $BC$ nor $XY$ is parallel to $HI$. Thus, we can place down a pentagon that will match this triangle without overlapping the previous one. Then, the right side of the attached triangles match, as do the left side, so they must be congruent. Thus, there is one way to make the figure from Case 1.

We now move on to Case 2.

[asy]
pair A,B,C,D,I,X,Y,Z,W,U;
A=(10,0);
B=(0,0);
C=(-3.1,9.5);
D=(5,15.4);

U=(-4.15,19.4);
draw(A--B--C--D--I--cycle,linewidth(0.7));
draw(A--X--C--cycle);
draw(A--Y--E--cycle);
draw(C--B--Z--cycle);
draw(I--E--W--cycle);
draw(D--C--U--cycle);
label("$A$",A,SE);

Denote the intersections of $XE$ with $CB$ and $ZY$ with $AB$ as $C'$ and $E'$, respectively. Since $\triangle XBC\cong \triangle EYC$, $C'B=XE$. Now, $\triangle C'XB\cong \triangle AIB$, as they share $\angle AIB=\angle C'XB=120^\circ$, and $\angle C'BX=\angle AIB-\angle ABB'=\angle C'AB$. Thus, $IB=C'X$. Similarly, $YE'\cong AIE$ using $\triangle EYE'\cong \triangle AIE$. 

Now, if we take one of these triangles and scale it down to the same size as the other, then since they are congruent, we know that $IB$ must be equal to $AE'=AI+IE'=AI+YE$. Thus, we can place down a pentagon such that $\overline{AI}$ is one of its sides, and attach the newly formed $\triangle C'XB$ and $\triangle AIE$ that we scaled down to the pentagon such that $\overline{AI}$ intersects $CB$ at $C'$ and $EI$ intersects $AD$ at $I'$:

[asy]

Moreover, swapping $XE$ with $ZB$ generates a unique (non-congruent) pentagon. The pair $(X,E)$ cannot be swapped with $(Z,E')$ because this duplicates Case 1 (up to a $60^\circ$ rotation). The pair $(X,E)$ also cannot be swapped with $(A,XD\cap AY)$, where $D\in CA$ and $XD\parallel AB$, since this would overlap with another possible pentagon coming from swapping $XB$ with $C'Y$. ($A$, $E$, and $XD\cap AY$ form an equilateral triangle.) Thus, we obtain six distinct configurations in this case.

In total, there is $\boxed{7}$ possible figure.

We know that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers. Also, the equation $x+2y=100$ can be rewritten as $x=100-2y$. So we need to find the number of positive integer solutions for $100-2y$. Since $y$ must be a positive integer, and $x$ must also be a positive integer, we have that $50\geq y\geq1$. Thus, there are $\boxed{50}$ ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy the given equation.

Probability questions are sometimes answered by calculating the ways the event will NOT happen, then subtracting.  In this problem the $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $6$ faces are paired to create $5 \times 5 = 25$ number pairs whose product is NOT multiples of 5.  This leaves $36 - 25 = 11$ ways to get a multiple of $5$, so the probability is $\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}$.

Picture the problem as having to make a total of $12$ moves (down or to the right), $5$ of which must be down. We can count the number of ways to pick $5$ moves out of $12$ to be down. This is equivalent to choosing $7$ moves out of $12$ to be to the right, since once we know which moves are to the right, the remaining moves must be down. Thus, the answer is $\binom{12}{5}=\boxed{792}$.

We see that it's easier to count the number of perfect squares, perfect cubes and perfect fifth powers less than $33^{2}=1089$. We see there are 32 perfect squares less than 1089, which are $1^2$, $2^2$, $\ldots$, $32^2$ and then there are 10 perfect cubes which are $1^3$, $\ldots$, $10^3$. There are 4 perfect fifth powers less than 1089 which are $1^5$, $\ldots$, $4^5$. Then notice there are 3 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes which are 1, $2^{6} = 64$ and $3^{6} = 729$. There are also 2 numbers that are both perfect squares and perfect fifth powers which are $1^{10} = 1$ and $2^{10} = 1024$. The only number which is both a perfect cube and a perfect fifth power is $1^{15}=1$. The only number which is a perfect square, perfect cube, and perfect fifth power all at the same time is $1^{30}=1$. So within the first 1089 positive integers we need to get rid of $32+10+4-3-2-1+1 =41$ integers which means the $1000^{\text{th}}$ term is $1000+41 = \boxed{1041}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to count the number of positive integers that are either squares, cubes or perfect fifth powers. Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be the sets of positive integers that are squares, cubes, and fifth powers respectively. Then, $$|A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |B \cap C| - |C \cap A| + |A \cap B \cap C|.$$ To count $|A|,$ we notice that the squares are $\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \dots\}.$ So there are $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor$ positive integers that are squares and $\leq n.$ Similarly, we can find that there are $\lfloor \sqrt[3]{n} \rfloor$ positive integers that are cubes and $\leq n,$ and $\lfloor \sqrt[5]{n} \rfloor$ positive integers that are fifth powers and $\leq n.$
For $|A \cap B|,$ we consider the numbers that are both squares and cubes. This means they must be of the form $k^6$ for some integer $k.$ We want the number of such $k^6$'s that are $\leq n.$ We can achieve this using the same technique as above to get that there are $\lfloor \sqrt[6]{n} \rfloor$ such $k^6$'s.
The best way to compute $|A \cap B \cap C|$ is to notice that $A \cap B \cap C = \{1, 64\}$ and compute this directly.
Using these counts, we have $$|A \cup B \cup C| = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + \lfloor \sqrt[3]{n} \rfloor + \lfloor \sqrt[5]{n} \rfloor - \lfloor \sqrt[6]{n} \rfloor - 2.$$ Therefore, the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are not squares, cubes or fifth powers is $$n - \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor - \lfloor \sqrt[3]{n} \rfloor - \lfloor \sqrt[5]{n} \rfloor + \lfloor \sqrt[6]{n} \rfloor + 2.$$ We want the $1000^{\text{th}}$ term of this sequence. We can guess and check values of $n$ until we find that $n = 3521$ gives a count of $998.$ Therefore, $3522$ is the $1000^{\text{th}}$ term, and the answer is $\boxed{3522}.$

Let's count as our outcomes the ways to select 3 people without regard to order.  There are $\binom{10}{3} = 120$ ways to select any 3 people.  The number of successful outcomes is the number of ways to select 3 consecutive people.  There are only 10 ways to do this -- think of first selecting the middle person, then we take his or her two neighbors.  Therefore, the probability is $\frac{10}{120} = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$.

There are $10$ people to choose from for the first pick, $9$ for the second, and $8$ for the third.  There are $\binom{10}{3}=120$ total ways to choose the three people.  To count the number of ways that the chosen people will be sitting in consecutive seats, we can first assume that the first person in the group of three is sitting at the top of the table.  There are then $7$ choices for the second person (the two people directly to the right of the first person aren't available), and only $1$ choice for the third person (the person next to the second person).  However, since the group of three could have started at any of the $10$ seats, we must multiply by $10$ to get the total number of ways that three consecutive people can be chosen.  Thus, the probability that three randomly chosen people are sitting in consecutive seats is $$\frac{10\cdot7\cdot1}{120}=\boxed{\frac{7}{24}}.$$

Let $E_1$ be the expected winnings if a $\heartsuit$ or $\diamondsuit$ is drawn.  Since the probability that any particular rank is drawn is the same for any rank, the expected value is simply the average all the winnings for each rank, so \[ E_1 = \frac{1}{13}(\$1+\$2+\cdots+\$10+(3\times\$20)) = \$\frac{115}{13}. \]Let $E_2$ be the expected winnings if a $\clubsuit$ is drawn and $E_3$ the expected winnings if a $\spadesuit$ is drawn.  Since drawing a $\clubsuit$ doubles the winnings and drawing a $\spadesuit$ triples the winnings, $E_2 = 2E_1$ and $E_3 = 3E_1$.  Since there is an equal chance drawing each of the suits, we can average their expected winnings to find the overall expected winnings.  Therefore the expected winnings are \[ E = \frac{1}{4}(E_1 + E_1 + E_2 + E_3) = \frac{1}{4}(7E_1) = {\$\frac{805}{52}}, \]or about $\boxed{\$15.48}$, which is the fair price to pay to play the game.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will compute the expected value of each card and find their average to determine the fair price to pay. 

The probability of drawing an Ace is $\dfrac{4}{52}=\dfrac{1}{13}$.  The expected value of drawing an Ace is $\dfrac{1}{13}(1)=\dfrac{1}{13}$. 

The probability of drawing a $2,3,\ldots,10$ is $\dfrac{36}{52}=\dfrac{9}{13}$.  The expected value of any of these cards is $\dfrac{9}{13}(1+2+3+\cdots+10)=45$.

The probability of drawing a face card is $\dfrac{12}{52}=\dfrac{3}{13}$.  The expected value of drawing a face card is $\dfrac{3}{13}(20)=\dfrac{60}{13}$. 

Thus, the expected value of drawing any card is $$\dfrac{1}{13}+\dfrac{45}{13}+\dfrac{60}{13}=\dfrac{106}{13}.$$Next, we take into account what happens if we draw a $\clubsuit$ or a $\spadesuit$. 

The probability of drawing a $\clubsuit$ is $\dfrac{13}{52}=\dfrac{1}{4}$, and if we do draw a $\clubsuit$, our winnings are doubled.  Hence, the expected value of drawing a $\clubsuit$ is $2\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\cdot \dfrac{106}{13}\right)=\dfrac{53}{13}$.

Similarly, the probability of drawing a $\spadesuit$ is $\dfrac{13}{52}=\dfrac{1}{4}$, and if we do draw a $\spadesuit$, our winnings are tripled.  Hence, the expected value of drawing a $\spadesuit$ is $3\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\cdot \dfrac{106}{13}\right)=\dfrac{159}{13}$.

Therefore, the overall expected value of playing the game is $$\dfrac{3}{4}\cdot \dfrac{106}{13}+\dfrac{1}{4}\cdot \dfrac{53}{13}+\dfrac{1}{4}\cdot \dfrac{159}{13}=\dfrac{365}{52}\approx \boxed{7.01}.$$Thus, to the nearest cent, we should pay $\boxed{\$7.01}$ to play the game if we want to play a fair game.

\left(10x^3-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 &= \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\\
&=\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^{5} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 + \binom{5}{1} (10x^3)^{4} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^1\\
&\qquad+ \binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^{3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 + \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{2} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\\
&\qquad+ \binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^{1} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^4 + \binom{5}{5} (10x^3)^{0} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\\
\end{align*} Notice that we only care about the constant term, which is obtained when $k=5$ because $\frac{1}{x^2}$ is negative and 10 is positive. Therefore, the constant term is $\binom{5}{5} (10x^3)^{0} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 = \boxed{\frac{5}{32}x^{10}}$.

The pentagonal prism has 10 vertices. To count the number of diagonals, we choose any two of these vertices and subtract the number of edges. Since there are $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ pairs of vertices, we need to subtract off the 15 edges of the prism which are not diagonals. Therefore, the number of diagonals is $45-15 = \boxed{30}.$

In this problem, we're really selecting two separate committees.

Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the $4,\!060$ ways to pick the men, there are $91,\!390$ ways to pick the women), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 7-member overall committee: $$ \binom{30}{3}\binom{40}{4} = (4,\!060)(91,\!390) = \boxed{371,\!043,\!400}. $$

There are 6 letters in the word ELEVEN. To determine the number of ways to arrange these letters, we can use the formula for permutations with repetition:

$$\frac{n!}{n_1!\cdot n_2! \cdot \cdots \cdot n_k!}$$

where $n$ is the total number of objects, and $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ are the numbers of objects that are indistinguishable from one another.

In this case, there are two indistinguishable E's, so we have:

$$\frac{6!}{2!} = \frac{(6\times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1)}{(2 \times 1)} = 360/2 = \boxed{180}$$

Therefore, there are 180 ways to arrange the letters of the word ELEVEN.

This leaves $25$ possibilities for the second letter, since there are no repeats, and then $24$ possibilities for the third letter, for a total of: $$5\times25\times24=3000\text{ letter arrangements}$$Next, we can count the number of ways to arrange the digits.  There are $4$ possible choices for the first digit, corresponding to the four elements of the set $\{1,2,4,6\}$.  This leaves $9$ remaining choices for the next digit, and $8$ choices for the last digit, a total of: $$4\times9\times8=288\text{ digit arrangements}$$Since the digits and letters can be arranged independently, the total number of license plates will be: $$3000\times288=\boxed{864000}$$

There are $4$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the second digit (since we cannot repeat the first digit). There are $2$ remaining digits, so there are $2$ choices for the third digit. Thus, there are $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24$ possible arrangements of the digits.

There are two cases to consider: either a red ball was replaced with a white ball or a white ball was replaced with a red ball.

If a red ball was replaced, there are now three red balls and three white balls in the jar. The probability of selecting a red ball in this case is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$.

If a white ball was replaced, there are now four red balls and two white balls in the jar. The probability of selecting a red ball in this case is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$.

The probability of a red ball being replaced is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$, and the probability of a white ball being replaced is $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.

Therefore, the overall probability of selecting a red ball is:

$$\left(\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{2}{9}=\boxed{\frac{5}{18}}$$

There are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways of choosing which two of the six dice come up 1s, and $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways of choosing which two of the remaining four dice come up 2s.  For the four remaining dice, each one has four possible outcomes (meaning it rolls a 3, 4, 5, or 6).  Therefore the probability is: $$\frac{15\cdot 6 \cdot 4^4}{6^6} = \boxed{\frac{125}{1944}}.$$

To get from $A$ to $B$, we need to take five steps to the right and two steps up, since $B$ is five steps to the right and two steps up from $A$. The total number of paths is then the number of ways to order a sequence of five R's and two U's. Every valid path must correspond to exactly one such sequence, and every such sequence corresponds to exactly one valid path. Therefore, the answer is the same as the number of ways to arrange five R's and two U's, which is $\binom{7}{2}=\boxed{21}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The third row of Pascal's Triangle is 1 2 1. The fourth row is 1 3 3 1. We can see that to get each element of a row, we add the two elements above it in the previous row. For example, the second element in the fourth row, 3, is obtained by adding the second and third elements in the third row, 2 and 1. 

Using this pattern, we can find the tenth row by starting with 1 and adding pairs of adjacent elements to get the next element. The sum of the elements in the tenth row will be the sum of all 10 elements in the row. 

Here are the first few rows of Pascal's Triangle to help us find the tenth row:

\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccccc}
&&&&&1&&&&&\\
&&&&1&&1&&&&\\
&&&&1&&2&&1&&\\
&&&&1&&3&&3&&1\\
\end{tabular}

To get the fifth row from the fourth row, we add pairs of adjacent elements: 1+3=4, 3+3=6, 3+1=4. So the fifth row is 1 4 6 4 1. 

We can continue this pattern to find the tenth row. Instead of doing all of the additions, we can also use the formula for the $k$th element of the $n$th row of Pascal's Triangle, which is $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Then we can just add up the elements of the row using this formula. 

The tenth row of Pascal's Triangle is:

\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccccc}
&&&&&&&&&&1&&\\
&&&&&&&&&&1&&1\\
&&&&&&&&&&1&&2\\
&&&&&&&&&1&&3&&3\\
&&&&&&&&1&&4&&6&&4\\
&&&&&&&1&&5&&10&&10&&5\\

&&&&1&&10&&45&&120&&210&&252&&210&&120&&45&&10\\
\end{tabular}

The sum of the elements in the tenth row is $1+10+45+120+210+252+210+120+45+10=\boxed{1064}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/148_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
For the number to be a multiple of 5, the last digit must be either 0 or 5. Thus, we consider two cases: 

Case 1: The last digit is 0. In this case, we have 5 choices for the last digit, and the remaining 5 digits can be arranged in $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$ ways. So the total number of eligible arrangements in this case is $5 \cdot 120 = 600$.

Case 2: The last digit is 5. In this case, the only choice for the last digit is 5, and the remaining digits can be arranged as before, in $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$ ways. So the total number of eligible arrangements in this case is $1 \cdot 120 = 120$.

Therefore, the total number of eligible arrangements is $600 + 120 = 720$. To find the probability that the number is greater than 500,000, we need to count how many of these eligible arrangements satisfy this condition. Notice that if the first digit is 6, then the number will be greater than 500,000. So we just need to count the number of arrangements that start with 6. There are $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 120$ ways to arrange the remaining digits, so there are a total of $1 \cdot 120 = 120$ eligible arrangements that satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the probability that the number is greater than 500,000 is $\dfrac{120}{720} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{6}}$.

We simplify the right side of the equation:
\begin{align*} 25+2(5)(3)+9 &= 25+30+9\\ &= 64 \end{align*}

Now, we want to combine everything on the left side to get a cube. We know that $81=27^{\cancel2}$, so that term will work out perfectly. We add and subtract $27x^2$ to set up the cube.
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^3-3x^2+81x-729 &= \left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^3-27x^2+81x-729+27x^2\\ &=\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^3-3^3\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^2+3(3)\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)(9)-27^2+27\cdot 3^2 \end{align*}

Notice that this is just $a^3-3a^2+3a-27+27\cdot 3^2$ when $a=\dfrac{x}{3}.$ Thus, we want to find all $a$ such that $a^3-3a^2+3a=27.$ We see that if we add $1$ to the left side, we get $(a-1)^3=27,$ so $a=\sqrt[3]{27}+1.$

Substituting back in for $x,$ we have $\dfrac{x}{3}=\sqrt[3]{27}+1,$ so $x=\boxed{3\sqrt[3]{27}+3}.$

More generally, suppose coin $A$ is tossed $n + 1$ times and coin $B$ is tossed $n$ times.

Consider the situation when coin $A$ has been tossed $n$ times and coin $B$ has been tossed $n$ times.  At this point, in terms of heads, either $A$ is ahead of $B,$ $B$ is ahead of $A,$ or they are tied.  Let $p$ be the probability that $A$ is ahead of $B.$  Then by symmetry, $p$ is the probability that $B$ is ahead of $A,$ so the probability of a tie is $1 - 2p.$

Now coin $A$ is tossed one more time.  If coin $A$ ends up with more heads, then either it was ahead before the last flip (which occurs with probability $p$), or it was tied before the last flip and got heads for the last flip (which occurs with probability $(1 - 2p) \cdot \frac{1}{2}$).  Therefore, the probability that coins $A$ ends up with more heads is
\[p + (1 - 2p) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use complementary counting and find the probability that the number of heads is equal or less for $A$ than for $B$. There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: Both coins toss the same number of heads. In this case, there are two sub-cases: either both coins toss $0$ heads, or both coins toss $1$ head. The probability of both coins tossing $0$ heads is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{32}$, and the probability of both coins tossing $1$ head is $\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\binom{2}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1=\frac{3}{16}$. Therefore, the total probability for this case is $\frac{1}{32}+\frac{3}{16}=\frac{11}{32}$.

Case 2: $B$ tosses more heads than $A$. There are four sub-cases to consider, based on how many heads each coin tosses: $(0,1)$, $(0,2)$, $(1,2)$, and $(0,3)$. The probabilities for each sub-case are: $\binom{3}{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\binom{2}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1=\frac{3}{8}$, $\binom{3}{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\binom{2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0=\frac{1}{8}$, $\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\binom{2}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^1=\frac{3}{16}$, and $\binom{3}{0}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\binom{2}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0=\frac{1}{8}$, respectively. Therefore, the total probability for this case is $\frac{3}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{3}{16}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{13}{32}$.

Thus, the probability that $A$ tosses more heads than $B$ is $1-\left(\frac{11}{32}+\frac{13}{32}\right)=\boxed{\frac{9}{16}}$.

Once the Independent's seat has been chosen, either all the Democrats sit to their left and all the Republicans sit to their right, or the other way around. Either way, there are $5!$ ways to put the Democrats in their seats, and $5!$ ways to put the Republicans in their seats.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since all members of a party must sit together, there are only 3 possible arrangements:

1.  The Democrats sit together, the Republicans sit together, and the Independent sits wherever.
2.  The Republicans sit together, the Democrats sit together, and the Independent sits wherever.
3.  The Independent sits between two members of one of the parties, and the remaining members of that party sit together.

For case 1, we can think of placing the group of 5 Democrats in a circle, then placing the group of 5 Republicans in a circle separately.  Since we are counting circular permutations, we divide by 5 to account for rotations.  The Independent can then be placed in any of the 11 gaps between the 10 people already seated, giving a total of $\frac{9!}{5\cdot 5}\cdot 11$ arrangements.

For case 2, we can follow the same approach, giving another $\frac{9!}{5\cdot 5}\cdot 11$ arrangements.

For case 3, we first choose which party the Independent will sit next to (which will determine the seating arrangement for that party).  There are two choices for this.  Then we can seat the group of 5 members from that party around the table in a fixed order (since they must all sit next to each other).  This gives us a total of $2\cdot 5! = 240$ arrangements.

Adding up the three cases, we get a total of $2\cdot\frac{9!}{5\cdot 5}\cdot 11 + 240 = \boxed{190080}$ arrangements.

To find the rank of $BAB$: first find the number of words that start with $A$, the number of words that start with $B$ and the number of words that start with $C$. We do that in a table:

$\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} & & & \\ [-2.5ex] \textbf{Position} & \textbf{Letter 1} & \textbf{Letter 2} & \textbf{Letter 3} \\ [0.5ex] \hline & & & \\ [-2ex] 1 & A & A & A \\ 2 & A & A & B \\ & & & \vdots \\ 26 & C & B & A \\ 27 & C & C & A \end{array}$

We can see that there are 9 words that begin with $A$, just as there are with $C$ (AAA, AAB, AAC, ABA, ABB, ABC, ACA, ACB, ACC), and 9 words that begin with $B$ (BAB, BAC, BBA, BBB, BBC, BCA, BCB, BCC, CAB). The arrangement of the second and third letters in each set of 9 words corresponds exactly to the ordering of the first 9 letters of the alphabet, so the number of words starting with $B$ that would come before $BAB$ alphabetically is exactly one-third of the words starting with $A$ and $C$ that would come before the letter $B$ alphabetically. Therefore, the first nine words in the list come before $BAB$. Now we delete the A's, B's, and C's in the first position of each of these nine words, and in alphabetical order we have:

\[AB, AC, BA, BB, BC, CA, CB, CC.\]
The only letters in alphabetical order which come before B are A and B, so of the nine entries above, only the $AB$ and $AC$ entries come before $BAB$ alphabetically, giving two possibilities. Therefore, $BAB$ is the $\boxed{11}$th entry on the alphabetical list.

Here an `outcome' is selecting two different 2-digit numbers, without regard to order.  There are 90 2-digit numbers, so this can be done in $\binom{90}{2} = 4005$ ways.

Now we need to count the successful outcomes.  Two numbers multiply together to give an even number if at least one of the original numbers is even.  To count this will require some casework.  However, casework makes us think about using complementary counting here.  We see that it's easier to count when the product of two numbers is odd: this happens when both original numbers are odd.

There are 45 odd 2-digit numbers, so two of them can be chosen in $\binom{45}{2}= 990$ ways.  These are the unsuccessful outcomes, so there are $4005-990 = 3015$ successful outcomes.  Therefore the probability is $\frac{3015}{4005} = \boxed{\frac{67}{89}}$.

There are 30 ways to draw the first white ball, 29 ways to draw the second, and 28 ways to draw the third.  However, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $3!$ to get $\dfrac{30 \times 29 \times 28}{3!} = 4060$ ways to draw three white balls.  There are 20 ways to draw the first red ball and 19 ways to draw the second, however, since order doesn't matter, we must divide by $2!$ to get $\dfrac{20 \times 19}{2!} = 190$ ways to draw two red balls.  So the total number of outcomes for both the red and the white balls is $4060 \times 190 = \boxed{771,\!400}$.

There are $\binom{30}{3}$ ways to choose the 3 white balls and $\binom{20}{2}$ ways to choose the 2 red balls. Therefore, there are $\binom{30}{3}\cdot\binom{20}{2}$ total possible combinations of white and red balls that can be drawn. Since the order in which the balls are drawn does not matter, we must divide by $3!$ for the white balls and $2!$ for the red balls, to eliminate the overcounting of different orders. Therefore, the final answer is:

$$\dfrac{\binom{30}{3}\cdot\binom{20}{2}}{3! \cdot 2!} = \dfrac{29\cdot 28\cdot 27\cdot 19\cdot 20}{2\cdot 3} = \boxed{10,\!939,\!200}$$

To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ such $n$.

Suppose that $*(n) = \{a, b, 2n-a-b\}$ for distinct integers $a$ and $b$. Then it follows that $a, b < 2n$. That means $2n-a-b < 2n$. If $a < n$, then $n+2$ and $\frac{n}{2}$ are the only elements in $*(n)$ that are less than $2n-a-b$, contradiction. The same applies for $b < n$. Hence, $a,b \ge n$. Furthermore, $2n-a-b = n-2$ would imply $a+b = 3n$, but if $a,b \ge n$ then $a+b \ge 2n > 3n$, contradiction. Similarly, we can't have $2n-a-b = n+2$, $2n$, or $\frac{n}{2}$. So the only possibility is that $*(n)$ consists of $n+2$, $2n$, and $2n-(n+2)-(2n) = n-2$. Thus, we must have $n+2 \ge 2n-2$, which implies $n \le 4$.

Since the shaded triangle has base length 2 and height 1, its area is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 1$.  Therefore, the probability that $1<x+y<3$ is equal to $\frac{1}{9}$, and the probability that $x+y \geq 3$ (which corresponds to a non-existent triangle) is equal to $1-\frac{1}{9} = \boxed{\frac{8}{9}}$.

The total area of the target is $\pi\cdot 10^2=100\pi$.  The area of the inner shaded region is the area of a circle with radius 4, and that is equal to $\pi\cdot 4^2=16\pi$.  We can calculate the area of the shaded ring as the difference in areas of a circle with radius 8 and with radius 6.  This gives an area of $\pi \cdot 8^2 - \pi \cdot 6^2 = 28\pi$.

There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The probability that we flip at least 6 heads is equal to the probability that we flip at least 6 tails, by symmetry.  Let's call this probability $p$.  The only other possibility is that we flip exactly 5 heads and 5 tails, for which the probability is $\dfrac{\binom{10}{5}}{2^{10}} = \dfrac{252}{1024} = \dfrac{63}{256}$.  Therefore, $\dfrac{63}{256} + 2p = 1$, giving $$ p=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{63}{256}\right)=\boxed{\frac{193}{512}} $$

We can solve this problem using the binomial distribution. Let $X$ be the number of heads in 10 flips of a fair coin. Then $X$ has a binomial distribution with parameters $n = 10$ and $p = 0.5$, since each flip is independent and has a probability of 0.5 of being heads.

We want to find the probability $P(X \geq 6)$. We can use the complement rule and find the probability of getting less than 6 heads, and subtract that from 1:

\begin{align*}
P(X \geq 6) &= 1 - P(X < 6) \\
&= 1 - P(X \leq 5) \\
&= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{10}{k} 0.5^k (1-0.5)^{10-k} \\
&= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{10}{k} 0.5^k 0.5^{10-k} \\
&= 1 - \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{10}{k} 0.5^{10} \\
&= 1 - 0.377 \\
&= \boxed{0.623}
\end{align*}

We can use a calculator or software to evaluate the sum, or we can use the complement rule again to write:

\begin{align*}
P(X \geq 6) &= 1 - P(X \leq 5) \\
&= 1 - \texttt{binomcdf}(10, 0.5, 5) \\
&= 1 - 0.377 \\
&= \boxed{0.623}
\end{align*}

Rotate each bracelet so the teal bead is at the top. If we flip a bracelet over, leaving the teal bead in place, the three beads on the left flip to the right, and vice-versa. We can flip all of the bracelets so there are more orange beads on the left than on the right, since there are an odd number of orange beads total. If there are 2 orange beads on the left, there are three choices for the position of the black bead on the left and 3 for the position of the orange bead on the right, making 9 bracelets. If all three beads on the left are orange, we get one more bracelet, for a total of $9+1=\boxed{10}$ bracelets.

We can start by counting the total number of arrangements of the beads as if each bead was distinct, then divide by the number of arrangements that are equivalent due to rotations and flips.

First, consider the number of ways to arrange 7 distinct beads. This is $7!$. However, we need to divide by $3!$ twice because the orange beads are identical to each other, the black beads are identical to each other, and there are two sets of identical beads. Therefore, there are $\frac{7!}{3!3!1!}$ ways to arrange the beads in a line.

To count the number of bracelets, note that we can start with any bead and arrange the other 6 beads in a circle in $\frac{6!}{3!3!}$ ways. However, we must divide by 7 because there are 7 identical rotations of each bracelet. Also, we need to divide by 2 because flipping a bracelet over gives the same result. Therefore, the total number of distinct bracelets is:

$$
\frac{1}{7}\cdot\frac{6!}{3!3!}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{30}.

The shaded region represents the times that Annie and Xenas would see each other at the party.  For example, if Annie arrived at 2:00, Xenas could arrive at any time between 2:00 and 2:45 and see Annie at the party.  Let one hour equal one unit.  Then, we can calculate the area of the shaded region as the area of the entire square minus the areas of the two unshaded triangles.  This equals $$2\cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{4}=\frac{25}{16}.$$ So the area of the shaded region is $$4-\frac{25}{16}=\frac{64-25}{16}= \frac{39}{16}.$$ Since the area of the square is 4, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $$\dfrac{39/16}{4} = \boxed{\dfrac{39}{64}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's consider the possible times when Annie arrives at the party. She could arrive anytime between 2:00 and 3:15 in order to guarantee that she will still be at the party when Xenas arrives. Similarly, Xenas could arrive anytime between 2:15 and 4:00.

Therefore, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is equal to the area of the square with bottom left corner (2:00, 2:15) and upper right corner (3:15, 4:00), divided by the area of the square with bottom left corner (2:00, 2:00) and upper right corner (4:00, 4:00).

The area of the first square is $(3:15-2:00)(4:00-2:15) = 1.25 \cdot 1.75 = 2.1875.$

The area of the second square is $(4:00-2:00)(4:00-2:00) = 4 \cdot 4 = 16.$

Therefore, the probability that Annie and Xenas see each other at the party is $\dfrac{2.1875}{16}=\boxed{0.1367}$.

There are ${5\choose 2}=10$ different pairs of numbers Tina can choose from $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Each pair has a different sum from $3$ to $9$, so Sergio needs to choose a number between $4$ and $10$ inclusive to have a number larger than the sum. In total, there are $10\cdot7=70$ possibilities for pairs of numbers chosen by Tina and a number chosen by Sergio. There are $4\cdot 3=12$ possibilities for the pair of numbers chosen and for Sergio to get a number larger than the sum: Tina can choose $1$ and $2$ in either order, and then Sergio can choose $4,$ $5,$ $6,$ $7,$ $8,$ $9,$ or $10$. Therefore, the probability that Sergio chooses a number larger than the sum of Tina's two numbers is $\frac{12}{70}=\boxed{\frac{6}{35}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two steps to this problem: first, we need to calculate the probability of selecting two freshman girls and three freshman boys from the class, and second, we need to account for all possible groups of five students that could be selected.

Step 1: The probability of selecting two freshman girls and three freshman boys can be calculated as follows:

- The probability of selecting two freshman girls is $\frac{12}{15} \cdot \frac{11}{14} = \frac{22}{35}$, since there are 12 freshman girls out of 15 total girls in the class, and we are selecting without replacement.
- The probability of selecting three freshman boys is $\frac{11}{15} \cdot \frac{10}{14} \cdot \frac{9}{13} = \frac{99}{273}$, since there are 11 freshman boys out of 15 total boys in the class, and we are selecting without replacement.
- Multiplying these probabilities together, we get $\frac{22}{35} \cdot \frac{99}{273} = \frac{242}{1365} \approx 0.177$.

Step 2: To account for all possible groups of five students that could be selected, we need to calculate the total number of such groups. This is simply the number of ways to choose 5 students out of 30, which is given by the binomial coefficient ${30 \choose 5} = 142,506$.

Therefore, the probability of selecting two freshman girls and three freshman boys from a randomly selected group of five students is:

$$\frac{\text{number of desired groups}}{\text{total number of groups}} = \frac{242/1365}{142506} \approx \boxed{0.000017}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we consider the arrangements in which all three groups are seated together.  We treat each group as a single entity and have six entities to arrange about a circular table.  There are $6!$ ways to seat the six entities, but we must divide by 3! to account for the permutations of the England representatives, by 4! for the permutations of the German representatives, and by 2! for the permutations of the French representatives, giving 
\[\frac{6!}{3!\cdot 4! \cdot 2!} = 15\] arrangements.

Now we consider the arrangements in which only two groups are seated together. If the English representatives sit together, there are $2!$ ways to order the German and French representatives so that each sits together.  We must then seat the three English representatives, and there are $3!$ ways to do so.  We then have five entities to arrange about a circular table, which can be done in $4!$ ways.  This gives a total of $2! \cdot 3! \cdot 4! = 144$ arrangements in which the English representatives sit together.  Similarly, there are $3! \cdot 4! \cdot 2! = 144$ arrangements in which the German representatives sit together, and $2! \cdot 4! \cdot 3! = 144$ arrangements in which the French representatives sit together.  Thus, there are $3\cdot 144 = 432$ arrangements in which only two groups are seated together.

Finally, we consider the arrangements in which no two representatives of the same country sit together.  Since there are three groups, one of the groups must be split.  There are three ways to choose which group is split.  Suppose, without loss of generality, that we split the German representatives.  We must seat one representative to the left of each of the English representatives, and one representative to the left of each of the French representatives.  This forces the order 
\[EFGERGERGER\]
We can then assign the English representatives seats in $3!$ ways, and the French representatives seats in $2!$ ways, giving a total of $3! \cdot 2! = 12$ arrangements.

Thus, the total number of arrangements is $15 + 432 + 12 = \boxed{459}$.

Case 2: 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat
There are $\binom{8}{4}$ ways to choose 4 Republicans and $\binom{6}{1}$ ways to choose 1 Democrat.  The total number of subcommittees with this breakdown is $\binom{8}{4}\binom{6}{1}$.

Case 3: 5 Republicans and 0 Democrats
There are $\binom{8}{5}$ ways to choose 5 Republicans.  The total number of subcommittees with this breakdown is $\binom{8}{5}$.

The total number of subcommittees with at least one member from each party is then the sum of the subcommittees from each case: $$\binom{8}{3}\binom{6}{2}+\binom{8}{4}\binom{6}{1}+\binom{8}{5}=3924.$$Therefore, there are $\boxed{3924}$ ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members with at least one member from each party.

The number of combinations of fruit possible is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$. However, if strawberries and pineapples cannot go together, that decreases the number of combinations by three (because they could be paired with apples, grapes, or bananas). Similarly, if grapes and bananas cannot go together, the number of combinations is reduced by another three. Thus, $10 - 3 - 3 = \boxed{4}$ such salads are possible.

We can start by using complementary counting. There are a total of $\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose $3$ fruits from the $5$ options. We want to count the number of bad salads, i.e. the salads that contain either strawberries and pineapples or grapes and bananas.

If a salad contains strawberries and pineapples, then the third fruit can be any of the $3$ remaining options (apples, bananas, or grapes). Similarly, if a salad contains grapes and bananas, then the third fruit can be any of the $3$ remaining options (apples, strawberries, or pineapples). So, there are $3$ bad salads for each of those $2$ cases, giving us a total of $6$ bad salads.

Hence, there are $10-6=\boxed{4}$ good salads.

Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\frac{5}{9}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.

There are $6^3=216$ possible outcomes when you roll three dice. There are $6$ ways that you can roll any specific number (i.e. $1-1-1$, $2-2-2$, etc.), so there are $6$ ways to roll three of the same number. We can choose which number we roll three of in $6$ ways, so there are $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ ways to roll three of any specific number.

There are also ${3\choose2}=3$ ways to pick two of the dice that will match, and for each of those choices there are $6$ possible values that those dice could all show. So there are $3 \cdot 6 = 18$ ways to have two dice that match.

Therefore, there are $36+18=54$ outcomes where at least two dice match. The probability that at least two dice match is $\dfrac{54}{216} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $\binom{9}{3}=84$ ways to choose three points from the grid. To find the number of sets of points that are collinear, we consider the following cases:

Case 1: Choose three points in a row.

There are three rows to choose from and $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose each row, so this case gives us $3\binom{3}{1}=9$ sets.

Case 2: Choose three points in a column.

This case is similar to Case 1 and also gives us $9$ sets.

Case 3: Choose three points on the diagonal.

There are two diagonals to choose from and $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose each diagonal, so this case gives us $2\binom{3}{1}=6$ sets.

Therefore, there are $9+9+6=24$ sets of three points that are collinear. Thus, the probability of choosing a set that is collinear is $\dfrac{24}{84}=\boxed{\dfrac{2}{7}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can tackle the problem by counting the number of ways to arrange the books if there were no restrictions and then subtracting the arrangements that violate the given condition.

Without restrictions, there are $4! = 24$ ways to arrange the books. Now we need to count the arrangements that violate the given condition, i.e. the arrangements where a book other than the smallest one is at the end of the bookshelf.

There are three books that could potentially be at the end of the bookshelf: the second smallest book, the third smallest book, and the largest book. For each of these cases, we can count the number of ways to arrange the remaining books and then multiply by the number of ways to arrange the books involving the book at the end.

Case 1: The second smallest book is at the end
If the second smallest book is at the end, we have three books (the smallest, the second largest, and the largest) to arrange in the remaining three spots. This can be done in $3!$ ways. For any of these arrangements, the second smallest book can be placed either first or second, giving a total of $2\cdot 3! = 12$ arrangements.

Case 2: The third smallest book is at the end
If the third smallest book is at the end, we have three books (the smallest, the second smallest, and the largest) to arrange in the remaining three spots. This can be done in $3!$ ways. For any of these arrangements, the third smallest book can be placed either first or second, giving a total of $2\cdot 3! = 12$ arrangements.

Case 3: The largest book is at the end
If the largest book is at the end, we have three books (the smallest, the second smallest, and the second largest) to arrange in the remaining three spots. This can be done in $3!$ ways. For any of these arrangements, the largest book can be placed either first, second, or third, giving a total of $3\cdot 3! = 18$ arrangements.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements that violate the given condition is $12+12+18 = 42$. Subtracting this from the total number of arrangements gives us $24-42 = \boxed{ -18 }$, but this is obviously not a valid answer. The reason for this is that we have counted some of the arrangements twice in the three cases above. Specifically, the arrangements where the second smallest book is at the end and the largest book is at the end are the same as the arrangements where the third smallest book is at the end and the largest book is at the end, respectively.

The correct way to handle this is to use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE). Let $A$ be the set of arrangements where the second smallest book is at the end, let $B$ be the set of arrangements where the third smallest book is at the end, and let $C$ be the set of arrangements where the largest book is at the end. Then the number of arrangements that violate the given condition is $|A\cup B\cup C|$. We have already counted $|A|+|B|+|C|$ and need to subtract the arrangements that have been counted twice. Since there are only two such arrangements (where both the second smallest and the third smallest books are at the end), the number of arrangements that violate the condition is $|A\cup B\cup C| = |A|+|B|+|C| - 2 = 42 - 2 = 40$.

Therefore, the number of valid arrangements is $24-40 = \boxed{-16}$.

If we let 1 unit be one minute, the area of the shaded region is $\frac{45^2}{2}$ square units and the whole area is 3600 square units. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point will land in the shaded region is $\frac{45^2}{2\cdot 3600}=\boxed{\frac{9}{32}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We choose Alice's arrival as the start of the time period, so that she is $\frac{1}{2}$ hour late if she arrives at any
time from 5:30 to 6:00. There is an equal probability that Bob arrives at any time between 5:00 and 6:00.
Without loss of generality (we could exchange Alice and Bob's arrival times without changing the
problem), we calculate the probability that Bob arrives within 45 minutes after Alice. This
is equivalent to saying that Alice arrives in the first 15 minutes after the start of the hour,
or 35 minutes before the end. We then consider the different possibilities based on when
Alice arrives in this period.

$\bullet$ Alice arrives between 5:45 and 5:50. Bob has to arrive between 5:50 and 6:00. Since both
arrivals are random and uniformly distributed over this interval of length 10 minutes,
the probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{10}=\frac{1}{60}$.

$\bullet$ Alice arrives between 5:40 and 5:45. Bob has to arrive between 5:45 and 6:00, so he has
15 minutes to arrive. The probability of this is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{15}=\frac{1}{90}$.

$\bullet$ Alice arrives between 5:35 and 5:40. Bob has to arrive between 5:40 and 6:00, so he has
20 minutes to do so. The probability of this is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{20}=\frac{1}{120}$.

$\bullet$ Alice arrives between 5:30 and 5:35. Bob has to arrive between 5:35 and 6:00, so he has
25 minutes to do so. The probability of this is $\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{25}=\frac{1}{150}$.

The total probability is then $\frac{1}{60}+\frac{1}{90}+\frac{1}{120}+\frac{1}{150}=\boxed{\frac{1}{36}}$.

There are 4 ways to pick the first girl and 3 ways to pick the second one; however, this counts each pair of girls twice since selecting girl A followed by girl B is the same as selecting girl B followed by girl A, so the total number of ways to pick the girls is $\frac{4\times3}{2}=6$. Similarly, there are 7 ways to pick the first boy, 6 ways to pick the second one, and 5 ways to pick the last one, but this counts each combination of boys 6 times since picking any of the three boys first followed by either of the other two followed by the third one will give the same triplet of boys. So the total number of ways to pick the boys is $\frac{7\times6\times5}{3\times2}=35$, and the total of number of ways to pick the students for the group presentation is $\frac{4\times3}{2}\cdot \frac{7\times6\times5}{3\times2}=\boxed{210}$

Extracting Answer from: 
We call a square with all its vertices on the grid a grid square. Note that there are 16 points along the top edge, 16 points along the bottom edge, 16 points along the left edge, and 16 points along the right edge. There are no grid squares that do not have at least one vertex on an edge of the grid, since all grid squares have to have sides parallel to the grid, and if a grid square had all its vertices in the interior of the grid, then it would have to be "tilted" to have sides parallel to the grid.

Case 1: A grid square with all its vertices on adjacent vertices of the grid.

If the square is 1 by 1, then there are 16 squares. If the square is 2 by 2, then there are 9 squares. If the square is 3 by 3, then there are 4 squares. If the square is 4 by 4, then there is 1 square. So there are $16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 30$ grid squares of this type.

Case 2: A grid square with all its vertices on non-adjacent vertices of the grid.

If the square is 2 by 2, then there are 4 squares. If the square is 3 by 3, then there is 1 square. So there are 5 grid squares of this type.

Combined with Case 1, we find that there are a total of $30 + 5 = \boxed{35}$ grid squares.

We instead find the probability that the sum of the numbers showing is not between 3 and 11.  Since each die's face contains the numbers 1-6, we see that this can only be the case if we roll two 1s or two 6s.  Thus the chance that the sum is not between 3 and 11 is $\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{6}$, or $\frac{1}{18}$.  So our desired probability is $1-\frac{1}{18} = \boxed{\frac{17}{18}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice, since each die has 6 possible outcomes and there are 6 choices for the first die and 6 choices for the second die. 

The only way to get a sum of 2 is to roll two 1s, which has probability $\dfrac{1}{36}$. Similarly, the only way to get a sum of 12 is to roll two 6s, which has probability also $\dfrac{1}{36}$. 

To get a sum of 3, one die must show a 1 and the other die must show a 2. There are two ways to do this (1-2 or 2-1) and each way has probability $\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} = \dfrac{1}{36}$. To get a sum of 4, there are three possible combinations: 1-3, 2-2, or 3-1. Each combination has probability $\dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} = \dfrac{1}{36}$, so the probability of getting a sum of 4 is $\dfrac{3}{36}$. We continue counting in this way to find the probabilities of getting sums of 5, 6, $\ldots$, 11, as shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
Sum & Probability \\ \hline
2 & $\dfrac{1}{36}$ \\
3 & $\dfrac{2}{36}$ \\
4 & $\dfrac{3}{36}$ \\
5 & $\dfrac{4}{36}$ \\
6 & $\dfrac{5}{36}$ \\
7 & $\dfrac{6}{36}$ \\
8 & $\dfrac{5}{36}$ \\
9 & $\dfrac{4}{36}$ \\
10 & $\dfrac{3}{36}$ \\
11 & $\dfrac{2}{36}$ \\
12 & $\dfrac{1}{36}$
\end{tabular}

The sum of the probabilities is $\dfrac{36}{36}$, so this table represents a probability distribution, and we can add up the probabilities for the desired outcomes to find the probability that the sum is between 3 and 11, inclusive:

\begin{align*}
&P(\text{sum between 3 and 11, inclusive}) \\
&= P(\text{sum is 3 or 4 or }\ldots\text{ or 11}) \\
&= P(\text{sum is 3}) + P(\text{sum is 4}) + \ldots + P(\text{sum is 11}) \\
&= \frac{2}{36} + \frac{3}{36} + \frac{4}{36} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{6}{36} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{4}{36} + \frac{3}{36} + \frac{2}{36} \\
&= \frac{32}{36} \\
&= \boxed{\frac{8}{9}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use complementary counting to solve this problem. First, we count the total number of ways to catch all seven creatures with no restrictions. This is simply $7!$, since all seven creatures are distinct.

Next, we count the number of ways to catch all seven creatures with two crocodiles caught consecutively. There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: Two crocodiles are caught as the first two creatures. There are 3 ways to choose which two crocodiles are caught, and then 5! ways to catch the remaining five creatures. So there are $3\times 5!$ ways to catch all seven creatures with two crocodiles caught consecutively in this case.

Case 2: Two crocodiles are caught as the second and third creatures. There are again 3 ways to choose which two crocodiles are caught, and then 4 ways to choose where they are caught among the first four creatures. Then there are 5! ways to catch the remaining five creatures. So there are $3\times 4\times 5!$ ways to catch all seven creatures with two crocodiles caught consecutively in this case.

Therefore, the total number of ways to catch all seven creatures with two crocodiles caught consecutively is $3\times 5! + 3\times 4\times 5! = 18\times 5!$.

Finally, we subtract this from the total number of ways to catch all seven creatures to get the number of ways to catch all seven creatures with no two crocodiles caught consecutively: $7! - 18\times 5! = \boxed{6,\!192}$.

We start with the numbers that start with 1.  There are 4 ways to pick the next digit, then 3 ways to pick the third digit, 2 ways to pick the fourth, and 1 to pick the last.  Therefore, there are $4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1=24$ integers with 1 as the first digit.  Similarly, another 24 have 2 as the first digit. That's 48 numbers so far, so we want the second smallest number that starts with 3.  The smallest is 31245, and the next smallest is $\boxed{31254}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We note that there are $4!=24$ positive integers whose first digit is 1. We also note that we can treat the other digits as though it were a four-digit integer in base 4 by considering the digits 2, 3, 4, and 5 as the digits 0,1,2, and 3 in base 4. Note that there are thus $3!=6$ permutations for each of these "base-4" numbers, as we would expect.
Therefore, the first $4!$ integers start with a 1, the second $4!$ start with a 2, and so on. Since $\frac{50}{24}$ is slightly greater than 2 but less than 3, the $50^{th}$ integer starts with a 3. The first $\frac{3!}{2!}\cdot2!=6$ of the numbers starting with 3 (in base-4) have a digit in the thousands place of 1, the second 6 have a digit in the thousands place of 2, and the last 6 have a digit in the thousands place of 3. $\frac{2\cdot3!}{2!}\cdot2!=12$ integers start with 31, $\frac{2\cdot3!}{2!}\cdot2!=12$ integers start with 32, and the $50^{th}$ integer in the list is the $2^{nd}$ integer that starts with 34; hence, the answer is $\boxed{34152}.$

For each of the first four prime numbers, the probability that Bob chooses 0 is $\frac{1}{p}$ and the probability that he chooses any other number is $\frac{p-1}{p}$. Therefore, the probability that he chooses a nonzero number for each of the four prime numbers is $(1-\frac{1}{2})(1-\frac{1}{3})(1-\frac{1}{5})(1-\frac{1}{7})=\frac{2}{15}$. 

Now, we need to find the probability that the sum of the chosen numbers is greater than 0. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the sum of the chosen numbers is not equal to 0. The only way the sum can be equal to 0 is if Bob chooses 0 for at least one of the prime numbers. Therefore, the probability that the sum is not equal to 0 is $1-\frac{2}{15}=\boxed{\frac{13}{15}}$.

The lattice points $(x,y)$ such that $-4\le y\le 4$ and $-5\le x\le 5$ form a rectangle that contains the given rectangle. Therefore, the number of lattice points in the interior of the given rectangle is the number of lattice points inside this rectangle that are not on its boundary. To count these points, we count the total number of lattice points in the rectangle and subtract the number of lattice points on the boundary.

The number of lattice points in the rectangle is $(2\cdot 4+1)(2\cdot 5+1) = 45$ (the number of possible $y$-coordinates is $2\cdot 4+1$ and the number of possible $x$-coordinates is $2\cdot 5+1$).

The number of lattice points on the boundary is $2\cdot 5+2\cdot 4 = 18$ (each of the four sides has length 10, so there are 10 boundary points on each side, but we've counted each of the four corner points twice, so we need to subtract 4).

Therefore, the number of lattice points in the interior of the given rectangle is $45-18 = \boxed{27}$.

If Polya is never to visit the sixth floor after she begins, we know that her first stop is at the seventh floor. Moreover, her second stop must be at the eighth floor. She has three moves left, and the only way she can ever visit the 6th floor from the 8th floor in three remaining moves is to go down in both of the following two steps. The probability of getting to the eighth step in two moves is $\frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}$. And the probability of not going downward in the next two steps is $1- \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$. So the overall probability of never hitting the sixth floor after the beginning is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{16}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
First notice that the first flip of the coin does not matter. Once Polya arrives at a floor above the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor, she will be making four coin flips and hoping that she gets heads each time. So the probability that she ends up on the $k^{\text{th}}$ floor or higher, when starting on the $6^{\text{th}}$, depends only on her distance from the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor. If she is $1$ floor below the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor, for example, then there is only one way in which all four of her remaining coin flips will be heads and she will arrive at the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor: they must all be heads. Since each of the $2^4$ possible results of the next four coin flips is equally likely, the probability she arrives on the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor from one floor below it is $\dfrac{1}{16}$. If Polya is $2$ floors below the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor, then she needs to get two more heads than tails, which can happen in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways. Thus, the probability she arrives on the $7^{\text{th}}$ floor from two floors below it is $\dfrac{6}{16}=\dfrac{3}{8}$. Continuing in this way, we see that the probability she ends up on the $k^{\text{th}}$ floor or higher, for $k=7,8,\ldots,15$, is $\dfrac{\binom{4}{k-7}}{16}$.

In order for Meena to win, she first must get to 10. Since the game is tied 8-8, we know that there must have been exactly 16 rounds played before Meena gained her ninth point. And since Bob has probability $\frac{1}{3}$ of scoring on each turn, the probability of 8 scores in the first 16 rounds is $\binom{16}{8}\left(\frac13\right)^8\left(\frac23\right)^8$.

Basically, Bob already had his chance and lost. From this point on, Meena $must$ win. There will be no more ties. Since every point scored from this point on will be scored by Meena, she has a $\boxed{1}$ chance of winning.

Extracting Answer from: 
We must find the probability that Joan can solve it at any time before the sixth try, so it is the sum of the probabilities that she will solve it on her first, second, third, fourth, and fifth tries.  We could evaluate all those cases, but seeing all that casework, we wonder if it will be easier to find the probability that she fails to solve it before 6 tries, and subtract the result from 1.

In order for her to fail to solve it before her sixth try, she must fail 5 times.  The probability of failure on each try is $1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}$, so the probability that she fails on each of her first 5 tries is $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5 = \frac{243}{1024}$.  Therefore, the probability that she succeeds before her sixth try is \[1-\frac{243}{1024} = \boxed{\frac{781}{1024}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a few different ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use the geometric distribution. If we let X be the number of days it takes Joan to solve the problem, then X follows a geometric distribution with probability of success p = 1/4.

The probability that Joan solves the problem on her first try is p = 1/4. The probability that she solves it on her second try is (1-p)p = (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16, since she must fail on the first try (with probability 3/4) and then succeed on the second try (with probability 1/4). Similarly, the probability that she solves it on her third try is (1-p)^2p = (3/4)^2(1/4) = 9/64, and so on.

To find the probability that she solves it before her sixth try, we can add up the probabilities of all the possible outcomes up to the fifth try. That is,

P(X < 6) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)
           = p + (1-p)p + (1-p)^2p + (1-p)^3p + (1-p)^4p
           = (1/4) + (3/16) + (9/64) + (27/256) + (81/1024)
           = 342/1024
           = 0.33496 (rounded to five decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that Joan will solve the problem before her sixth try is approximately 0.335.

We will use the inclusion-exclusion principle for this problem. The probability of getting a 5 on the first roll is obviously $\frac{1}{6}$, as it is on the second roll. So, the probability of getting a 5 on at least one of the rolls would appear to be $2\cdot \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. But this is not quite right. We have double counted the case of rolling a 5 twice. In that instance, we have included it in both the count for a 5 on the first roll and the second roll, when it only should have been included once overall. So, our answer is $\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{36} = \boxed{\frac{11}{36}}$.

There are $7^4$ equally likely possibilities for the day of the week on which each of the four people in question were born.  If exactly two of Amy's best friends were born on Tuesday, either both the friends and Amy were born on Tuesday or Tuesday is the day neither of her friends' were born.  In the first case, there are $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to choose which two of the three friends were born on Tuesday, and there is one way to choose which of the three remaining days of the week Amy was born on.  This gives $3$ ways for Amy and two friends to have been born on Tuesday.  In the second case, there are three choices for which friend was born on Tuesday, and then six choices for which day of the week each of the other two friends were born on.  This gives $3\cdot 6=18$ ways for Amy and two friends to not have been born on Tuesday.  Thus, the desired probability is $\frac{3}{7^3}+\frac{18}{7^3}=\boxed{\frac{3}{49}}$.

Consider one vertex of the cube. When the cube is rotated, there are 8 vertices which that vertex could end up at. At each of those vertices, there are 3 ways to rotate the cube onto itself with that vertex fixed. So, there are a total of $8\cdot3=24$ ways to rotate a cube. There are $8!$ ways to arrange the beads, not considering rotations. Since the arrangements come in groups of 24 equivalent arrangements, the actual number of ways to arrange the beads is $8!/24=\boxed{1680}$.

There are $8$ choices for the color of the bead at vertex $1$, $7$ choices remaining for the color of the bead at an adjacent vertex (without loss of generality, vertex $2$), and $5$ choices for the color of the bead adjacent to both vertices $1$ and $2$ (vertex $3$). We may assume without loss of generality that the bead at vertex $4$ is the same color as the bead at vertex $1$ (there are two cases: either the bead at vertex $4$ is the same color as the bead at vertex $1$, or it is not; these two cases are not distinct, since both cubes are rotationally equivalent). Therefore, there are $6$ choices for the color of the bead at vertex $5$ (since it cannot be the same color as the beads at vertices $1$ or $2$, nor the same color as the bead at vertex $4$). At this point, the remaining colors are uniquely determined, so there are $6!$ ways to place the remaining $6$ beads on the $6$ remaining vertices.

Think of continuing the drawing until all five chips are removed from the box. There are ten possible orderings of the colors: RRRWW, RRWRW, RWRRW, WRRRW, RRWWR, RWRWR, WRRWR, RWWRR, WRWRR, and WWRRR. The six orderings that end in R represent drawings that would have ended when the second white chip was drawn. Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white if we stop at the last red or the last white is $6/10 = \boxed{\frac{3}{5}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Without loss of generality, assume that the chips are labeled $W_1, W_2, R_1, R_2,$ and $R_3,$ and that they are drawn in that order. If the last chip drawn is white, then the first three chips drawn are $W_1, W_2,$ and $R_1$ in some order, since otherwise all the red chips would have been drawn first. The last chip is white if and only if the fourth chip drawn is $R_2$ and the fifth chip drawn is $R_3.$ There are ${3\choose 2}$ ways to choose which two of the three red chips are drawn first, and there are then $3\cdot 2 = 6$ ways to finish the sequence. So, there are ${3\choose 2}\cdot 6 = 18$ ways to draw the chips so that the last chip drawn is white. There are ${5\choose 3} = 10$ total possible sequences of draws, since we need to choose which three of the five chips are drawn first. Therefore, the probability that the last chip drawn is white is $\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}.$

The shaded squares are those that indicate that both remainders are odd or both are even. Hence the square is shaded with probability \[

Extracting Answer from: 
The first number on the wheel is equally likely to be $1,2,3,6,7,9$. Since we need to divide this number by $4$ and find the remainder, the possible remainders are $1, 2, 3$. The second number on the wheel is equally likely to be $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9$. Since we need to divide this number by $5$ and find the remainder, the possible remainders are $1, 2, 3, 4$. In order for the checker to be placed on a shaded square, the remainder of the first number when divided by 4 must be 2 or 3, and the remainder of the second number when divided by 5 must be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, there are $2\cdot3 = 6$ ways to place a checker on a shaded square.

There are a total of $6\cdot 4 = 24$ outcomes of choosing two numbers from the wheel. Each of these outcomes is equally likely, so the probability that a checker is placed on a shaded square is $\dfrac{6}{24}=\boxed{\frac14}$.

label("Math",2.4C,C); label("English",2.4B,B); label("Science", 2.4A,A);[/asy] We build this diagram by working from the inside out.  First, we put the 12 in the middle for the 12 students who do all three subjects.  We then take care of the other 3 overlap regions by subtracting this 12 from each of the totals of students who did a pair of subjects.  Finally, we can find out the number of students who did only math by subtracting from 59 (the number of students who did math homework) the numbers in the math-and-other-subjects overlaps.  We can then do the same for the other subjects.  Adding all the numbers in the diagram, we see that there are 82 students who did some homework, so there are $100-82=\boxed{18}$ who did no homework at all.

Alternatively, we could solve this problem by first adding the number of students for each subject.  But students who do two subjects are counted twice, so we subtract the doubles (students doing homework for 2 subjects).  Now, we've added the students who did all three subjects three times (adding them in for each subject) and we've subtracted them three times (once for each "double" a student who did all three subjects is in).  So, we haven't counted them at all!  So, we have to add these "triples" back in!  This gives a total of  $$59+49+42-20-29-31+12=82$$ students.  There are 100 students total, so there are $100-82 = \boxed{18}$ students who did no homework.

To solve the problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We start by adding the number of students who did each type of homework:

59 + 49 + 42 = 150

However, this counts some students twice: those who did both English and science, both science and math, and both math and English. So we need to subtract them:

150 - 20 - 29 - 31 = 70

However, this counts some students three times: those who did all three types of homework. So we need to add them back:

70 + 12 = 82

Therefore, 82 students did at least one type of homework. To find the number of students who did none of the homework, we subtract this from the total number of students:

100 - 82 = 18

Therefore, 18 students did no math, no English and no science homework.

The color of the center square is unrestricted, so we can call that color 1.

If, without loss of generality, we assign color 2 to the top left corner, the vertical line of symmetry forces the top right square to also be color 2, and the diagonal line of symmetry forces the bottom right square to be color 2, which then, by the vertical line of symmetry, forces the bottom left square to be color 2.

Finally, if, without loss of generality, we assign color 3 to the top middle square, the diagonal line of symmetry forces the right middle square to be color 3, which then, by the vertical line of symmetry, forces the left middle square to be color 3, and this then forces the bottom middle square to also be color 3, by the diagonal line of symmetry. Thus, at most $\boxed{3}$ colors may be used.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by using only two colors. One color goes in the middle, and another color goes in the four corner squares. We have to choose a color for the top and bottom squares that are connected by the vertical line of symmetry. We can’t color them both with the same color or else that would add an extra line of symmetry that we don’t want. So let’s color one of them with the same color as the middle. Then, the other square has to be colored with the same color as one of the two squares on the left or right that are connected by the horizontal line of symmetry. Without loss of generality, suppose that we choose the middle color. Now we have colored everything on the left side, so the right side must be colored in the same way. Therefore, with two colors there is only one way to paint the 3 by 3 grid.

[asy] unitsize(4mm); defaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)+fontsize(12pt)); for (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {draw((0,i)--(3,i));draw((i,0)--(i,3));} fill((0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,0)--cycle,gray);fill((1,0)--(1,1)--(2,1)--(2,0)--cycle,white);fill((1,2)--(1,3)--(2,3)--(2,2)--cycle,white);dot((1.5,0));dot((1.5,3)); draw((1.5,-.3)--(1.5,3.3),dashed); draw((-0.3,-0.3)--(3.3,3.3),dashed); [/asy]

Next, we see that using three colors is impossible. If we color the middle square one color, we are forced to color the two squares on the sides of the vertical line of symmetry with that same color. Then we color the four corner squares with the other two colors. Without loss of generality, assume that we paint one of the remaining squares on the left side red. Then the two squares on top (one above the red square and one above the vertical line of symmetry) must be blue, so that the two long rectangles on the left are both the same color. But now the square on the upper right must be red, which is a contradiction because there are now two red squares in the top row. Therefore, it is impossible to use three colors.

We conclude that the maximum number of colors that can be used is $\boxed{2}$.

It's easy to count the number of three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7: the smallest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $15 \times 7 = 105$, and the largest multiple of 7 which is a three-digit number is $142 \times 7 = 994$.  Therefore, there are $142-15+1 = 128$ three-digit numbers which are multiples of 7.  There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999), so there are $900-128 = \boxed{772}$ three-digit numbers which are not multiples of 7.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first count how many three-digit numbers are multiples of 7, and then subtract that count from the total number of three-digit numbers.

The first three-digit multiple of 7 is $7\times 14 = 98$, since if we added 7 to this we would get a four-digit number. The last three-digit multiple of 7 is $7\times 142 = 994$, since if we added 7 to this we would get a four-digit number. To count how many numbers are in this list, we divide the difference between them by 7 and add 1: 

$$
\frac{994 - 98}{7} + 1 = 128.
$$

So there are 128 three-digit multiples of 7.

The total number of three-digit numbers is the difference between the last three-digit number (999) and the first three-digit number (100), plus 1, for a total of $999-100+1=900$.

Therefore the total number of three-digit numbers that are not multiples of 7 is $900-128=\boxed{772}$.

The easiest solution is to find the number of positive integers with only 2 and 3 as their prime factors. If the number has no factors of 3, the qualifying numbers are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$ for 7 total. If there is one factor of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^1, 2^1 \cdot 3^1, 2^2 \cdot 3^1, 2^3 \cdot 3^1, 2^4 \cdot 3^1, 2^5 \cdot 3^1$ for 6 total. With two factors of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^2, 2^1 \cdot 3^2, 2^2 \cdot 3^2, 2^3 \cdot 3^2$ for 4 total. With three factors of 3, we have $2^0 \cdot 3^3, 2^1 \cdot 3^3$ for 2 total. Finally, $3^4$ gives us 1 more. So, there are $7+ 6+4+2+1 = 20$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have only 2 and 3 as prime factors. Therefore, there are $100-20 = \boxed{80}$ positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4.

First, we count the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have no prime factor greater than 4. This means that the prime factorization of each integer consists only of 2's and 3's. We consider integers of the form $2^a3^b$, where $0\leq a,b\leq 4$, and count the number of possibilities for $a$ and $b$. There are 5 choices for $a$ ($0$ through $4$), and 5 choices for $b$. Therefore, there are $5\cdot 5 = 25$ integers less than or equal to 100 that have no prime factor greater than 4. 

To find the number of positive integers less than or equal to 100 that have a prime factor greater than 4, we subtract the number of integers with no prime factor greater than 4 from the total number of integers less than or equal to 100:

Let the probabilities of rolling 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on each die be $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_6$ and $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_6,$ respectively. We are given that

Since the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes of each die is 1, $kp_1 + kp_2 + \dots +kp_6 = 1$ and $kq_1 + kq_2 + \dots + kq_6 = 1.$ Therefore,

The prime factors of $20$ are $2\cdot 2\cdot 5$. Thus, $20$ is not prime, and there is $\boxed{0}$ prime in the row.

Extracting Answer from: 
We pretend that the letters are all different, and we have P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$.  We have $4!$ permutations (since all the letters are different).

But how many arrangements of P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$ (where the P's and A's are considered different) correspond to a single arrangement of PAPA (where the P's and A's are identical)?  PAPA is counted in 4 different ways: as P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$, P$_1$A$_2$P$_2$A$_1$, P$_2$A$_1$P$_1$A$_2$, and P$_2$A$_2$P$_1$A$_1$.  Rather than list out the possibilities, we could have reasoned as follows: For the 2 P's, each possibility is counted $2! = 2$ times, and for the 2 A's, each of these 2 possibilities is counted $2! = 2$ times, for a total of $2 \times 2 = 4$ ways. (Make sure you see why it isn't $2+2 = 4$ ways.) Therefore, there are 4! ways to arrange the 4 letters P$_1$A$_1$P$_2$A$_2$; this counts each arrangement of PAPA $2! \times 2! = 4$ times, so we have $4!/(2! \times 2!) = \boxed{6}$ ways to arrange PAPA.

We begin by computing $301^2$. Notice that $301=300+1$, so we can apply the difference of squares factorization: \begin{align*}

301^4&=\left(301^2\right)^2\\
&=(90{,}601)^2\\

To solve this problem, we need to use combinations. The formula for combinations is:

nCr = n! / r!(n-r)!

where n is the total number of items to choose from, r is the number of items we want to choose, and ! means factorial (you multiply all the numbers from 1 to that number).

In this case, n = 9 (the number of toppings available) and r = 2 (the number of toppings we want on our pizza). So we can write:

9C2 = 9! / 2!(9-2)!
= 9! / 2!7!
= (9 x 8 x 7!) / (2 x 1 x 7!)
= (9 x 4)
= 36

Therefore, Sarah can order 36 different pizzas with 2 different toppings out of 9 options.

Let $w$ and $l$ be the respective number of wins and losses a team has. We are told that $$\frac{l}{w}= \frac{7}{13},$$which implies that $w:l=13:7$. Thus, for every $20$ games, the team has $13$ wins and $7$ losses.

In probability terms, the probability of winning a game is equal to the fraction of games won among all games played, which is $$\frac{\text{number of wins}}{\text{number of wins} + \text{number of losses}} = \frac{13}{13+7} = \frac{13}{20}.$$Therefore, the probability of winning the next game is $\frac{13}{20}=\boxed{65\%}$.

Let's first consider the case where all four circles intersect at a single point. In this case, there are no other points of intersection.

Now let's consider the case where three circles intersect at a single point, and the fourth circle intersects each of the other three circles. In this case, there are three points of intersection where the three circles meet, and three more points of intersection where the fourth circle intersects each of the others, for a total of six points of intersection.

Finally, let's consider the case where no three circles intersect at a single point. In this case, each pair of circles must intersect at two points. There are six pairs of circles, so there are $2 \cdot 6 = 12$ points of intersection.

Therefore, the maximum number of points where at least two of the circles intersect is $\boxed{12}$.

There are $2^6 = 64$ ways to assign the six friends to chemistry or biology without any restrictions. However, if Manoj refuses to be in a class without any of his friends, we must subtract the number of assignments where Manoj is the only one in a class. If Manoj is in chemistry, there are $2^5$ ways to assign the rest of the friends to either chemistry or biology. Similarly, if Manoj is in biology, there are also $2^5$ ways to assign the rest of the friends. However, we have subtracted the case where Manoj is the only one in a class twice, so we must add it back in. There are $2^4$ ways for the remaining friends to choose their classes if only Manoj is excluded. Therefore, the total number of ways to assign the friends is $2^6 - (2^5 + 2^5 - 2^4) = \boxed{26}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when the two dice are rolled. 

We need to find the probability of getting an odd sum. There are two cases to consider: 

Case 1: The sum is odd and both dice show odd numbers. 
The only odd number on the first die is 3, and the only odd number on the second die is 5. So the probability of this case is: 

(1/2) x (1/2) = 1/4 

Case 2: The sum is odd and one die shows an even number and the other die shows an odd number. 
For the sum to be odd, the even number on one die has to be 2 and the odd number on the other die has to be 3 or 5. There are two ways to get this outcome: 

- First die shows 2 and second die shows 3 
- First die shows 2 and second die shows 5 

Each of these outcomes has probability 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36. So the total probability for Case 2 is: 

2 x 1/36 = 1/18 

Therefore, the total probability of getting an odd sum is: 

1/4 + 1/18 = 7/36

Extracting Answer from: 
If we want the largest such $n$, we must count the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of $200!$. The number of multiples of 3 is $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3} \right\rfloor$.  (The notation $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3}\right\rfloor$ means ``divide 200 by 3 and round down.")   However, these are not the only factors of 3 in the product!  Multiples of 9 in the product contribute an extra factor of 3. There are $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{9} \right\rfloor$ of these, so we add this number to the $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3}\right\rfloor$ factors of 3 we found from counting multiples of 3.  Similarly, we must add in multiples of 27 once and multiples of 81.

The sum is $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{27} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{81} \right\rfloor = 66 + 22 + 7 + 2 = \boxed{97}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The largest power of 3 that divides $15!$ is $\left\lfloor\frac{15}{3}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{15}{9}\right\rfloor=5+1=6$. Therefore, a power of 3 greater than 6 cannot be a factor of $15!$. We check the exponents 1 through 6 to see how many of them divide $15!$. The largest multiple of each exponent that does not exceed 15 is listed.

$3^1$ divides $15$, $12$, $9$, $6$, $3$. This gives us $5$ values of $n$.

$3^2$ divides $9$, $6$, $3$. This gives us $3$ more values.

$3^3$ divides $9$, $3$. This gives us $2$ more values.

$3^4$ and higher divide at most $3$, which has already been included.

Thus there are $5+3+2=\boxed{10}$ allowable values of $n$.

If the number is divisible by $3$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $3$.  So $a+b$ must be one more than a multiple of $3$, since $5$ is one less than a multiple of $3$.  We have several options:

If $a+b=1$, it must be $(1,0)$, one possibility.

For $a+b=4$, $a$ can be $1$ to $4$, for four possibilities.

For $a+b=7$, $a$ can be $1$ to $7$, so seven possibilities.

For $a+b=10$, anything from $(1,9)$ to $(9,1)$ works, so nine possibilities.

For $a+b=13$, the pairs range from $(4,9)$ to $(9,4)$, for six possibilities.

If $a+b=16$, we can have $(7,9)$, $(8,8)$, or $(9,7)$, so three possibilities.

$a+b=19$ and up is not possible.

Extracting Answer from: 
In a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. Therefore, $a+b+5$ must be divisible by 3. It is clear that for $a$ and $b$ between 0 and 9, inclusive, there is exactly one choice of $a$ and $b$ that will make $a+b+5$ a multiple of 3.

If $a+b+5=3$, we must have $a+b=-2$, which is impossible.

If $a+b+5=6$, we have $a+b=1$, which yields only 10.

If $a+b+5=9$, we have $a+b=4$, which yields two numbers:  49 and 94.

Similarly, for $a+b+5=12$, $a+b=7$ and the solution is 76.

For $a+b+5=15$, $a+b=10$ and the only solution is 10.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{4}$ three-digit numbers that meet the conditions.

This is just  $\binom{3}{2}\cdot \binom{25}{2} + \binom{3}{3}\cdot\binom{25}{1} = 925$, since we can choose either 2 or 3 of the top students to be in this group.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $C(28,4)=20475$ total possible groups of four students. We will consider the number of groups of four that do not include at least two of the top three geography students.

There are $C(25,4)=12650$ groups of four that do not include any of the top three geography students. There are $C(3,1)\cdot C(25,3)=21675$ groups of four that include exactly one of the top three geography students. Note that we multiply by $C(3,1)$ to choose which of the top three students will be in the group. Finally, there are $C(3,2)\cdot C(25,2)=5250$ groups of four that include exactly two of the top three geography students. Note that we multiply by $C(3,2)$ to choose which two of the top three students will be in the group.

Therefore, there are $12650+21675+5250=39575$ groups of four that do not include at least two of the top three geography students. The probability that a randomly chosen group of four students does not include at least two of the top three geography students is $\dfrac{39575}{20475}=\dfrac{761}{395}$. So, the probability that a randomly chosen group of four students includes at least two of the top three geography students is $1-\dfrac{761}{395}=\boxed{\dfrac{126}{395}}$.

Alternatively, we can find the number of groups that do include at least two of the top three students, and then subtract this from the total number of groups.

There are $3$ ways to choose which top $3$ students are in the group, and $C(25,1)=25$ ways to choose one more student from the remaining $25$. Altogether, there are $3\cdot 25 = 75$ groups that include exactly $3$ of the top $3$ students.

There are $3$ ways to choose which top $3$ students are in the group, and $C(25,2)=300$ ways to choose the other two students. Altogether, there are $3\cdot300=900$ groups that include exactly $2$ of the top $3$ students.

Therefore, there are $75+900=975$ groups of four that include at least two of the top three geography students. The probability that a randomly chosen group of four students does include at least two of the top three geography students is $\dfrac{975}{20475}=\boxed{\dfrac{126}{395}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use binomial probability to solve this problem. Let's let success be finding treasure on an island, so the probability of success is $p=\frac{1}{5}$ and the probability of failure (not finding treasure) is $q=1-p=\frac{4}{5}$. We want to find the probability of getting exactly 4 successes in 7 trials (visiting 7 islands). This is given by the binomial probability formula:

$$P(X=4)=\binom{7}{4}p^4q^3$$

where $\binom{7}{4}$ is the number of ways to choose 4 islands out of 7 to have treasure. Plugging in the values, we get:

$$P(X=4)=\binom{7}{4}\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^4\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^3$$

$$P(X=4)=\frac{35\times 1}{5^4\times 4^3}=\frac{35}{4^3\times 5^4}=\boxed{\frac{7}{5000}}$$

Therefore, the probability that exactly 4 of the islands have treasure is $\boxed{\frac{7}{5000}}$.

When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.

Therefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\frac{100}{190}=\boxed{\frac{10}{19}}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, note that any two vertices of the dodecahedron must be connected by a line that lies inside the dodecahedron, on one of the faces. Since there are ${20 \choose 2} = 190$ pairs of distinct vertices, and each pair is connected by a line that lies on one of the faces of the dodecahedron, there are $190\cdot 12 = 2280$ pairs of vertices that are connected by a line that lies on the surface of the dodecahedron.

Next, note that if a pair of vertices is connected by a line that lies inside the dodecahedron, then the line must pass through one of the $20$ faces of the dodecahedron. 

For any given face of the dodecahedron, there are 10 vertices that do not lie on the face, and hence do not form a line that passes through the face. Therefore, there are ${10 \choose 2} = 45$ pairs of vertices that are connected by a line passing through any given face of the dodecahedron.

Since there are 20 faces, there are $20\cdot 45 = 900$ pairs of vertices that are connected by a line that passes through any face of the dodecahedron.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen pair of vertices is connected by a line that lies inside the dodecahedron is $\frac{2280-900}{190\cdot 12} = \boxed{\frac{17}{38}}$.

We can use the formula for combinations to solve this problem:

In this case, we want to choose 2 toppings out of 8, so n = 8 and k = 2. 

8 C 2 = 8! / (2! * (8-2)!) 
= 8! / (2! * 6!) 
= (8 * 7 * 6!) / (2 * 1 * 6!)

Let the two random numbers be $x$ and $y$. In order to form an obtuse triangle, since 1 will be the longest side, we must simultaneously satisfy the following inequalities: $$x+y>1\text{ and }x^2+y^2<1.$$The first is the triangle inequality and the second guarantees that the triangle is obtuse. Graphing these in the $xy$-plane, we get the following shaded region. [asy]

Without loss of generality, suppose he first obtains the number $x$. Then $1-x$ is the length of the second side, and we want $|1-x - x|$ to be less than $1$ so that the three numbers can form a triangle. This occurs if and only if $\frac{1}{2} < x < 1$, in which case\begin{align*}
P[x \text{ first}] &= \int_{1/2}^{1} (\log_2(2) - \log_2(1-x) - \log_2(x)) dx \\
&= \int_{1/2}^{1} \log_2 \left(\frac{2}{x(1-x)}\right) dx \\
&= \frac{5}{4}\log_2(2) - \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3) - \frac{1}{2}\log_2(2) \\
&= \frac{5}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3).
\end{align*}Similarly, if he first obtains $1-x$, the same condition must be satisfied on $x$, and thus\begin{align*}
P[1-x \text{ first}] &= \int_{1/2}^{1} (\log_2(2) - \log_2(x) - \log_2(1-x)) dx \\
&= \frac{5}{4} - \frac{1}{2}\log_2(3).
\end{align*}The answer is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $\frac{5}{2} - \log_2(3)$. Thus, $4p = \boxed{10 - 4\log_2(3)}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The probability of getting a 6 in any one roll is $\dfrac{1}{6}$. We want to calculate the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 rolls, which means we want to calculate the probability of getting zero, one, or two 6's.

First, let's calculate the probability of getting zero 6's. The probability of not getting a 6 on any one roll is $\dfrac{5}{6}$. The probability of not getting a 6 on any of the 5 rolls is $\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^5$. Therefore, the probability of getting zero 6's is $1 - \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^5$.

Next, let's calculate the probability of getting exactly one 6. There are 5 ways to choose the roll that we get a 6, and the probability of getting a 6 on that roll is $\dfrac{1}{6}$. The probability of not getting a 6 on the other 4 rolls is $\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4$. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly one 6 is $5 \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4$.

Finally, let's calculate the probability of getting exactly two 6's. There are ${5 \choose 2} = 10$ ways to choose which 2 rolls we get 6's on, and the probability of getting a 6 on each of those rolls is $\dfrac{1}{6}$. The probability of not getting a 6 on the other 3 rolls is $\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^3$. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two 6's is ${5 \choose 2} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^3$

Adding up these three probabilities, we get:

\begin{align*}
&\left(1 - \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^5\right) + \left(5 \cdot \dfrac{1}{6} \cdot \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4\right) + \left({5 \choose 2} \cdot \left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^3\right) \\
&= 1 - \left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^5 + \dfrac{5}{6}\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^4 + \dfrac{10}{36}\left(\dfrac{5}{6}\right)^3 \\
&= \boxed{0.598\ldots}.

The number of times that each student is counted in this total is equal to the number of teams that student plays on. This means that all 60 students will be counted at least once, all students who play exactly two sports will be counted one extra time, and all students who play three sports will be counted two extra times. Letting $x$ be the number of students who play two sports and $y$ be the number who play all three gives us $60+x+2y=90$. However, we know that $y=8$, so we can substitute that in and get $x=\boxed{14}$.

Let the size of the basketball team be $2b$, the size of the math team be $3b$, and the size of the soccer team be $4b$. We know that $b+2b+3b=60$, so $b=15$. This means that there are 30 basketball players, 45 mathletes, and 60 soccer players. 

We want to find the number of students who play on exactly two teams. Let $x$ be the number of students who play basketball and soccer, $y$ be the number of students who play basketball and mathletics, and $z$ be the number of students who play mathletics and soccer. We are given that $8$ students play all three sports, so the number of students who play exactly two sports is $x+y+z-8$. 

We know that half the students (i.e. 30) play basketball, so $x+y=30$. We also know that the ratio of the sizes of the teams is $4:3:2$, so the number of students playing mathletics and soccer is $\frac{4}{2+3+4}\cdot60=24$. Therefore, $z=24-x$. Finally, we have the equation $\frac{3b}{2b}=\frac{45}{x+y}$, which simplifies to $\frac32=\frac{45}{30-x}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=15$. 

Substituting this value for $x$ into $x+y=30$ and $z=24-x$, we get $y=15$ and $z=9$. Therefore, the number of students who play on exactly two teams is $x+y+z-8=15+15+9-8=\boxed{31}$.

This problem requires a little bit of casework.  There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\dfrac{1}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\dfrac{2}{10}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\left(\dfrac{2}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{4}{100}$, the probability of getting a 3 is $\dfrac{3}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\left(\dfrac{3}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{9}{100}$ and the probability of getting a 4 is $\dfrac{4}{10}$, so the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\left(\dfrac{4}{10}\right)^2=\dfrac{16}{100}$. So our answer is $\dfrac{1}{100}+\dfrac{4}{100}+\dfrac{9}{100}+\dfrac{16}{100}=\frac{30}{100}=\boxed{\dfrac{3}{10}}$.

There are two cases to consider: either Phil and Sarah both spin a 1, 2, 3, or 4, or Phil and Sarah both spin different numbers. 

The probability that both Phil and Sarah spin a 1 is $\left(\frac{1}{10}\right)\left(\frac{1}{10}\right) = \frac{1}{100}$. Similarly, the probability that they both spin a 2, 3, or 4 is $\frac{4}{100}$, $\frac{9}{100}$, and $\frac{16}{100}$, respectively. Thus, the total probability of them both spinning the same number is:

$$\frac{1}{100} + \frac{4}{100} + \frac{9}{100} + \frac{16}{100} = \frac{30}{100} = \boxed{\frac{3}{10}}.$$

There are  $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to pick which $2$ of the $4$ spins will come up red. Each spin has a $1/4$ chance of coming up red, and $3/4$ chance of not coming up red, so once we pick which $2$ spins we want to come up red, there is a $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\!2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\!2}$ chance that the two spins we pick come up red and the other two do not. So, there is a $$6\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{\!2}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{\!2}=\frac{27}{128}$$chance that exactly $2$ come up red.

There are  $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to pick which 3 of the 4 spins will point to an arm. Each spin has a $1/2$ chance of pointing to an arm, and $1/2$ chance of not pointing to an arm, so once we pick which $3$ spins we want to point to an arm, there is a $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!1}$ chance that the three spins we pick come up arm and the other one does not. So, there is a $$4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\!1} = \frac{1}{4}$$chance that exactly $3$ spins point to an arm.

The color selection and limb selection are independent events, so the probability that they both happen is the product of their individual probabilities; $\frac{27}{128} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{27}{512}}$.

There are $2^4 = 16$ possible sequences of arms and legs that can occur. We wish to count the sequences in which exactly three of them are arms. There are ${4\choose3}=4$ ways to choose the three spins that will be arms. The other spin must be a leg. Therefore, the number of such sequences is 4. Finally, among these four sequences of legs and arms, we need two to be red.

The probability of drawing a white ball on the first draw is $\dfrac{3}{9}=\dfrac{1}{3}$. (There are 3 white balls in a total of 9 balls.) 

After the first draw, there are 8 balls remaining in the box, including 2 white balls. Therefore, the probability of drawing a white ball on the second draw, given that the first ball was white, is $\dfrac{2}{8}=\dfrac{1}{4}$. 

Using the Multiplication Rule of Probability, the probability of both events (drawing a white ball on the first draw, and then drawing a white ball on the second draw) happening is:

The expansion of $(x+y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$, by the Binomial Theorem.

The expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.

We can find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in each term separately and add them together. For the first term, we use the binomial theorem:

$$(x+y)^4 = \binom{4}{0}x^4y^0 + \binom{4}{1}x^3y^1 + \binom{4}{2}x^2y^2 + \binom{4}{3}x^1y^3 + \binom{4}{4}x^0y^4$$

The coefficient of $x^2y^2$ here is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$.

For the second term, we can use the binomial theorem again:

$$(x+2y)^4 = \binom{4}{0}x^4(2y)^0 + \binom{4}{1}x^3(2y)^1 + \binom{4}{2}x^2(2y)^2 + \binom{4}{3}x^1(2y)^3 + \binom{4}{4}x^0(2y)^4$$

The coefficient of $x^2y^2$ here is $\binom{4}{2}(2)^2 = 24$.

Adding these together, we get a total coefficient of $6+24=\boxed{30}$.

There are two ways in which the ant can return to his original vertex: either he can go part of the way around the hexagon and then retrace his steps, or he can go all the way around the hexagon. In the first case, the ant necessarily moves an even number of steps, because his total number of steps is twice the number of steps needed to get to the point at which he begins to retrace. In the second case, because a hexagon has an even number of vertices, the ant is again moving an even number of steps. Thus, he has no way to return to the vertex on which he began in an odd number of steps, so the probability is $\boxed{0}$.

The ant can only end up back at his starting vertex if he makes a series of moves that ultimately takes him around the entire hexagon (either clockwise or counterclockwise) and returns him to where he began. There are six such paths.

[asy]
pair A,B,C,D,E,F;
A = (0,0);
B = (1,0);
C = (1.5,sqrt(3)/2);
D = (1, sqrt(3));
E = (0,sqrt(3));
F = (-0.5,sqrt(3)/2);
draw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);
label("1", A, N);
label("2", B, N);
label("3", C, dir(60));
label("4", D, S);
label("5", E, S);
label("6", F, dir(240));
[/asy]

The path labeled 1 corresponds to staying put for all $15$ steps. The paths labeled 2 through 6 correspond to making $5$ steps around the hexagon, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

To count the number of ways to make each of these paths, we count the number of ways to choose the direction of each step. For path 1, there is only one choice for each step, so there is $1$ way to make this path.

For paths 2 through 6, there are $2$ choices of direction for each of the $5$ steps. Therefore, there are $2^5=32$ ways to make each of these paths.

The number of possible rolls of 5 dice is $6^5$, since there are 6 possibilities for each of the 5 dice.  Now we count the number of ways to get a 1 or a 2 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls. First, we pick which 3 of the 5 rolls are 1 or 2: we can do that in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways.  Now for each of these 3 rolls, there are 2 choices, and for each of the other 2 rolls, there are 4 choices.  Thus the probability is \[\frac{\binom{5}{3}2^34^2}{6^5}=\boxed{\frac{40}{243}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a few different ways we could approach this problem, but one common method is to use the binomial distribution. Specifically, we can think of each roll as a "success" (if it's a 1 or a 2) or a "failure" (if it's anything else), and then count the number of ways to get exactly 3 successes out of 5 trials.

The probability of a single roll being a success is $\frac{1}{3}$ (since there are 2 "successful" outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes). Therefore, the probability of a single roll being a failure is $1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.

Now we can use the binomial formula to calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 successes out of 5 trials:

$P(\text{3 successes}) = {5\choose3} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$

Here, ${5\choose3}$ represents the number of ways to choose 3 rolls out of 5 to be successes (which is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$), and $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3$ represents the probability of getting 3 successes in a row. Similarly, $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2$ represents the probability of getting 2 failures in a row.

Plugging in these values and simplifying, we get:

$P(\text{3 successes}) = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{27} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = \frac{40}{243} \approx 0.1646$

Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 rolls that are either a 1 or a 2 is about 0.1646, or approximately 16.5%.

Since the plants are indistinguishable, we must only count the number of plants on each window sill.

If all the plants are on one window  sill, there are $3$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.

If $5$ plants are on one window sill and the last is on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants go on which window sill.

If $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are on another, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which window sill they are on.

If $4$ plants are on one window sill and the last two are each on one of the other windows, there are $3$ ways to choose which window the $4$ plants are on.

If $3$ plants are on one window and the other $3$ plants are all on another window, there are $3$ ways to choose which window has no plants.

If $3$ plants are on one window, $2$ plants on another window, and $1$ plant on the last window, there are $3!=6$ ways to choose which plants are on which windows.

If $2$ plants are on each window, there is only one way to arrange them.

In total, there are $3+6+6+3+3+6+1=\boxed{28}$ ways to arrange the plants on the window sills.

See if you can find a faster way to do this problem by considering lining up the plants, and placing two dividers among the plants to separate them into three groups corresponding to the sills.

The first digit can be any one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Whatever the first digit is, that fixes what the units digit can be.  If we are going to have an even integer, the units digit must be even.  This restricts the first digit to 2, 4 or 6.  Then, there are 10 choices for the next (thousands) digit. That fixes what the tens digit can be.  Finally, there are 10 choices for the third (hundreds) digit.  So, we can construct $3\times10\times10= \boxed{300}$ palindromes by choosing the digits.

To create a palindrome, we only need to choose the first three digits, because the second two digits will then be determined (since they have to match the first two digits). 

There are 6 choices for the first digit (namely 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), and 10 choices for the second and third digits (since they can be any digit from 0 to 9). This gives us a total of $6 \times 10 \times 10 = 600$ possible palindromes.

However, we need to make sure that each palindrome is even. This means that the last digit must be even. So we need to cut our count in half, giving us a final answer of:

Let $p$ be the probability of flipping heads and $q$ be the probability of flipping tails. We are told that $p = 2q$ and $p+q = 1$, so solving for $p$ and $q$ yields $p = \frac{2}{3}$ and $q = \frac{1}{3}$.

To find the probability of getting exactly three heads, we need to use the binomial probability formula: $$P(\textrm{3 heads}) = \binom{8}{3} p^3 q^5.$$ Using the same formula for getting exactly two heads, we have $$P(\textrm{2 heads}) = \binom{8}{2} p^2 q^6.$$ Therefore, the ratio of these probabilities is \begin{align*}
\frac{P(\textrm{3 heads})}{P(\textrm{2 heads})} &= \frac{\binom{8}{3} p^3 q^5}{\binom{8}{2} p^2 q^6} \\
&= \frac{\frac{8!}{3!5!} (\frac{2}{3})^3 (\frac{1}{3})^5}{\frac{8!}{2!6!} (\frac{2}{3})^2 (\frac{1}{3})^6} \\
&= \frac{56}{28} \\
&= \boxed{2}.
\end{align*} So Phillip is twice as likely to get exactly three heads than exactly two heads.

After Alice puts the ball into Bob's bag, his bag will contain six balls: two of one color and one of each of the other colors. After Bob selects a ball and places it into Alice's bag, the two bags will have the same contents if and only if Bob picked one of the two balls in his bag that are the same color. Because there are six balls in the bag when Bob makes his selection, the probability of selecting one of the same colored pair is $2/6=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first think about the possible outcomes of this process. There are $5$ balls in each bag, so there are $5^2 = 25$ possible pairs of balls that can be selected. For each pair, there are two possible outcomes depending on which ball is moved from one bag to the other. So, there are $2\cdot25 = 50$ total outcomes.

Now, let's count how many of these outcomes result in the contents of the two bags being the same. There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: Alice moves a ball of a certain color into Bob's bag, and then Bob moves the same color ball back into Alice's bag. There are $5$ ways for Alice to choose the ball to give to Bob, and for each choice, there is only $1$ ball in Bob's bag that will result in the same color being moved back into Alice's bag. Therefore, there are $5$ outcomes in this case.

Case 2: Alice moves a ball of a certain color into Bob's bag, and then Bob moves a different color ball back into Alice's bag. There are $5$ ways for Alice to choose the ball to give to Bob, and for each choice, there are $4$ possible balls in Bob's bag that could be moved back into Alice's bag. Therefore, there are $5\cdot4 = 20$ outcomes in this case.

So, out of the $50$ possible outcomes, $5+20=25$ result in the contents of the two bags being the same. Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\dfrac{25}{50} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

The point can be randomly selected anywhere inside the orange square, which has area $10\cdot10=100$. The point satisfies the given inequality if it lies within the shaded region (the diagonal side of the shaded region is a segment of the line $2x+5y=20$). We will find its area by subtracting the area of the non-shaded region from the area of the square. The non-shaded region is a triangle with base of length 10 and height of length 4, so its area is $\frac{10\cdot4}{2}=20$. The area of the shaded region is then $100-20=80$. So the probability that the point falls within the shaded region is $80/100=\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/439_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To graph the inequality $2x+5y \geq 20$, we’ll use the technique of test points. We’ll pick a few test points, verify which side satisfies the inequality, and note the region for which this occurs. For example, pick $(x,y)=(0,0)$.

Substituting $0$ for both $x$ and $y$ we get $2(0)+5(0) \geq 20$ which simplifies to $0 \geq 20$. This is false. Since $(0,0)$ doesn’t satisfy the inequality, it should be on the other side of the boundary line. Since the inequality is an equation (i.e., $2x + 5y = 20$) when $x = 10$, we might also use $(x,y)=(10,0)$ as a test point. Plugging these values into the inequality, we get $2(10)+5(0)\geq 20$ which simplifies to $20\geq 20$. This is true. Therefore $(10,0)$ satisfies the inequality and should also be on the same side of the boundary line as $(0,0)$.

Thus, the coordinates that satisfy the inequality $2x+5y \geq 20$ describe the region to the left or on the boundary line $2x+5y=20$. Out of all possible coordinates $(x,y)$ in the range $0\leq x,y \leq 10$, the coordinates that lie in this region are the pairs $(x,y)$ for which $2x+5y\geq 20.$ Now we find the area of this region to determine the probability that a randomly selected point is in this region.

If we draw the boundary line $2x+5y=20$, we can find the $x$ and $y$ intercepts. We see that when $x=0$, $y=4$ and when $y=0$, $x=10$. Plot those points, connect them to form the boundary, and shade everything to the left. The graph is a trapezoid with bases $4$ and $10$ and height $4$, so its area is $(4+10)(4)/2=28$. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected point is in the shaded region (i.e., satisfies $2x + 5y \geq 20$) is $$\frac{\text{area of shaded region }}{\text{area of entire region }} = \frac{28}{10\cdot10} = \boxed{\frac{7}{25}}.$$[asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
We will use the complementary probability, that is, we will find the probability that 5 dice show a 1 and subtract it from 1. The probability that one die shows a 1 is $\frac{1}{6}$ and the probability that it does not show a 1 is $\frac{5}{6}$. Therefore, the probability that all 5 dice show a 1 is $\left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^5$. So the probability that at least one die does not show a 1 is $1 - \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^5$. 

Now, we have to consider the cases where exactly 1, 2, 3, or 4 dice show a 1. Let's start with the case where exactly 1 die shows a 1. There are 5 ways to choose which die shows a 1, and the probability that it shows a 1 is $\frac{1}{6}$, while the probability that the other dice do not show a 1 is $\left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4$. Therefore, the probability that exactly 1 die shows a 1 is $5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4$. 

Similarly, the probability that exactly 2, 3, or 4 dice show a 1 is given by:

- exactly 2: ${5 \choose 2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3$
- exactly 3: ${5 \choose 3} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2$
- exactly 4: ${5 \choose 4} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^4 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^1$

Adding up these probabilities, we get the probability that at most 4 dice show a 1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left( 1 - \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^5 \right) + 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6} \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \\
& \quad + {5 \choose 2} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 + {5 \choose 3} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^2 + {5 \choose 4} \cdot \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^4 \cdot \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^1 \\

Let's try counting the number of perfect squares and cubes less than $441=21^2$. There are twenty perfect squares less than 441: $1^2, 2^2, \ldots, 20^2$. There are also seven perfect cubes less than 441: $1^3, 2^3, \ldots, 7^3$. So there would seem to be $20+7=27$ numbers less than 441 which are either perfect squares and perfect cubes.

But wait! $1=1^2=1^3$ is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, so we've accidentally counted it twice. Similarly, we've counted any sixth power less than 441 twice because any sixth power is both a square and a cube at the same time. Fortunately, the only other such one is $2^6=64$. Thus, there are $27-2=25$ numbers less than 441 that are perfect squares or perfect cubes. Also, since $20^2=400$ and $7^3=343$, then all 25 of these numbers are no more than 400. To compensate for these twenty-five numbers missing from the list, we need to add the next twenty-five numbers: 401, 402, $\ldots$, 424, 425, none of which are perfect square or perfect cubes. Thus, the $400^{\text{th}}$ term is $\boxed{425}$.

The number of squares and cubes from 1 to $n$ is $\left\lfloor\sqrt n\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\sqrt[3] n\right\rfloor - \left\lfloor n^{1/6}\right\rfloor$, by the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. So we just need to find which integer $n$ makes this equal to $399$, yielding the $400^{\text{th}}$ term. We know that the answer is at least $3^6+1=730$, and at most $730^2-1$. We also know it's odd, so we can search for the answer by trying odd numbers. Using some integer arithmetic, it becomes apparent (or with a computer search) that $n=671$ is the correct value, so the answer is $\boxed{671}$.

Thus the sum of the elements of the $k$th row, for $k \le n$, is $2^k$, so the total sum of all the elements of the previous rows is \[\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = \frac{2^n-1}{2-1} = 2^n-1\] by the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Therefore, $f(n)=2^n-(2^n-1)=1$ for all $n \ge 2015$. (That is, it is a constant!) Thus, the minimum value is clearly $\boxed{1}$.

We find the perfect squares from $10$ to $17$ and $19$ to $24$. So the squares lie between $101$ and $289$ inclusive.

The $25$ primes less than $100$ clearly won't work. The ninth prime, which is $23$, gives us $23^2 = 529$, which is too large. By the time we reach the $11$th prime, which is $31$, we have $31^2 = 961$, which is too large again. Hence, we need consider only the first $10$ primes.

Listing out the ten primes in order, from smallest to largest, we have \begin{align*}
2 &\quad (\text{too small}) \\
3 &\quad (= 9) \\
5 &\quad (\text{too small}) \\
7 &\quad (\text{too small}) \\

We want to find the integer factor $x$ such that $9!\cdot x = 11!$. We can rewrite $11!$ as $11\cdot10\cdot9!$, so we have:

\begin{align*}
9!\cdot x &= 11! \\
9!\cdot x &= 11\cdot10\cdot9! \\
x &= 11\cdot10 \\
x &= 110
\end{align*}

Therefore, 9! must be multiplied by 110 to equal 11!.

Solution 1: We choose any seat for Pierre, and then seat everyone else relative to Pierre.  There are 2 choices for Thomas; to the right or left of Pierre.  Then, there are 4 possible seats for Rosa that aren't adjacent to Pierre or Thomas. The five remaining people can be arranged in any of $5!$ ways, so there are a total of $2\cdot 4\cdot 5!=960$ valid ways to arrange the people around the table.

Solution 2: The total number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together is $6! \cdot 2 = 1440$. The number of ways in which Pierre and Thomas sit together and Rosa sits next to one of them is $5! \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 480$. So the answer is the difference $1440 - 480 = \boxed{960}$.

We can use complementary counting. First we count the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:

$$7!$$

Now we count the number of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is allowed to sit next to one of them (but not both):

- We can treat Pierre and Thomas as one person, so there are 7 people in total. We arrange them in a circle, which gives us $6!$ arrangements.
- For each of these arrangements, there are 2 ways to place Pierre and Thomas relative to each other.
- There are 2 ways to choose which of them Rosa will sit next to.
- There are 2 ways to choose which side of that person Rosa will sit.
- For the remaining 4 people, there are $4!$ arrangements.

Therefore, there are $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6! \cdot 4!$ arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is allowed to sit next to one of them.

Now we count the number of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is not allowed to sit next to either of them:

- We can treat Pierre and Thomas as one person, so there are 7 people in total. We arrange them in a circle, which gives us $6!$ arrangements.
- For each of these arrangements, there are 2 ways to place Pierre and Thomas relative to each other.
- There are 4 pairs of adjacent seats, and Rosa cannot sit in any of them. Therefore, there are 4 ways to choose where Rosa will sit.
- For the remaining 4 people, there are $4!$ arrangements.

Therefore, there are $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6! \cdot 4!$ arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is not allowed to sit next to either of them.

The answer is the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is allowed to sit next to one of them, minus the number of arrangements where Pierre and Thomas are together and Rosa is not allowed to sit next to either of them:

$$7! - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 6! \cdot 4! - 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6! \cdot 4! = \boxed{24,\!192}$$

We can approach this problem by breaking it down into cases. 

Case 1: The two math books are on the ends of the stack.
There are 2 ways to choose which math book goes on the left end, and 1 way to choose which math book goes on the right end. Then, we need to arrange the remaining 4 books in the middle of the stack. There are 4! = 24 ways to do this. So in total, there are 2 * 1 * 24 = 48 ways to stack the books in this case. 

Case 2: One of the math books is on the left end, and one is on the right end.
There are 2 ways to choose which math book goes on the left end, and 1 way to choose which math book goes on the right end (since we already used one of the math books). Then, we need to arrange the remaining 4 books in the middle of the stack. There are 4! = 24 ways to do this. So in total, there are 2 * 1 * 24 = 48 ways to stack the books in this case. 

Therefore, the total number of ways to stack the books with a math book on both ends is 48 + 48 = 96.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since 10 is small for a product, we consider the complementary probability, that their product is at most 10. To do this, we count the number of ordered pairs of positive integers $(m,n)$ with $mn\le10$ ($m$ is Krishanu's number and $n$ is Shaunak's number). If $m=1$, there are 10 such pairs; if $m=2$, there are 5; if $m=3$ there are 3; if $m=4$ or $m=5$, there are 2, and if $m=6,7,8,9,10$ there is 1, for a total of $$10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1+1+1=27$$ordered pairs with product at most 10. The probability one of these is picked is then $27/100$, since there are $10\cdot10=100$ possible ordered pairs. Therefore, the probability that the product of their numbers is greater than 10 is $1-27/100=\boxed{\frac{73}{100}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We could use complementary counting here and find the probability that the product of their numbers is 10 or less, and then subtract that from 1. However, it's probably easier to consider the cases where the product is more than 10. These are:

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{10}{3}$.

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{10}{4}$ (i.e. greater than 2.5).

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than 2.

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{5}{3}$.

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 7, 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{10}{7}$ (i.e. greater than about 1.4).

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 8, 9, or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{10}{8}$ (i.e. greater than 1.25).

$\bullet$ Krishanu picks 9 or 10, and Shaunak picks a number greater than $\frac{10}{9}$ (i.e. greater than about 1.11).

We could keep going, but we don't need to because the probabilities get very small for larger numbers. We just need to count how many numbers satisfy each condition and divide by the total number of possible pairs. There are:

$\bullet$ $8 \cdot 7 = 56$ pairs that work for the first condition ($8$ choices for Krishanu and $7$ choices for Shaunak).

$\bullet$ $7 \cdot 6 = 42$ pairs that work for the second condition (we exclude 3 because $\frac{10}{3} \approx 3.3$ is not an integer).

$\bullet$ $6 \cdot 5 = 30$ pairs that work for the third condition.

$\bullet$ $5 \cdot 4 = 20$ pairs that work for the fourth condition.

$\bullet$ $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ pairs that work for the fifth condition (we exclude 1 because $\frac{10}{7} \approx 1.4$ is not an integer).

$\bullet$ $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ pairs that work for the sixth condition.

$\bullet$ $2 \cdot 1 = 2$ pairs that work for the seventh condition.

The total number of possible pairs is $10 \cdot 10 = 100$. So the probability that the product is more than 10 is:

$$\frac{56 + 42 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 6 + 2}{100} = \frac{168}{1000} = \boxed{\frac{21}{125}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The product of the numbers on the five visible faces will be divisible by 6 if and only if we see a 2, a 3, or both.

If we see a 2, then one of the other five faces must show 3 or 6 to get a product divisible by 6.  So, the probability of seeing a 2 and a 3 or 6 is $\frac16 \cdot \frac26 = \frac{1}{18}$.

If we see a 3, then one of the other five faces must show a 2, 4, or 6 to get a product divisible by 6.  So, the probability of seeing a 3 and a 2, 4, or 6 is $\frac16 \cdot \frac36 = \frac{1}{12}$.

If we see both a 2 and a 3, then one of the other four faces must show a 4 or a 6 to get a product divisible by 6.  So, the probability of seeing both a 2 and a 3, and a 4 or 6 among the other four faces, is $\frac16 \cdot \frac26 \cdot \frac24 = \frac{1}{36}$.

The probability of seeing at least a 2 or a 3 is the sum of the probabilities of the above three cases: $\frac{1}{18}+\frac{1}{12}-\frac{1}{36}=\boxed{\frac{5}{36}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are ${8 \choose 2} = 28$ pairs of bills that can be drawn without replacement. If the sum of the two bills is $\$20$ or more, it must be one of the following:

\begin{align*}
20 + 0 &= \$20 \\
20 + 1 &= \$21 \\
20 + 5 &= \$25 \\
20 + 10 &= \$30 \\
20 + 20 &= \$40 \\
10 + 10 &= \$20 \\
10 + 20 &= \$30 \\
5 + 5 &= \$10 \\
5 + 10 &= \$15 \\
1 + 1 &= \$2
\end{align*}

There are ${2 \choose 2} = 1$ ways to pick two $\$20$ bills, ${2 \choose 1}{2 \choose 1} = 4$ ways to pick one $\$20$ bill and one other bill, and ${2 \choose 2}{2 \choose 2}{2 \choose 2} = 1$ way to pick two of each of the other three denominations.

Thus, there are $1+4+1=6$ pairs of bills that add up to $\$20$ or more. Therefore, the probability of drawing a pair of bills that add up to $\$20$ or more is $\boxed{\frac{3}{14}}$.

We will consider this as a composite of two problems with two indistinguishable balls and 3 distinguishable boxes.  For two indistinguishable green balls, we can place the balls in a box together or in separate boxes.  There are $3$ options to arrange them together (in box 1, 2, or 3) and $3$ options for placing them separately (nothing in box 1, 2, or 3).  So there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable green balls.  By the same reasoning, there are 6 ways to arrange the indistinguishable red balls, for a total of $6 \times 6 = \boxed{36}$ arrangements of the 4 balls.

Without loss of generality, let the boxes be labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. We will use a stars and bars argument.

First we ignore the fact that the balls are indistinguishable. We need to place 4 balls in 3 boxes, which is equivalent to placing 2 dividers among 4 balls. There are ${4+2 \choose 2} = 15$ ways to do this.

However, in each of these arrangements, the two green balls are indistinguishable from each other, and the two red balls are indistinguishable from each other. Therefore, we need to divide each arrangement by 2! twice (once for the green balls, once for the red balls). This gives us $\dfrac{15}{2 \cdot 2} = \boxed{1}$ way to distribute the balls.

Because 17 is between $5\times3=15$ and $6\times 3 = 18$, we know that $\dfrac{17}{3}$ is somewhere between $5$ and $6$. Since $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2=\dfrac{17^2}{3^2}=\dfrac{289}{9}$, we see that 289 is between $32\times9=288$ and $33\times9=297$ and thus that $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ is between 32 and 33. Therefore, the integers from 6 to 32, inclusive, lie between $\dfrac{17}{3}$ and $\left(\dfrac{17}{3}\right)^2$ on the number line, for a total of $32-6+1=\boxed{27}$ integers.

Not considering rotations and reflections, there are 8 ways to choose the first bead to put on the necklace, followed by 7, 6, 5, and 4 ways to choose the next beads. For each arrangements of beads on the necklace, there are 5 ways to rotate it and another 5 ways to reflect it and then rotate it to another arrangement. Thus, arrangements of beads on the necklace come in groups of 10 equivalent arrangements. The total number of different arrangements is therefore $8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5\cdot4/10=\boxed{672}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/488_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We have a few cases to consider:

1. All five beads are distinct: There are $8\times 7\times 6\times 5\times 4=6,\!720$ ways to choose five distinct beads, but each arrangement can be rotated in five ways and reflected in two ways, so there are $6,\!720/(5\times 2)=672$ distinct necklaces.
2. Four of the beads are the same, and the fifth is distinct: There are $8$ ways to choose the distinct bead and ${8\choose 1}=8$ ways to choose which of the other seven beads is duplicated four times. The arrangement is uniquely determined once we choose which position is occupied by the distinct bead, so there are $8\times 5=40$ distinct necklaces.
3. Three of the beads are the same, and the other two are distinct: There are ${8\choose 2}=28$ ways to choose the two distinct beads, ${8\choose 1}=8$ ways to choose which of the other seven beads is the repeated one, and $\frac{5!}{3!2!}=10$ ways to order the five beads. Thus, there are $28\times 8\times 10=2,\!240$ distinct necklaces.
4. Two of the beads are the same, and the other three are distinct: There are ${8\choose 2}=28$ ways to choose the two beads that are the same, ${6\choose 3}=20$ ways to choose the three distinct beads, and $\frac{5!}{2!2!1!}=30$ ways to order the five beads (the denominator in the permutation counts the ways to rearrange the repeated bead and the ways to rearrange the three distinct beads). Thus, there are $28\times 20\times 30=16,\!800$ distinct necklaces.
5. All five beads are the same: There is only one necklace in this case.

In total, there are $672+40+2,\!240+16,\!800+1=\boxed{19,\!753}$ distinct necklaces.

A number is a perfect square and a perfect cube if and only if it is a perfect sixth power.  Note that $10^2 = 100$ and $4^3<100<5^3$, while $2^6 < 100 < 3^6 = 9^3$.  Hence, there are 10 squares and 4 cubes between 1 and 100, inclusive.  However, there are also 2 sixth powers, so when we add $10 + 4$ to count the number of squares and cubes, we count these sixth powers twice.  However, we don't want to count these sixth powers at all, so we must subtract them twice.  This gives us a total of $10 + 4 - 2\cdot 2 = 10$ different numbers that are perfect squares or perfect cubes, but not both.  Thus, our probability is $\frac{10}{100} = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

We can break this problem down into cases based on the number of groups we form:

Case 1: One group
There's only one way to form one group - we put all four oranges in that group.

Case 2: Two groups
We can split the four oranges into a group of 1 and a group of 3, or a group of 2 and a group of 2. There are ${4 \choose 1} = 4$ ways to choose one orange for the first group, and ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ ways to choose two oranges for the second group. Alternatively, there are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose two oranges for the first group, which uniquely determines the other two oranges that go in the second group. So there are $4 \cdot 3 + 6 = 18$ ways to divide the oranges into two groups.

Case 3: Three groups
We can split the four oranges into a group of 1, a group of 1, and a group of 2, or a group of 1, a group of 2, and a group of 1, or a group of 2, a group of 1, and a group of 1. There are ${4 \choose 1} = 4$ ways to choose one orange for the first group, then ${3 \choose 1} = 3$ ways to choose one orange for the second group from the remaining three oranges, leaving the last two oranges for the third group. So there are $4 \cdot 3 = 12$ ways to divide the oranges into three groups.

In total, there are $1+18+12 = \boxed{31}$ ways to divide the oranges into at most three groups.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to choose 3 Republicans out of the 55 available and 2 Democrats out of the 45 available. The order in which we choose them does not matter. This is a combination problem, so we use the formula:

$${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$

where $n$ is the total number of items, $k$ is the number of items we want to choose, and ${n \choose k}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from $n$.

Using this formula, we have:

$${55 \choose 3}{45 \choose 2} = \frac{55!}{3!52!}\cdot\frac{45!}{2!43!}$$
$$= \frac{55 \cdot 54 \cdot 53}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} \cdot \frac{45 \cdot 44}{2 \cdot 1}$$
$$= 22,957,500$$

Therefore, there are 22,957,500 ways to choose a 5-person committee consisting of 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats from the Senate.

The prime numbers from 1 to 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on any one die is equal to $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$, since there is an equal probability of rolling any number from 1 to 6. Since the two dice are independent, the probability of Adam not rolling a prime number on either die is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

The only non-prime numbers a die can land on are 1, 4, and 6.  Since there are two dice in each roll, and each die has 3 undesirable outcomes, there are $3\cdot3=9$ unlucky outcomes when he rolls two dice.  The total number of possible outcomes is $6\cdot6=36$.  Thus, the probability that he did not roll a prime number is $(36-9)/36 =\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}.$

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/497_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let $a$ be the first digit, $b$ be the second digit, and $c$ be the last digit. We are looking for the number of solutions to $a+b=c$. Since $a$ can be any digit between $1$ and $9$, $b$ can be any digit between $0$ and $9$, and $c$ can be any digit between $0$ and $18$, we have a total of $9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19$ possible cases to consider. However, not all of these cases are valid. Any combination of $a$ and $b$ that adds up to more than $9$ isn't valid since $c$ is a digit between $0$ and $9$. Thus, we need to eliminate any cases where $a+b$ is greater than $9$. 

There are a few ways to count the number of valid cases. One approach is to use casework on the value of $a$:

If $a=1$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $8$, for a total of $9$ choices.
If $a=2$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $7$, for a total of $8$ choices.
If $a=3$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $6$, for a total of $7$ choices.
If $a=4$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $5$, for a total of $6$ choices.
If $a=5$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $4$, for a total of $5$ choices.
If $a=6$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $3$, for a total of $4$ choices.
If $a=7$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $2$, for a total of $3$ choices.
If $a=8$, then $b$ can be any digit from $0$ to $1$, for a total of $2$ choices.
If $a=9$, then $b$ can only equal $0$, for a total of $1$ choice.

Thus, the total number of valid cases is $9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1=45$. For each choice of $a$ and $b$, there is exactly one valid choice for $c$, namely $c=a+b$. Therefore, there are a total of $45$ valid $4$-digit numbers. 

Note that another way to count the number of valid cases is to use a stars-and-bars argument. We want to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $a+b+c=d$, where $a$ is a one-digit number, $b$ is a one-digit or zero-digit number, and $c$ is a one-digit number, and $d$ is a four-digit number. To do this, we can replace $a$ with $a'=a-1$, so that $a'$ is a zero-digit number, and then use stars and bars to count the number of solutions to $a'+b+c=d-1$. The number of solutions is $\binom{d-1}{2}$, and the sum of this over all possible values of $d$ between $1000$ and $9999$ inclusive is $45$.

Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{21}(1) + \frac{2}{21}(2) + \cdots + \frac{6}{21}(6) = \frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots 6^2}{21} = \boxed{\frac{13}{3}}. \]

Extracting Answer from: 
There are three possibilities for the number of lamps on each table: $0$, $1$, or $2$. We use casework on this number.

If there are $0$ lamps on one of the tables, then the other two tables must have all $10$ lamps. There is only $1$ way to distribute the lamps in this case.

If there is $1$ lamp on one of the tables, then this table has to have only $1$ lamp, and the other two tables have to have the remaining $9$ lamps. There are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose which table gets the lone lamp, and only $1$ way to distribute the rest of the lamps. So there are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways in this case.

If there are $2$ lamps on one of the tables, then this table must have exactly $2$ lamps, and the other two tables must have the remaining $8$ lamps. There are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose which table gets the two lamps, and $\binom{10}{2}$ ways to distribute the lamps on this table. The remaining $8$ lamps can be distributed in only $1$ way on the other two tables. So there are $\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{10}{2}$ ways in this case.

Summing over all cases, we get the total number of ways as $$1 + \binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{10}{2} = \boxed{466}.$$

The only way for the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose to be odd is if one of them chooses 2 and the other chooses an odd prime. There are five ways for Paul to choose 2 and Jesse to choose an odd prime, and there are five ways for Jesse to choose 2 and Paul to choose an odd prime. Since there are $6\cdot 6=36$ total possible ways for Paul and Jesse to choose their numbers, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is NOT even is $\frac{10}{36}=\frac{5}{18}$.

There are only two possibilities for the parity (even or odd) of the sum of two primes: either both primes are odd and their sum is even, or one prime is odd and one is even, in which case their sum is odd. Therefore, the sum of two primes can only be even if both primes are odd.

There are three odd primes among the first six primes: 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd prime is $\left(\frac{3}{6}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = \frac{1}{5}$.

Of these, $\binom{9}{5}$ include no heavy metal CDs, $\binom{8}{5}$ include no rap CDs, and $\binom{7}{5}$ include no country CDs.  We can add these numbers to find the number of sets of CDs which do not include at least one CD from each category, except that we have counted the set of 5 country CDs twice, since it omits both heavy metal and rap.

There are a total of $\binom{12}{5} = 792$ possible selections of 5 CDs from the 12 available.

To determine the number of selections that include at least one CD from each category, we can consider the cases where Carlos selects 1 CD from each category and then chooses the remaining 2 CDs in any way. The number of selections with 1 CD from each category is $4 \cdot 5 \cdot 3 = 60$ (4 choices for the rap CD, 5 choices for the country CD, and 3 choices for the heavy metal CD). After Carlos selects one CD of each category, there are 9 CDs left to choose from, so there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to choose the remaining 2 CDs.

Therefore, the probability that Carlos selects at least one CD from each category is $$

We can choose two numbers in $\binom{99}{2}=4851$ ways. Two numbers will have a product which is a multiple of 3 if at least one of them is a multiple of 3. We can more easily count the number of ways for the product to not be a multiple of 3: this happens when neither of the numbers is a multiple of 3. There are $\frac{99}{3}=33$ multiples of 3 less than 100, and $99-33=66$ numbers which aren't multiples of 3. The number of ways to choose two of these numbers is $\binom{66}{2}=2145$, so the number of way to choose two numbers where at least one is a multiple of 3 is $4851-2145=2706$.

The only way that the product will not be a multiple of 3 is if neither of the integers is a multiple of 3. There are 33 multiples of 3 between 1 and 99 (inclusive), so there are 66 positive integers that are not a multiple of 3. Therefore, there are $\binom{66}{2}=2145$ pairs of numbers that are not a multiple of 3. 

There are 32 multiples of 3 that are less than 100, so there are 67 positive integers less than 100 that are a multiple of 3. Therefore, there are $\binom{67}{2}=2211$ pairs of numbers that are a multiple of 3. 

The total number of pairs of positive integers less than 100 is $\binom{99}{2}=4851$. 

Therefore, the probability that the resulting product is a multiple of 3 is $$1-\dfrac{2145}{4851}=\dfrac{2706}{4851}=\boxed{\dfrac{902}{1617}}.$$

There are two paths from A to B: A to K to B, and A to J to B.  The probability that a log will go from A to K to B is the probability that it will choose the middle flume initially times the probability that it will choose the flume to the right given that it chose the middle flume initially: $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{6}$.  Similarly, the probability that the log will go from A to J to B is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)=\frac{1}{9}$.

There is a $1/2$ chance that the log will leave $A$ and enter $B$ through the top flume.  If the log instead leaves to the left (or right) of that flume, there is a $1/2$ chance it will enter $B$ (due to the symmetry of the pond); this happens with probability $1/2 \cdot 1/2 = 1/4$.  Lastly, if the log leaves $A$ through the bottom-right flume, then there is a $2/3$ chance it will end in pond $C$ rather than pond $B$, since there are two ways to go right and one way to go left.  The final probability that the log finds its way to pond $B$ is hence: $$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \boxed{\frac{5}{12}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
After Pierre sits, we can place Rosa either two seats from Pierre (that is, with one seat between them) or three seats from Pierre. We tackle these two cases separately:

Case 1: Rosa is two seats from Pierre. There are $2$ such seats. For either of these, there are then four empty seats in a row, and one empty seat between Rosa and Pierre. Thomas can sit in either of the middle two of the four empty seats in a row. So, there are $2\cdot 2 = 4$ ways to seat Rosa and Thomas in this case. There are then $4$ seats left, which the others can take in $4! = 24$ ways. So, there are $4\cdot 24 = 96$ seatings in this case.

Case 2: Rosa is three seats from Pierre (that is, there are $2$ seats between them). There are $2$ such seats. Thomas can't sit in either of the $2$ seats directly between them, but after Rosa sits, there are $3$ empty seats in a row still, and Thomas can only sit in the middle seat of these three. Once again, there are $4$ empty seats remaining, and the $4$ remaining people can sit in them in $4! = 24$ ways. So, we have $2\cdot 24 = 48$ seatings in this case.

Putting our two cases together gives a total of $96+48 = \boxed{144}$ seatings.

We now need to remove the arrangements that are not allowed. We can do this with a counting argument. We first seat the three people we don't want sitting next to each other. We then seat the remaining $4$ people into the $4$ spots between them.
We must seat the three people we don't want sitting next to each other. They must sit in every other chair around the table, of which there are three. This can be done in $3!$ ways. We can it seat the remaining $4$ people in the remaining $4$ spots. This can be done in $4!$ ways.

Every positive integer appears at least once; if we consider an arbitrary integer $k$, it can be written in the form $\binom{k}{1}$. Almost all integers can be written twice, because $\binom{k}{1} = \binom{k}{k-1} = k$, but when $k-1 = 1$, the two occurrences overlap into one. This takes place for $k = 2$, and $2$ only appears once in Pascal's Triangle, because succeeding rows of Pascal's Triangle only contain $1$'s and numbers greater than $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In Pascal's Triangle, the number of times a positive integer $n$ appears is the same as the number of positive integers $k$ such that $\binom{k}{j} = n$ for some positive integer $j$. This occurs if and only if $k$ can be written in the form $k = a+b$ and $n = \binom{a+b}{a}$ for some nonnegative integers $a,b$, since $\binom{k}{j} = \binom{a+b}{j+b}$.

Let $n$ be a positive integer. Then $n = \binom{a+b}{a} = \dfrac{(a+b)!}{a!b!}$ for some nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. Rearranging, we have \[a!b! = \dfrac{(a+b)!}{n}\] and \[(a!)^2 \mid a!b!.\] It follows that $a! \mid b!$. Let $b = ra$ for some nonnegative integer $r$; then we have \[a! (ra)! = \dfrac{(ra + 1)(ra+2) \cdots (ra+a)}{n}.\] In particular, $n \mid (ra+a)(ra+a-1)\cdots(ra+1)$.

Suppose $n$ is prime. Let $p$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$. Then $p \mid n \mid (ra+a)(ra+a-1)\cdots(ra+1)$, so by the minimality of $p$, we have $p \mid ra+i$ for some $i$ satisfying $1 \le i \le a$. But \[\gcd(i,a!) = \gcd(i-1,a!) = \dotsb = \gcd(1,a!) = 1,\] so $p \nmid a!$ and hence $p \mid r$. But this implies $p \mid n/(ra)$, which contradicts the mininimality of $p$. Therefore, $n$ cannot be prime.

For $n = 1,2$, we have $f(n) = n$. Now suppose $n$ is composite and is neither $1$ nor $2$. Let $n = pq$ for some positive integers $p > 1$ and $q > 1$. Note that \begin{align*}
f(n) &\le f(p) + f(q) \quad \left(\text{since }\binom{k}{j} = 0\text{ if }k < j\right)\\
&\le (p-1) + (q-1) \quad \left(\text{since }p\text{ and }q\text{ appear exactly once in the first row}\right)\\
&= p+q-2\\
&< pq - 1 = n-1.
\end{align*} Therefore, we see that $f(n) > n-1$ for all composite $n$ that are neither $1$ nor $2$. Therefore, the minimum value of $f(n)$ is $\boxed{1}$, which occurs only for $n = 1$ or $n = 2$.

We can solve this problem using casework. There are two cases to consider: either the cook selects exactly 4 green peppers, or he selects all 5 green peppers.

Case 1: Selecting exactly 4 green peppers.

To select exactly 4 green peppers, the cook must also select 2 red peppers. There are $\binom{5}{4}$ ways to select 4 green peppers out of 5, and $\binom{10}{2}$ ways to select 2 red peppers out of 10. Therefore, there are $\binom{5}{4} \cdot \binom{10}{2}$ ways to select exactly 4 green peppers and 2 red peppers.

Case 2: Selecting all 5 green peppers.

To select all 5 green peppers, the cook must also select 1 red pepper. There are $\binom{5}{5}$ ways to select all 5 green peppers, and $\binom{10}{1}$ ways to select 1 red pepper. Therefore, there are $\binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{1}$ ways to select all 5 green peppers and 1 red pepper.

In total, there are $\binom{15}{6}$ ways to select 6 peppers out of the 15 available. Therefore, the probability of selecting at least 4 green peppers is:

$$\frac{\binom{5}{4} \cdot \binom{10}{2} + \binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{10}{1}}{\binom{15}{6}} = \frac{525}{5005} = \boxed{\frac{21}{143}}.$$

We can use the combination formula to solve this problem. We want to choose 2 teachers out of 5, 3 parents out of 7, and 3 students out of 6. 

The number of ways to choose 2 teachers out of 5 is: 

$${5 \choose 2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = 10$$

The number of ways to choose 3 parents out of 7 is: 

$${7 \choose 3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35$$

The number of ways to choose 3 students out of 6 is: 

$${6 \choose 3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20$$

To find the total number of subcommittees, we need to multiply these three numbers together: 

$$10\times 35 \times 20 = 7,\!000$$

Therefore, there are 7,000 different subcommittees that can be formed.

The smallest possible sum is $1+1+1=3$, so it is impossible for the sum to be less than 3.  The largest sum is $6+6+6=18$, so there are $18-3+1=16$ possible sums.  Since each of the three dice is equally likely to show any number from 1 to 6, there are $6^3=216$ possible outcomes.  Therefore, the probability of rolling a sum less than 3 is $0$, and the probability of rolling a sum of 3 or more is $1-\frac{0}{216}=\boxed{100\%}$.

We know that the number of subsets of any given set is equal to $2^n,$ where $n$ is the number of elements in the set. First, then, we need to find the number of composite divisors. The prime factorization of $72$ is $72=2^3 \cdot 3^2,$ so there are $(3+1)(2+1)=12$ total divisors. (To see this, note that we can form a divisor of the form $2^a 3^b$ by freely choosing $a=0,1,2,3$ and $b=0,1,2$). Of these, $1$ is neither prime nor composite, and $2$ and $3$ are prime, for a total of $9$ composite divisors. Therefore there are $2^9=\boxed{512}$ subsets of the divisors of $72$ with only composite divisors.

Extracting Answer from: 
Prime factorize $72$ as $2^3 \cdot 3^2$. To generate a subset containing only composite numbers, we must either include some combination of $4$, $6$, $8$, or $9$, or we may exclude a prime factor. We may exclude $2, 3,$ or both $2$ and $3$.

The total number of divisors of $72$ is $(3+1)(2+1) = 12$, so there are $2^{12}$ subsets of the set of divisors of $72$.

There are $2^2$ sets containing only $2^2$ and $2^3$.
There are $2^1$ sets containing only $2^2$ and $2^3 \cdot 3$.

There are $2^1$ sets containing only $2^3 \cdot 3$ and $3^2 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3$.

There are also $2^1$ sets that exclude the factor of $3$, since for each divisor with a factor of $3$, we have two choices: include it or exclude it.

Thus, the total number of subsets containing only composite numbers is $$2^2 + 9 \cdot 2^1 + 2^1 = \boxed{22}.$$

By the order of operations, we must perform the multiplication and division first, and then perform the addition. Thus, we get $$8+4 \times 6\div 2 = 8+24\div 2 = 8+12 = 20.$$To get a different value, we can put parentheses in different places. For example, we may put them around $8+4$ to get $$ (8+4)\times 6\div 2=144\div 2=72.$$We may also put them around $4 \times 6$ to get $$8+4\times (6\div 2)=8+4 \times 3 = 20.$$It is impossible to obtain any other values, since any other way of grouping the terms will give the same result as one of the above expressions, up to the order of operations. Thus, only $\boxed{3}$ distinct values are possible.

Extracting Answer from: 
To get an odd product, we must roll an odd number on at least one of the dice. There are 3 odd numbers on a die, so the probability of rolling an odd number on one die is $\dfrac{3}{6}=\dfrac{1}{2}$. Hence, the probability of rolling an odd number on both dice is $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)=\dfrac{1}{4}$. We multiply this by the probability of the other die rolling any number (even or odd) that is not a multiple of 3, which is $\dfrac{4}{6} = \dfrac{2}{3}$. Hence, the probability of rolling an odd number on both dice and a number that is not a multiple of 3 on the other die is $\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)=\dfrac{1}{6}$.

To get a product that is a multiple of 3, we must have at least one 3 among the numbers on the two dice. There are two ways this can happen: either we roll a 3 on one die and any multiple of 3 (3 or 6) on the other die, or we roll a multiple of 3 (3 or 6) on both dice. The probability of rolling a 3 on one die and any multiple of 3 on the other die is $\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)\left(\dfrac{2}{6}\right)=\dfrac{1}{18}$. The probability of rolling a multiple of 3 on both dice is $\left(\dfrac{2}{6}\right)\left(\dfrac{2}{6}\right)=\dfrac{1}{9}$. Hence, the probability of rolling a product that is a multiple of 3 is $\dfrac{1}{18}+\dfrac{1}{9}=\dfrac{1}{6}$.

Finally, the probability of Jean winning is the sum of the probabilities of rolling an odd product and a product that is a multiple of 3: $\dfrac{1}{6}+\dfrac{1}{6}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We break this up into cases based on the number of heads flipped among the $3+4=7$ coin flips. There are eight possible numbers of heads: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We first note that the number of heads flipped for $A$ and $B$ must either both be even or both be odd in order for there to be a possibility that the numbers are the same. Therefore, we only need to consider the even and odd cases separately.

In the even case, there are 4 possible ways to have an even number of heads: $0+4$, $2+2$, $4+0$, and $1+3$. For each case, we compute the probability of getting that number of heads for $A$ and $B$ and multiply them together. For example, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ get 2 heads is $\frac{3}{8} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{3}{8} \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{9}{64}$ (where we use the formula for the binomial distribution). Therefore, the probability of getting the same number of heads for $A$ and $B$ in the even case is:

$$ P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{9}{64} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{16}\right) = \frac{13}{32} $$

In the odd case, there are 4 possible ways to have an odd number of heads: $1+3$, $3+1$, $2+5$, and $5+2$. For each case, we compute the probability of getting that number of heads for $A$ and $B$ and multiply them together. For example, the probability that both $A$ and $B$ get 3 heads is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \binom{3}{3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot \binom{4}{0} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{16}$ (where we use the formula for the binomial distribution). Therefore, the probability of getting the same number of heads for $A$ and $B$ in the odd case is:

$$ P(\text{odd}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{15}{32} + \frac{15}{32}\right) = \frac{31}{64} $$

Finally, we add the two probabilities to get the overall probability:

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/56_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
First we count the number of ways to arrange the letters without any restrictions. There are a total of 11 letters, but there are repeats: 4 S's, 4 I's, and 2 P's. So the number of ways to arrange them is:

$$\frac{11!}{4!4!2!} = 34,\!650$$

However, we have overcounted because some of these arrangements have the same letters in different positions. Specifically, we need to account for the fact that:

- There are 4 S's that can be arranged among themselves in $4!$ ways, but these arrangements are indistinguishable from each other. So we counted each group of 4 arrangements as $4!$ different arrangements.
- Similarly, there are 4 I's that can be arranged among themselves in $4!$ ways, but we counted each group of 4 arrangements as $4!$ different arrangements.
- There are 2 P's that can be arranged among themselves in $2!$ ways, but we counted each group of 2 arrangements as $2!$ different arrangements.

Therefore, we need to divide our initial count by:

$$4! \cdot 4! \cdot 2! = 1,\!152$$

to get the final answer:

$$\frac{11!}{4!4!2! \cdot 4! \cdot 4! \cdot 2!} = \frac{34,\!650}{1,\!152} = \boxed{30}.$$

We need to use casework. Suppose first that bag A is chosen: there is a $1/2$ chance of this occurring. There are ${5 \choose 2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10$ total ways to select two balls from bag A. If the two balls are the same color, then they must be either both white or both red. If both are white, then there are ${3\choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick the two white balls, and if both are red, then there is $1$ way to pick the two red balls. Thus, the probability of selecting two balls of the same color from bag A is $\frac{1+3}{10} = \frac{2}{5}$.

Next, suppose that bag B is chosen, again with $1/2$ chance. There are ${9 \choose 2} = \frac{9 \cdot 8}{2} = 36$ ways to pick the two balls. There are ${6 \choose 2} = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{2} = 15$ ways to pick two white balls, and ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ ways to pick two red balls. Thus, the probability that two balls drawn from bag B are the same color is equal to $\frac{15+3}{36} = \frac 12$.

Thus, the probability that the balls have the same color is $\frac 12 \cdot \frac 25 + \frac 12 \cdot \frac 12 = \boxed{\frac 9{20}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by computing the probability that bag A is chosen to do this we compute $P(A)$, the probability that Bag A is selected (and therefore Bag B is not). This probability is just $\frac{1}{2}$.

Next, we want to compute the probability that two balls drawn from Bag A are the same color: $$\begin{aligned} P(\text{same color } \mid \text{ Bag A selected}) &= P(\text{two white} \mid \text{ Bag A selected}) + P(\text{two red} \mid \text{ Bag A selected}) \\ &= \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{7}{20}. \end{aligned}$$The first term comes from the probability that the first ball drawn is white times the probability that the second ball is white given that the first was, and similarly for the second term.

Similarly, we can compute the probability that two balls drawn from Bag $B$ are the same color. This is $$\begin{aligned} P(\text{same color } \mid \text{ Bag B selected}) &= P(\text{two white} \mid \text{ Bag B selected}) + P(\text{two red} \mid \text{ Bag B selected}) \\ &= \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{5}{8} + \frac{3}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{8} = \frac{19}{36}. \end{aligned}$$

Finally, we can obtain the answer we seek by summing these probabilities, weighted by the probability that the corresponding bag was chosen: $$\begin{aligned} P(\text{drawn balls are same color}) &= P(\text{same color } \mid \text{ Bag A selected}) \cdot P(\text{Bag A selected}) + P(\text{same color } \mid \text{ Bag B selected}) \cdot P(\text{Bag B selected}) \\ &= \frac{7}{20} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{19}{36} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{329}{720}}. \end{aligned}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We could try listing out all the possible outcomes and counting the ones that satisfy the condition, but that would be very time-consuming. Instead, we can use the complement (or "opposite") of the desired event to simplify the problem.

The complement of "exactly two of the dice show a 1 or a 2" is "either none or one of the dice shows a 1 or a 2, or three or more of the dice show a 1 or a 2." Let's calculate the probabilities of these two events separately.

First, the probability that none or one of the dice shows a 1 or a 2. For each die, there are 4 out of 6 possible outcomes that are NOT a 1 or a 2. So the probability that a single die does not show a 1 or a 2 is 4/6 = 2/3. Therefore, the probability that five dice do not show a 1 or a 2 is (2/3)^5, and the probability that exactly one die shows a 1 or a 2 is 5*(2/3)^4*(1/3) (the factor of 5 is for choosing which of the five dice is the one that shows a 1 or a 2). Therefore, the probability that none or one of the dice shows a 1 or a 2 is:

(2/3)^5 + 5*(2/3)^4*(1/3) ≈ 0.48148

Next, the probability that three or more of the dice show a 1 or a 2. We can use the complement again: this event is the same as "less than three of the dice show a 1 or a 2." We already calculated the probability of "none or one of the dice" showing a 1 or a 2, so the probability of "exactly two of the dice" showing a 1 or a 2 is:

1 - 0.48148 = 0.51852

Therefore, the probability that exactly two of the five dice show a 1 or a 2 is approximately $\boxed{0.51852}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first find the probability that the ace of spades is the first card flipped. This is simply $\frac{1}{52}$. 

If the ace of spades is not the first card flipped, Carson must flip over one or more face cards before flipping the ace of spades. Let's consider the case where Carson flips over exactly one face card before the ace of spades.

There are 12 face cards in the deck, and 3 of them are the ace of spades. Thus, the probability that the first flipped face card is not the ace of spades is $\frac{9}{13}$ (since there are 9 face cards that are not the ace of spades out of a total of 13 cards). The probability that the next card flipped is the ace of spades is $\frac{3}{39}$ (since there are now 3 ace of spades out of a remaining total of 39 cards). Thus, the probability of flipping over one face card and then the ace of spades is $\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{3}{39}$.

Now, let's consider the case where Carson flips over exactly two face cards before the ace of spades. In this case, the probability of the first two cards being face cards and the third card being the ace of spades is:

$$\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{3}{38}$$

We can continue this process for flipping over 3, 4, 5, and 6 face cards before the ace of spades. The probabilities for each of these cases are:

$$\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{3}{36}$$

$$\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{3}{34}$$

$$\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{7}{33} \cdot \frac{3}{32}$$

$$\frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{7}{33} \cdot \frac{8}{31} \cdot \frac{3}{30}$$

Thus, the total probability of flipping over the ace of spades before any face card is:

$$\frac{1}{52} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{3}{39} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{3}{38} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{3}{36} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{3}{34} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{7}{33} \cdot \frac{3}{32} + \frac{9}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{12} \cdot \frac{5}{37} \cdot \frac{6}{35} \cdot \frac{7}{33} \cdot \frac{8}{31} \cdot \frac{3}{30}$$

This simplifies to:

$$\frac{2421}{2704} \approx 0.8947$$

Therefore, the probability that Carson flips over the ace of spades before any face card is approximately $\boxed{0.8947}$.

With no restriction, the president can be any of the $25$ members, the secretary can be any of the $25$ remaining members, and the treasurer can be any of the remaining $25$ members.

If the same member holds all three offices, it could be any of the $25$ members, so there are $25$ ways for this to happen. We must exclude these $25$ possibilities, so the answer is $25\times 25\times 25-25=\boxed{15,600}.$

There are $3$ people to choose to fill the $3$ offices.  Since it is allowable for a single person to hold $2$ offices, there are $25$ options for the first person, $24$ options for the second person (since we cannot pick the same person again), and $23$ options for the third person.  However, there are $3!$ ways to order the three people who will hold the offices, so we must divide the total by $3!$.

Finally, we subtract the number of invalid configurations, which entail only one or no offices filled.  There are $25$ ways for each person to be the sole person holding an office, and $3$ ways to leave all offices unfilled.  So, in total we have \begin{align*}
\frac{25\cdot 24\cdot 23}{3!}-25\cdot 3 &= 5775-375 \\

Extracting Answer from: 
We first handle the restrictions.  Since Anna and Betty won't take the goldfish, and we don't care what Billy, Eleanor, or Fido want, there are $5!=120$ ways to give the children animals, ignoring whether the animals will be wanted or not.  Now, we get rid of the unwanted goldfish by simply "forcing" Anna to take the goldfish.  Anna can still choose which of the remaining $6$ animals she wants, but we'll multiply everything by $6$ at the end.  Similarly, let Charlie and Danny take the Siamese and Persian, respectively.  We're left with four children who will each get a unique pet.  We can simply list out the remaining animals or do some more work.  Say Billy takes the Poodle.  We can then count the number of ways to give the last three animals to the remaining three children, giving a total of $3\cdot2\cdot1=6$ ways.  The remaining cases are when Billy takes the Golden Retriever, which gives another 6 ways, and Billy takes either the Calico or Minx.  Say Billy takes the Calico.  Then Eleanor has a choice between two animals (one of the two dogs and the remaining cat) and the last two remaining children each have a unique pet forced upon them.  Hence, a total of $2\cdot3=6$ ways.  We have a total of $(5!\cdot6)\cdot2+5!\cdot6=103,680$ ways to give the children pets they'll want.  (Note that we multiply by $6$ at the end since we forced Anna to take the goldfish, gave Charlie the Siamese and Danny the Persian, and we still have to make sure Anna, Billy, Eleanor, and Fido get unique pets.)  Our answer is $\boxed{103,680}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
A number $n$ is a perfect cube if and only if the exponent of every prime in the factorization of $n$ is a multiple of $3$.  The integers not cubes are those having at least one prime factor whose exponent is not a multiple of $3$.

For $n$ to have a prime factor $2^k$ whose exponent is not a multiple of $3$, the maximal such $k$ is $k=7$, giving a greatest factor of $2$ of $128$.
Similarly, the only prime factors of $n$ that could make it not a perfect cube are those less than or equal to $11$: $2,3,5,7,11$.  The greatest power of $3$ less than $250$ is $3^5=243$, and the sparseness of prime cuberoots indicates that we really only need to check $2^r$ times $3^s$ times $p$, where $r=0$ or $1$ and $s$ runs through $0,1,2,3$.

{\bf Case 1:} The prime factor of $n$ is $2$. Then $3\leq n/2\leq 125$, and there are $62$ of these that are not perfect cubes because their maximum factor of $2$ is less than or equal to $2^6=64$.

{\bf Case 2:} The prime factor of $n$ is $3$. Then $2\leq n/3\leq 83.\overline{3}$, and there are $27$ of these that are not perfect cubes because their maximum factor of $3$ is less than or equal to $3^2=9$.

{\bf Case 3:} The prime factor of $n$ is $5$. Then $2\leq n/5\leq 50$, and there are $10$ of these that are not perfect cubes because their maximum factor of $5$ is less than or equal to $5^1=5$.

{\bf Case 4:} The prime factor of $n$ is $7$.  All of these integers have prime factors greater than $7$, so none of them are perfect cubes.

{\bf Case 5:} The prime factor of $n$ is $11$.  All of these integers have prime factors greater than $11$, so none of them are perfect cubes.

There are $62+27+10=\boxed{99}$ integers in this list that are not perfect cubes.

Extracting Answer from: 
For $ab + c$ to be even, either $c$ is even while $ab$ is even (case E1) or $c$ is odd and $ab$ is odd (case E2). We treat these cases separately, though the fact that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are chosen with replacement means that the cases become simpler having noted that $\{ a, b\}$ and $\{ b, a \}$ work (and are counted separately).

Case E1: $ab$ is even (and $c$ is even).
Then $a$ and $b$ must both be even or both be odd. The probability both are even is $(2/5)^2=4/25$, the probability both are odd is $(3/5)^2=9/25$, for a total of $4/25+9/25=13/25$.

Case E2: $ab$ is odd (and $c$ is odd).
Then $a$ and $b$ must take opposite parity. There are $2\cdot3=6$ ways to choose $\{a,b\}$ that work: one of the numbers may be $1$, and both evens are possible, with either odd completing the pair. The probability $ab$ is odd is $4/5\cdot4/5+1/5\cdot1/5=17/25$, so the probability $ab$ is odd and $c$ is even is $6\cdot17/25\cdot2/5=204/625$.

Combining the cases and adding for the various values of $c$, the answer is $$\frac{13}{25}\cdot\frac{1}{2}+\frac{204}{625}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\boxed{\frac{107}{250}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We could proceed by listing all the palindromes: 11111, 11211, 11911, 12121, etc. but that would be tedious.  Instead, observe that the first two and last two digits uniquely determine the entire number.  (For example, if the first two digits are 1 and 9, the last two digits must also be 1 and 9 to form a palindrome with these two digits at the ends.)

Since we have three choices for each of the first two digits and three choices for each of the last two digits, there are $3^2\cdot 3^2 = 81$ possible combinations.  However, we must subtract out the 9 palindromes of the form $x99x$ (where $x$ represents either of the digits 1 or 2), since these have already been counted as palindromes with first and last digits being 9.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can find the total number of ways to answer the test and subtract the number of ways to answer the test with at most $2$ falses. There are $2^{10}$ ways to answer the test because there are $2$ choices (true/false) for each of the $10$ questions. To count the number of ways to answer the test with at most $2$ falses, we use complementary counting.

There are $\binom{10}{2}$ ways to choose the $2$ questions that will be answered with a false; then the other $8$ questions must be answered with a true. This gives $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to answer the test with exactly $2$ falses.

There are $\binom{10}{1}$ ways to choose the $1$ question that will be answered with a false; then the other $9$ questions must be answered with a true. This gives $\binom{10}{1} = 10$ ways to answer the test with exactly $1$ false.

Thus, there are $45 + 10 = 55$ ways to answer the test with at most $2$ falses. Therefore, there are $$2^{10} - 55 = \boxed{969}$$ ways to answer the test with at least $3$ falses.

Let $x$ be the measure of the each of the equal sides.  Since the perimeter is 10 units, the side lengths measure $x$, $x$, and $10-2x$ units.  Since the third side length must be positive, we have $10-2x>0$ which implies $x<5$.  By the triangle inequality, the sum of the two equal sides must exceed the third side.  Solving  $x+x>10-2x$ gives $x>2.5$.  There are $\boxed{2}$ integers strictly between 2.5 and 5.

Let $a$ be the length of the two equal sides, and let $b$ be the length of the remaining side. Then we have $2a+b=10$, so $b=10-2a$. By the triangle inequality, $a+b>a$ and $a+b>a$, or equivalently, $b>a-a/2$ and $a>b-b/2$. Substituting $b=10-2a$ into these inequalities gives $10-3a>a/2$ and $a>4$, and $a>5$ and $10-3a>b/2$. The only integer satisfying both inequalities is $a=6$. Then $b=10-2a=2$, so the only non-congruent isosceles triangle with perimeter 10 and integer side lengths is the one with sides $6$, $6$, and $2$. Therefore, there is only $\boxed{1}$ such triangle.

As in Solution 2, we know that the third diagonal of Pascal's Triangle can be represented by the function $\binom{n}{2}$. Since the $50$th triangular number is $\frac{50\cdot51}{2}=1275$, we need to find the value of $n$ such that $\binom{n}{2}=1275$. Solving for $n$ gives $n=51$. Therefore, the $50$th triangular number is $1275$.

Alternatively, we note that the $n$th triangular number is equal to $\binom{n+1}{2}$, so we want to find $n$ such that $\binom{n+1}{2}=1275$. We can solve for $n$ again to find that $n=50$. Therefore, the $50$th triangular number is $1275$.

The number of ways to choose one white ball and one black ball is $5k$, since there are 5 choices for the white ball and $k$ choices for the black ball.  The number of ways to pick any 2 balls out of $(k+5)$ balls is $\dbinom{k+5}{2}=\dfrac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}$.  So we have to solve for $k$ in the equation \[\frac{5k}{\frac{(k+5)(k+4)}{2}}=\frac{10}{21}.\]After clearing the denominators, we can simplify to $210k = 10(k+5)(k+4)$, giving the quadratic $10k^2 - 120k + 200 = 0$.  This is the same as $k^2 - 12k + 20 = 0$, which factors as $(k-2)(k-10)=0$, so its solutions are $k={2}$ or $k={10}$. Since the problem is asking for the smallest value, $\boxed{2}$ is the correct answer.

Solving for $k$, we have $$k = \dfrac{99}{20} - \dfrac{1}{20}\sqrt{3361}.$$ The smallest integer greater than or equal to $\dfrac{99}{20} - \dfrac{1}{20}\sqrt{3361}$ is $\boxed{4}$.

Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers.  Observe that $ab-(a+b)=(a-1)(b-1)-1$.  This quantity is non-negative unless either $a$ or $b$ equals 1.  Therefore, the only pairs of positive integers for which the sum exceeds the product are those of the form $\{1,n\}$ where $n$ is a positive integer.  In this case, there are 4 such pairs: $\{1,2\}$, $\{1,3\}$, $\{1,4\}$, and $\{1,5\}$.  There are a total of $\binom{5}{2}=10$ pairs of integers, so the probability that the sum exceeds the product is $\frac{4}{10}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

To get a sum less than a product, the two numbers must multiply to $5$ or greater.
There are two ways this can occur: 1) they are $2$ and $3$, or 2) they are $2$, $4$, or $5$.  Thus there are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ total possibilities.  The probability of choosing $2$ and $3$ is $\frac{1}{\binom{5}{2}} = \frac{1}{10}$, and the probability of one of the other three possibilities is $\frac{3}{\binom{5}{2}} = \frac{3}{10}$.  Thus, the desired probability is $\frac{1}{10}+\frac{3}{10}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
As in other problems involving inequalities, we first find the number of outcomes for which the inequality is satisfied, and then divide that by the total number of outcomes.  If we fix one die, e.g. the first one, then the inequality $ab>a+b$ is satisfied either when $a>b+1$ or $b>a+1$, where $a$ is the number on that die and $b$ is the number on the other.  For each value of $a$, there are $8-a$ possible values of $b$ (since $b$ can't be equal to $a$), so we get a total of \[ \sum_{a=1}^8 (8-a) = 8+7+6+\cdots+1 = 36 \] outcomes where the inequality is satisfied in this case.  (Note that we could get the same total using the symmetry between $a$ and $b$.)

Since each die has 8 faces, there are a total of $8^2 = 64$ possible outcomes, all of which are equally likely.  Therefore, the probability we seek is $\frac{36}{64}=\boxed{\frac{9}{16}}$.

There are nine possible products, as there are three different numbers upon which the first spinner could land and three different numbers upon which the second spinner could land. If the first spinner lands on $-3$ or $-1$, the second spinner can land on either 2 or 4 to create a negative product, giving four possibilities. If the first spinner lands on the 5, the second spinner must land on the $-6$ to create a negative product. Thus, there are five possible ways to create a negative product, so the probability that the product of the values is negative is $\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$.

Now, we must seat the remaining 5 Native Americans in seats 3-7.

Let's consider each category of items individually. 

For the entrees, Crystal has 4 options to choose from, so she can pick any one of them. 

For the drinks, Crystal has 2 options to choose from, so she can pick any one of them. 

For the desserts, Crystal has 2 options to choose from, so she can pick any one of them. 

To calculate the total cost of the meal, we can add the prices of the entree, drink, and dessert. If she picks the pizza, lemonade, and frozen yogurt, her total cost is $3.50+1.50+3.00=\$8.00$. This would be too expensive for her budget, so she can't pick this combination. If we do the same calculation for each possible combination of items, we get:

\begin{align*}

We can use the identity $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$ to solve this problem. Starting with $\binom{14}{7}$, we can repeatedly apply this identity to get:

\begin{align*}
\binom{14}{7} &= \binom{13}{6} + \binom{13}{7} \\
&= \binom{12}{5} + \binom{12}{6} + \binom{12}{6} + \binom{12}{7} \\
&= \binom{11}{4} + \binom{11}{5} + \binom{11}{5} + \binom{11}{6} + \binom{11}{5} + \binom{11}{6} + \binom{11}{6} + \binom{11}{7} \\
&= \binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{6} \\
&\qquad + \binom{10}{4} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{6} + \binom{10}{5} + \binom{10}{6} + \binom{10}{6} + \binom{10}{7} \\
&= \cdots \\
&= \binom{8}{1} + \binom{8}{2} + \cdots + \binom{8}{7} + \binom{8}{0}.
\end{align*}

We can stop this process because we have reduced the top number to 8, and there are 8 choose 7 terms in the final sum.

So, we have shown that $\binom{14}{7} = \binom{8}{1} + \binom{8}{2} + \cdots + \binom{8}{7} + \binom{8}{0}$. To compute $\binom{15}{7}$, we just add one more term to this sum: $\binom{8}{0}$. Therefore, we have:

\begin{align*}
\binom{15}{7} &= \binom{14}{7} + \binom{14}{6} \\
&= \binom{8}{1} + \binom{8}{2} + \cdots + \binom{8}{7} + \binom{8}{0} + \binom{14}{6} \\
&= 1 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 + \binom{14}{8} \\
&= 2\binom{8}{1} + 2\binom{8}{2} + 2\binom{8}{3} + 2\binom{8}{4} + \binom{14}{8} \\
&= 2(8 + 28 + 56 + 70) + \binom{14}{8} \\
&= 2(162) + 3003 \\
&= \boxed{3327}.

We'll start with the naive estimate that there are $5^4=625$ colorings, since there are 5 choices for the color of each square. Obviously, some colorings will be counted more than once. Consider a general coloring and the three other colorings obtained by rotating it. If all four squares are the same color, in 5 of the 625 colorings, we get the same thing when we rotate it, so these are not overcounted. If opposite squares match but adjacent ones do not, then we get two colorings that should be counted together, so we are double-counting these $5\cdot4=20$ colorings (there are 5 choices for one color and 4 for the other color). In the other $5^4-5-20=600$ cases, we quadruple-count the colorings, since there are four of the original colorings that are really the same. Therefore, the total number of distinct colorings is $$5+\frac{20}2+\frac{600}4=5+10+150=\boxed{165}.$$[asy]

We consider using Burnsides Lemma on the group of rotations of the square. 
First we count the fixed points of $I$ (the identity or no rotation), of which there are $5^4$. Next, we count the number of fixed points of $R_{90}$ which is given by the number of colorings fixed under 90 degree rotations about the center, which is $5^2$. The fixed points of $R_{180}$ consist of two cases: $A A B B$ or $A B A B$ where the two pairs are of the same color, and there are $5$ colors for $A$ and $4$ remaining colors for $B$. So there are $5\cdot 4 + 5\cdot 4 = 40$ fixed points. Finally, we consider fixed points of $R_{270}$ which can be either $A A A A$, $A A B B$, or $A B A B$. There are $5$ fixed points of the first case. If the $4$ colors are $A A B B$, there are $5$ ways to assign the colors to the pairs, and if the colors are $A B A B$, there are two ways to place $A$. Since there are ${4\choose 2}=6$ ways to choose the pairs of colors, the number of ways to color these four cases is $5+5\cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 6 = 23$. Hence by Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinguishable colorings is $$\frac{1}{4}(5^4 + 2\cdot 5^2 + 2\cdot 40 + 4\cdot 23) = \boxed{65}.$$

It is impossible for Pat to select both 3 oranges and 6 apples, so we can calculate the probabilities of these mutually exclusive cases separately and then add to get our final answer. The probability that 3 particular pieces of fruit will be oranges and the rest will not be is given by $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^5=\dfrac{32}{6561}$, and there are $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways of selecting three pieces of fruit to be the oranges so the probability that 3 will be oranges is $56\cdot\dfrac{32}{6561}=\dfrac{1792}{6561}$. Similarly, the probability that 6 particular pieces of fruit will be apples and the other two won't be is given by $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^6\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2=\dfrac{4}{6561}$ and there are $\binom{8}{6}=28$ ways of selecting which ones will be the apples, so multiplying again gives us a probability of $28\cdot\dfrac{4}{6561}=\dfrac{112}{6561}$. Adding those two probabilities give us our final answer: $\dfrac{1792}{6561}+\dfrac{112}{6561}=\boxed{\dfrac{1904}{6561}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the binomial probability formula for each case separately, and then add the probabilities together.

For the first case, we want the probability that exactly 3 out of 8 fruits are oranges. The probability of one fruit being an orange is 1/3, so the probability of one fruit not being an orange (either an apple or a banana) is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 3 oranges out of 8 fruits can be calculated as:

P(3 oranges) = (8 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^5

where (8 choose 3) is the number of ways to choose 3 items out of 8, which is equal to 56.

Now, for the second case, we want the probability that exactly 6 out of 8 fruits are apples. The probability of one fruit being an apple is 1/3, so the probability of one fruit not being an apple is 2/3. Therefore, the probability of getting exactly 6 apples out of 8 fruits can be calculated as:

P(6 apples) = (8 choose 6) * (1/3)^6 * (2/3)^2

where (8 choose 6) is the number of ways to choose 6 items out of 8, which is equal to 28.

Finally, we can add the two probabilities together:

P(3 oranges or 6 apples) = P(3 oranges) + P(6 apples)
= (8 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^5 + (8 choose 6) * (1/3)^6 * (2/3)^2
= 0.279

Therefore, the probability that either exactly 3 of the pieces of fruit are oranges or exactly 6 of the pieces of fruit are apples is approximately 0.279 or 27.9%.

The walk and non-walk could come in either order, so the probability is $\frac{2}{5} \cdot \frac{3}{5} + \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = 2 \cdot \frac{6}{25} = \boxed{\frac{12}{25}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are four possible outcomes for Larry's two plate appearances: 

BB, N
BN, B
NN, B
B, NN

where "BB" represents two walks, "BN" represents a walk followed by an out, and so on. The probability of each of these outcomes can be found by multiplying the probability of each individual event together. For example, the probability of "BB" is $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{25}$, since Larry needs to earn a walk on both plate appearances.

We are interested in the probability that Larry earns a walk exactly once, which can happen in either of the middle two outcomes. The probability of "BN" is $\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = \frac{6}{25}$, since there are two possible orders for the events ("walk, out" or "out, walk") and the probability of an out is $\frac{3}{5}$ (the complement of a walk). Similarly, the probability of "NN, B" is $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = \frac{6}{25}$.

Adding these two probabilities together, we get $\frac{6}{25}+\frac{6}{25}=\boxed{\frac{12}{25}}$.

To divide 12 dimes into three piles with an odd number of dimes in each pile is to express 12 as a sum of three odd numbers. This is impossible to do, since $12=2\cdot6$ is even and the sum of three odd integers is odd: $(2l+1)+(2m+1)+(2n+1)=2l+2m+2n+3=2(l+m+n+1)+1$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{0}$ ways to divide the dimes as described.

We can start by distributing one dime to each pile to ensure that all three piles have an odd number of dimes. This leaves 9 dimes to be distributed among the three piles. We can use stars and bars to count the number of ways to do this. Placing two dividers among the 9 dimes creates three piles: the first pile contains the dimes to the left of the first divider, the second pile contains the dimes between the first and second dividers, and the third pile contains the dimes to the right of the second divider. There are 8 spaces between the 9 dimes where the dividers could go, so there are $\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to divide the remaining 9 dimes among the three piles. Therefore, there are $28$ ways to divide the 12 dimes into three piles with an odd number of dimes in each pile.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways for Matt to choose his 3 cards, all of which are equally likely. 

If Ryan chooses 3 Paper cards, then Matt must have chosen 3 Rock cards that Ryan will beat. There are $\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways for Ryan to choose which 3 of his 5 Paper cards to play, and $\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways for Matt to choose his 3 Rock cards. So there are $10\cdot56=560$ total possible combinations of cards that could be played.

If Ryan chooses 2 Paper cards and 1 Scissors card, then Matt must have chosen 2 Rock cards and 1 Paper card. In this case, Ryan will win 2 out of 3 battles, but not in a landslide. So we only need to consider the case where all 3 of Ryan's cards are Paper.

The probability that Ryan chooses a Paper card on his first draw is $\frac{5}{8}$. Assuming he chooses a Paper card on his first draw, the probability that he chooses another Paper card on his second draw is $\frac{4}{7}$. Assuming he chooses a Paper card on his first two draws, the probability that he chooses another Paper card on his third draw is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$. So the probability that Ryan beats Matt in a landslide by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row is:

$$
\frac{5}{8}\cdot\frac{4}{7}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{5}{28}
$$

Therefore, the probability that Ryan beats Matt by choosing 3 Paper cards in a row is $\frac{10}{560}+\frac{5}{28}=\boxed{\frac{1}{14}}$.

We know that every third whole number starting from one must be removed from the list. Since the greatest multiple of $3$ less than $100$ is $3\cdot33=99$, this gives us a total of $33$ such numbers. We then consider the multiples of four. Every fourth whole number starting from one is a multiple of four and since $4 \cdot 25=100$, this gives us $25$ such numbers. However, we also have to account for the numbers that are multiples of both $3$ and $4$ which we counted twice. These are the multiples of $12$ (the least common multiple of $3$ and $4$). Since $100 \div 12 = 8 \text{ R}4$, we know that there are $8$ multiples of both $3$ and $4$. Thus, we have $33+25-8=50$ numbers that we removed from the list. Since there were $100$ whole numbers total, this leaves us with $100-50=\boxed{50}$ whole numbers.

We first need to find how many multiples of 3 and 4 there are from 1 to 100. 

Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ... 99
To find how many multiples of 3 there are, we need to divide 100 by 3 and round down to the nearest whole number because the last multiple of 3 before 100 is 99. 

100 ÷ 3 = 33.333...
Round down to 33.
There are 33 multiples of 3 from 1 to 100. 

Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, ... 96, 100
To find how many multiples of 4 there are, we need to divide 100 by 4 and round down to the nearest whole number because the last multiple of 4 before 100 is 100.

100 ÷ 4 = 25
There are 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100. 

However, we have counted some numbers twice, specifically the multiples of both 3 and 4 (i.e. multiples of 12). To find how many of these numbers there are, we need to divide 100 by the least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 4, which is 12. 

100 ÷ 12 = 8.333...
Round down to 8.
There are 8 numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 4 from 1 to 100. 

To find how many whole numbers are left after removing the multiples of 3 and 4, we need to subtract the total number of multiples from 100, and then add back the 8 numbers that were double counted. 

Total number of multiples: 33 + 25 - 8 = 50
100 - 50 + 8 = 58
There are 58 whole numbers left after removing the multiples of 3 and 4 from the list of whole numbers 1 through 100.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are three possible outcomes after the first roll: a loss (3 options), a win with a matching number (1 option), and a second roll (3 options). Since the die is fair, each of these outcomes is equally likely. If the player wins with a matching number, they break even since they paid $\$5$ to play. Therefore, the expected value of the game is equal to the probability of losing multiplied by the amount lost plus the probability of a second roll multiplied by the probability of winning on that roll multiplied by the amount won. We can express this as the following equation: $$\frac{3}{6}\cdot(\$5)+\frac{3}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}\cdot (\text{amount won})= \$5.$$Simplifying this equation gives $\frac{9}{12}(\text{amount won})=\frac{3}{2},$ so $\text{amount won}=\boxed{\$2}.$

We first find the prime factorizations of each number:

5! &= 2^3 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \\
10! &= 2^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1 \\
15! &= 2^{11} \cdot 3^6 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 7^2 \cdot 11^1 \cdot 13^1
\end{align*}

To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of these three numbers, we need to find the highest power of each prime that appears in all three factorizations. For example, the power of 2 in the GCF is the minimum of the powers of 2 in the factorizations of the three numbers. Following this method, we obtain:

\begin{align*}

The product $ab$ is prime only when either $a$ or $b$ is one. Since $b$ cannot equal 1, $a$ must equal 1, and this occurs with probability $\frac14$. Furthermore, $b$ must be prime, so $b$ must equal 5 or 7, and this occurs with probability $\frac25$. Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is prime is $\frac14\cdot \frac25 = \boxed{\frac1{10}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Note that the only two multiples of primes in the two sets are $6$ and $9$. Thus, when $a$ is chosen to be a multiple of $2$ or $3$ (which happens with probability $\frac{2}{4}$), the product $ab$ will not be prime. When $a$ is chosen to be $1$ or $4$ (which happens with probability $\frac{2}{4}$), there is a greater chance that $ab$ is prime, since only $b=5$ and $b=7$ produce composite results. Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is prime is greater when $a=1$ or $4$, and is in either case $\frac{3}{5}$ (since there are $3$ prime numbers in the set $\{5,6,7,8,9\}$). Thus, the desired probability is $\frac{2}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{5} + \frac{2}{4}\cdot\frac{3}{5} + \frac{2}{4}\cdot\frac{3}{5}=\boxed{\frac{9}{20}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$7! = 5040$, $8! = 40320$, and the tens digit of $9!$ is 8. We look at every term in the series after 9! and note that since 100 has no prime factors besides 2 and 5, its factorial ends in double 0, which will not affect the tens digit of the sum. Every subsequent term, then, will contribute a units digit of 0, so we ignore them. 

Therefore, we want to find the tens digit of $7!+8!+9!$. We estimate the answer by taking out a factor of $7!=5040$: $7!+8!+9!=5040(1+8+\frac{9!}{7!})=5040(1+8+\frac{9\cdot 8}{5})$. Since $1+8+\frac{9\cdot 8}{5}=18.2$, $\boxed{8}$ is the tens digit of the sum.

To find out how many different battalions can be sent, we need to divide the total number of soldiers by the number required for each battalion. 

For the upper class soldiers, there are 5 soldiers in total and we need 4 for each battalion. Therefore, we can send only one battalion of upper class soldiers. 

For the lower class soldiers, there are 10 soldiers in total and we need 8 for each battalion. Therefore, we can send one battalion with all 10 lower class soldiers or we can send one battalion with 8 lower class soldiers and have 2 left over. 

Therefore, there are two different battalions that can be sent: 
1. One battalion with 4 upper class soldiers and 8 lower class soldiers

On her first turn, Kendra must get 10 points.  If she wants a total of 30 after three turns, she must then either get two tens in a row or a 5 and then a 15.  To get three tens in a row, she can move any direction on her first move, go in two possible directions for her second move, and go in two possible directions for her third spin, meaning her probability of success is $\frac{1}{4}$.  On the other hand, if she wants to get a 10, a 5, and a 15, she can only move left or right on her first move, further out on her second move, and then up or down on her third move, leading to a probability of success of $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$.  Adding, her total probability is $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{16} = \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
After three complete turns, Kendra will have visited twelve squares on the board. There are several ways to solve the problem, but probably the easiest is to use casework based on her final position. In order for Kendra's sum of scores to equal 30 in three turns or $12$ moves, her final position must be worth $0$ or $30$, and two additional squares must be worth $0$, $5$ or $10$ and the other nine squares must be worth $5$ or $10$.

If Kendra lands on a white square with an even number, then her next move must be to a black square with an odd number, and so it is impossible for her to end up at $30$. Furthermore, if Kendra lands on a black square with an odd number, then her next move must be to a white square with an even number, after which she can reach a black square with an odd number and then reach a score of $30$. Therefore, Kendra's final position must be at a black square with an odd number.

Suppose Kendra ends on a black square with a score of $5$. Then Kendra's previous two moves must be to an even-numbered white square, which there are four of, and her next two moves must be to a black square with a score of $10$. There will be two such squares available to Kendra. For the remaining eight moves, Kendra has two choices, either a black square with a $5$ or an even-numbered white square. Thus, there are \[4\cdot 2\cdot 2^8 = 2048\]ways for Kendra to achieve a score of $30$ if her final position has a score of $5$.

Suppose Kendra ends on a black square with a score of $15$. Then Kendra must have traveled to any two of the other three black squares with odd numbers which are not connected to the square with a score of $20$. From each of these two squares there will be two available squares with a score of $5$ and one with a score of $10$, for a total of ${4 \choose 2} \times (2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2) = 48$ choices. After this, Kendra must land on the square with a score of $20$, of which there is one choice. Thus, there are a total of $2\times 48 = 96$ ways for Kendra to achieve a score of $30$ if her final position has a score of $15$.

Finally, suppose Kendra ends on a black square with a score of $25$. Then Kendra must have traveled to each of the other three black squares with odd numbers at least once (the square with a score of $20$ will be visited twice). Kendra then has two choices from each of the three visited squares with a score of $5$ or one choice of the visited square with a score of $10$, for ${3 \choose 1} \cdot 2^3 + {3 \choose 1} \cdot 1^3 = 18$ choices. There is then only one choice of the square with a score of $20$. For the eight remaining moves, Kendra has the two choices of a black square with a score of $5$ or an even-numbered white square. Thus, there are $18 \cdot 2^8 = 4608$ ways for Kendra to achieve a score of $30$ if her final position has a score of $25$.

Together, we have $2,048 + 96 + 4,608 = 6,752$ attainable ways out of $2^6 \cdot 3^4 = 20736$ possible choices for each turn. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{169}{648}}$.

For the ball to end up back in the center, the ball must deflect left 4 of the 8 times, and right the other 4 times. There are $\binom{8}{4}$ ways to pick which 4 of the rows to deflect the ball left and then the other 4 to deflect it right.  Each deflection is to the left with probability $\frac12$ and to the right with probability $\frac12$, so each possible path to the bottom occurs with probability $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{\!8}$.  Thus, the probability that 4 out of 8 deflections go left and the ball goes in the middle is \[\binom{8}{4}\frac{1}{2^8}=\boxed{\frac{35}{128}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
Call the probability that a ball will end up in the middle slot after passing through $n$ pegs $P_n$. We are looking for $P_8$.

Notice that $P_0 = 1$, i.e. if the ball doesn't pass through any pegs, it ends up in the middle slot. For $n>0$, we can express $P_n$ recursively as:
\begin{align*}
P_n &= \frac{1}{2} P_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} P_{n}\\
P_n &= \frac{1}{2} P_{n-1}
\end{align*}
where the first equation comes from the fact that the ball can only end up in the middle slot if it left the peg before the middle slot via the left side, or it left via the right side.

From there, it's easy to see that $P_n = \frac{1}{2^n}$ for all $n$, and so $P_8 = \frac{1}{2^8} = \boxed{\frac{1}{256}}$.

Since there are six candidates for president, the presidential candidates can be ordered in $6! = 720$ ways. Likewise, there are $4! = 24$ vice presidential permutations. And $5! = 120$ secretarial permutations. Finally, $3! = 6$ treasurer permutations. We must multiply the number of permutations for each position, since each ballot includes all the position permutations: $720 \cdot 24 \cdot 120 \cdot 6 = \boxed{12441600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the candidates for each office separately, and then multiply these numbers together to get the total number of arrangements.

For the president position, there are 6 candidates, so there are 6 ways to choose the first name on the ballot, 5 ways to choose the next name, 4 ways to choose the third name, and so on, until there is only 1 name left to choose. This gives us $6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1$ ways to arrange the presidential candidates.

For the vice president position, there are 4 candidates remaining, so there are 4 ways to choose the first name on the ballot, 3 ways to choose the next name, and so on, until there are only 2 names left to choose. This gives us $4\times 3\times 2\times 1$ ways to arrange the vice presidential candidates.

For the secretary position, there are 5 candidates remaining, so there are 5 ways to choose the first name on the ballot, 4 ways to choose the next name, and so on, until there are only 1 name left to choose. This gives us $5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1$ ways to arrange the secretary candidates.

For the treasurer position, there are 3 candidates remaining, so there are 3 ways to choose the first name on the ballot, 2 ways to choose the next name, and finally 1 way to choose the last name. This gives us $3\times 2\times 1$ ways to arrange the treasurer candidates.

To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply all these numbers together:

$$(6\times 5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1)\times (4\times 3\times 2\times 1)\times (5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1)\times (3\times 2\times 1)$$

This simplifies to:

$$720\times 24\times 120\times 6$$

And this product equals $\boxed{12441600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If we consider the possible cases, there are two ways that the first two balls can be the same color: either they are both red, or they are both green, or they are both blue, since these are the three colors represented in the bag. We begin by computing the probability that the first two balls are both red. Once we have that, we can find the probabilities for green and blue by symmetry.

If the first ball is red, the probability that the second ball is also red is $\frac{3}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{3}$, since there are three balls left, and only one of them is red. 

If the first ball is not red, the probability that the second ball is red is $\frac{1}{3}$, since there is one red ball left, out of three total balls. So the probability that the first two balls are both red is: $$P(RR) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{\frac{5}{36}},$$ where the first term in the sum is the probability that the first ball drawn is red, and the second term is the probability that it is not red.

If Julie includes one of the colors that cover three cupcakes, she must also include the other color that covers three cupcakes. This is because she must make ten cupcakes total, and all of the other colors cover an even number of cupcakes, so there is no way to make ten with three and some combination of even numbers. Thus, if she includes blue and violet, she has four cupcakes left to choose. There are three ways in which she can choose four cupcakes if she chooses colors that cover two (green and orange, green and yellow, or orange and yellow). Alternately, she can choose a color that covers four (red). Finally, if she doesn't include any colors that cover three cupcakes, she must choose all of the other cupcakes in order to make ten. Thus, Julie has $\boxed{5}$ different combinations of cupcakes.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the three-digit number have hundreds digit $a$ and units digit $c$. The middle digit must be a multiple of 3, and so the number is of the form $3b$; note that $b$ is not necessarily an integer. Thus the number is in the form $300b+10c+a$, with $b$ ranging over all nonnegative real numbers less than 4. ($b = 4$ will not work since the resulting number will have more than three digits.)

Since $a$ cannot be 0, there are 9 choices for $a$.

Since $b$ can range over all nonnegative real numbers less than 4, there are infinitely many values it can take on. However, for each possible value of $c$ (nine values), there is exactly one allowed value of $b$ that makes the entire number a three-digit number. Thus there are $\boxed{9 \cdot 9 = 81}$ such numbers.

Extracting Answer from: 
Consider the six faces of the cube as six unit squares. Without loss  of generality, we "color" three of them: red, blue, and green.  Since  every triangle must have vertices on different faces, there are  $\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways to choose the colors of the faces that the vertices of our  triangle lie on.

Case 1: Three vertices are located on three different faces of the same color.
There are six faces to choose from, but once we choose the color, the  vertices can be arranged in $3!=6$ ways. Thus, there are $6\times 3=18$ triangles in this case.

Case 2: Two vertices are located on two different faces of the same color,  and the third vertex is located on a different colored face.
There are $\binom{3}{2}\cdot2=6$ ways to pick the colors of the two faces with vertices. Once we've done that, there are $4$ possible locations for the third vertex (on the remaining three faces), and once we've selected the location, there are $2$ possible ways to place the vertices on the selected faces. This gives $6\cdot 4 \cdot 2=48$ triangles in this case.

Case 3: Each vertex is located on a different colored face.
There are $(3!)^2=36$ ways to place the vertices (as there are $3!$ ways to choose a color for each of the two vertices). However, we must divide by $3!$ to account for the overcounting that occurs by counting arrangements which  differ only by rotation as distinct. (Note that we must use division by $3!$, as opposed to $3$, since the three vertices are distinguishable, and thus there are $3!$ ways to rearrange them.) This gives ${36}/{6}=6$ triangles in this case.

Thus, in total, there are $18+48+6=\boxed{72}$ non-congruent triangles that can  be drawn.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two cases: either the first person chosen is a boy and the second is a girl, or the first is a girl and the second is a boy.

The probability of choosing a boy first is $\dfrac{12}{20}$, or simplifying, $\dfrac{3}{5}$. The probability of choosing a girl second is $\dfrac{8}{19}$, since there are only 8 girls left in the club after one has been chosen. Therefore, the probability of choosing a boy first and a girl second is $\dfrac{3}{5} \cdot \dfrac{8}{19} = \dfrac{24}{95}$.

The probability of choosing a girl first is $\dfrac{8}{20}$, or simplifying, $\dfrac{2}{5}$. The probability of choosing a boy second is $\dfrac{12}{19}$. Therefore, the probability of choosing a girl first and a boy second is $\dfrac{2}{5} \cdot \dfrac{12}{19} = \dfrac{24}{95}$.

Adding these two probabilities gives the total probability of choosing a boy and a girl: $\dfrac{24}{95} + \dfrac{24}{95} = \boxed{\dfrac{48}{95}}$.

There are 15 choices for the first player in the lineup, then 14 choices for the second player, then 13 choices for the third player, and so on, down to 5 choices for the 11th player. This gives us $(15)(14)(13)\cdots(5)$ ways to choose the starting lineup. 

Now we need to designate two of these players as captains. We can choose the first captain in 11 ways (since any of the 11 players in the lineup could be the first captain), and we can choose the second captain in 10 ways (since any of the remaining 10 players could be the second captain). However, the order in which we choose the captains doesn't matter, so we've counted each combination twice (once for each order of choosing the captains). Therefore, we need to divide our total count by 2 to correct for this overcounting.

Overall, the number of ways to choose the starting lineup and designate the captains is given by:

Then, she can distribute the three remaining apples among her four friends, using stars and bars. That means she needs to place three apples among four people, which would require three dividers. For example, if the dividers are placed as follows: $$\big|\,\big|\,a\,\big|\,a\big|,$$

There are $9!$ ways to put the beads on the grid, not taking rotations, reflections, and the restriction on the purple and green beads into account. We need to subtract off the number of arrangements where the purple and green beads are adjacent from this number. There are $2\cdot3=6$ horizontally adjacent pairs of locations, $3\cdot2=6$ vertically adjacent ones, and $2\cdot2+2\cdot2=8$ pairs of diagonally adjacent locations. For each of these pairs, there are two ways to put the purple and green beads in them, and $7!$ ways to put the rest of the beads on the grid, giving a total of $2(6+6+8)7!=40\cdot7!$ invalid arrangements. So, the number of valid arrangements not counting rotations and reflections is $9!-40\cdot7!=(9\cdot8-40)7!=32\cdot7!$. The grid can be rotated onto itself in four different ways, by rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. It can also be reflected onto itself in four different ways, by reflecting across its two diagonals and through horizontal and vertical lines through its center. So, the arrangements come in groups of $4+4=8$ equivalent arrangements, and the number of different arrangements is $32\cdot7!/8=4\cdot7!=\boxed{20160}$.

First, we place the purple and green beads. We can choose 2 out of the 4 corner squares to place them in $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways. Once we have placed these two beads, we are left with two cases.

Case 1: The purple and green beads are placed diagonally opposite each other.

In this case, we have the following grid:
[asy]
unitsize(1cm);
draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle);
draw((1,0)--(1,3));
draw((2,0)--(2,3));

draw((0,2)--(3,2));
draw((1.5,1.5)--(2.5,2.5));
draw((2.5,1.5)--(1.5,2.5));
[/asy]
We have 7 squares remaining to fill with 7 differently colored beads. There are $7!$ ways to place these beads, but we must divide by 4 to account for rotations/reflections. This gives us $\dfrac{7!}{4} = 10,\!080$ ways.

Case 2: The purple and green beads are placed adjacent to each other.

In this case, we have either of the following two grids:
[asy]
unitsize(1cm);
draw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle);
draw((1,0)--(1,3));
draw((2,0)--(2,3));

draw((1,1)--(2,1)--(2,2)--(1,2)--cycle);
draw((.5,.5)--(1.5,1.5));
draw((2.5,1.5)--(1.5,.5));

We can place these beads in the following ways:

draw((1,0)--(1,3));

In each diagram, we can see that there are 5 squares remaining to fill with 5 differently colored beads. There are $5!$ ways to place these beads, but we must divide by 4 to account for rotations/reflections. Therefore, there are $2\cdot 5!/4 = 60$ ways for each diagram, giving us a total of $2\cdot 60 = 120$ ways for this case.

There are 12 total slices, and 5 of them have pepperoni and 8 have mushrooms. Let $n$ be the number that have both toppings. So, there are $5-n$ slices with only pepperoni and $8-n$ with only mushrooms.  So, there are a total of $n + (5-n) + (8-n)$ slices.  Since there are 12 slices, we have $(5-n) + (8-n) + n = 12$, from which we find that $n=\boxed{1}$.

A 5-digit number can have for its leftmost digit anything from 1 to 9 inclusive, and for each of its next four digits anything from 0 through 9 inclusive. Thus there are $9\times 10\times 10\times 10\times 10=90,\!000$ 5-digit numbers.

In this problem, Mr. Cole is really selecting two separate groups.  He can choose 3 girls from the 6 girls total in $$ \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 20 $$ways, and 5 boys from the 11 boys total in $$ \binom{11}{5} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 462 $$ways.  Since these two selections are independent (since for each of the 20 ways to pick the girls, there are 462 ways to pick the boys), we multiply them together to get the number of ways that we can form the 8-member trip: $$ \binom{6}{3}\binom{11}{5} = (20)(462) = \boxed{9,\!240}. $$

There are only two possibilities: either all 5 balls go in one box, or 3 balls go in one box and 2 balls go in the other box. 

For the first case, there is only one way to put all 5 balls in one box. 

For the second case, there are two ways to choose which box gets 3 balls and which gets 2. Once that choice is made, there is only one way to put the balls in each box since the balls are not distinguishable. Therefore, there are 2 ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if neither the balls nor the boxes are distinguishable. 

Therefore, the total number of ways is 1 + 2 = $\boxed{3}$.

We can compute this a few ways, but the numbers seem small enough that we can go ahead and just compute the probability of A being selected all three days, and the probability of A being selected exactly 2 of the three days. Team A is selected on any given day with probability $\frac{2}{3}$, because there are ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ possible pairs of teams, and 2 of them contain A. So, there is a $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{27}$ chance of being selected all three days. Of being selected exactly twice, there is a $\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot {3 \choose 2} = \frac{4}{9}$ chance. Adding these two yields $\frac{8}{27} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{8+12}{27} = \boxed{\frac{20}{27}}$.

The best way to do this is to find the probability that the two E's are next to each other.  There are $\dfrac{7!}{2}$ arrangements of the word SIXTEEN.  If we want to find the number of arrangements such that the E's are next to each other, we find the number of arrangements of the six-letter word SIXT(EE)N (where we treat the two E's as a block), which is $6!$.  So the probability that an arrangement of the word SIXTEEN has the two E's next to each other is $\dfrac{6!}{\frac{7!}{2}} = \dfrac{2}{7}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will begin by finding the total number of ways to arrange the letters of the word SIXTEEN.  There are 7 letters, but E appears twice, so we must divide by 2! to correct for overcounting.  The total number of arrangements is thus $\frac{7!}{2!}=25,\!200$.

Next, we will count the number of arrangements in which the two E's are next to each other.  We can think of the two E's as a single block, which can be arranged with the other five letters in $6!=720$ ways.  However, within the block of two E's, the two letters themselves can be arranged in 2 ways (either "EE" or "EE").  Thus, there are $2\cdot 720=1,\!440$ arrangements in which the two E's are next to each other.

Finally, we can find the number of arrangements in which the two E's are not next to each other by subtracting the number of arrangements in which they are next to each other from the total number of arrangements:
$$25,\!200-1,\!440=23,\!760.$$ Therefore, the probability that the two E's are not next to each other is $\frac{23,\!760}{25,\!200}=\boxed{\frac{99}{105}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are four cases to consider:

If $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then $a\cdot b$ is positive.
If $a$ and $b$ are both negative, then $a\cdot b$ is positive.
If $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, then $a\cdot b$ is negative.
If $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative, then $a\cdot b$ is negative.

Thus, our probability is the sum of the probabilities of the first two cases, which correspond to $a$ and $b$ being either both positive or both negative. We can find these probabilities by dividing the area of the rectangle $-3\le a \le 1$, $-2\le b \le 4$ into regions where the first two cases hold, and then dividing by the total area of the rectangle.

draw((0,-2)--(0,4),dashed);
label("$a$", (1,-0.5));
label("$b$", (-0.5,4));
[/asy]

The region where $a$ and $b$ are both positive is the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,4)$, which has area $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4=2$. The region where $a$ and $b$ are both negative is the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,-2)$, and $(-3,-2)$, which has area $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3\cdot 2=3$.

Since Bin $A$ has one white ball and four black balls, the money ball has a $\dfrac{1}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $W$ and a $\dfrac{4}{5}$ chance of coming from Bin $B$.  The total expected value therefore is $E = \dfrac{1}{5}E_W + \dfrac{4}{5}E_B$, where $E_W$ and $E_B$ are the expected values of a ball drawn from bins $W$ and $B$, respectively.  Since Bin $W$ has five 8 dollar balls and one 500 dollar ball, its expected value is \[ E_W = \frac{5}{6}\times\$8 + \frac{1}{6}\times\$500 = \$90. \]Since Bin $B$ has three 1 dollar balls and one 7 dollar ball, its expected value is \[ E_B = \frac{3}{4} \times \$1 + \frac{1}{4} \times \$7 = \$2.5. \]Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{5}E_W + \frac{4}{5}E_B = \frac{1}{5}(\$90) + \frac{4}{5}(\$2.5) = \boxed{\$20}. \]

The probability of selecting a black ball from bin $A$ is $\frac{4}{5}$, and the probability of selecting a white ball from bin $A$ is $\frac{1}{5}$. Therefore, the total expected win can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
&\frac{4}{5}\left(\frac{3(\$1) + 1(\$7)}{4}\right) + \frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{5(\$8) + 1(\$500)}{6}\right) \\
&= \frac{4}{5}(\$2) + \frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{40 + 500}{6}\right) \\
&= \frac{4}{5}(\$2) + \frac{540}{30} \\
&= \$2.80.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the expected win is $\boxed{\$2.80}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need exactly two flips to come up heads and three to come up tails. The odds that two flips come up heads is $\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2$ and the odds that the other three all come up tails is $\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3$. We then need to consider the distinct ways of positioning the heads among the 5 flips: we can put the first one in any of 5 places and the second one in any of the remaining 4 places, but they aren't distinct so we need divide by 2 for a total of $\dfrac{5\times4}{2}=10$ ways. Thus the probability is $\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2\times\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3\times10=\boxed{\dfrac{40}{243}}$.

Alternatively, we can view flipping this coin 5 times as being equivalent to the expansion of $(h+t)^5$ where $h=\frac{2}{3}$ and $t=\frac{1}{3}$. The value of the $h^nt^{5-n}$ term in this expansion will be the probability of getting exactly $n$ heads, so setting $n=2$ and applying the binomial theorem gives us $p=\dbinom{5}{2}\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3=\boxed{\dfrac{40}{243}}$, which is the same answer we got using the other method.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the binomial distribution to model the number of heads we get when we flip the coin 5 times. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of heads. Then, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=5$ (the number of trials) and $p=\dfrac{2}{3}$ (the probability of success, which is getting heads).

The probability of getting exactly two heads can be found as:

$$\begin{aligned}P(\text{exactly 2 heads}) &= \binom{5}{2}p^2(1-p)^3 \\ &= \binom{5}{2}\left(\dfrac{2}{3}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{1}{3}\right)^3 \\ &= \dfrac{10\cdot 4}{81}\cdot \dfrac{1}{27} \\ &= \boxed{\dfrac{40}{2187}} \approx 0.0183.\end{aligned}$$

In general, \[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\]

Consider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\boxed{1092}$.

We can solve this problem by dividing it into cases. If Markov rolls a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will flip a coin on the second turn. He must flip a heads to flip a coin on his third turn. There is a $\frac{2}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$ chance of this case happening. If Markov does not roll a 1 or 2 on the first turn, he will roll the die on the second turn. He must roll a 1 or 2 on the second turn to flip a coin on the third turn. There is a $\frac{4}{6}\cdot \frac{2}{6}=\frac{2}{9}$ chance of this case happening. The total probability that Markov will flip a coin on the third turn is then $\frac{1}{6}+\frac{2}{9}=\boxed{\frac{7}{18}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are four cases to consider for the first two turns: 
1. Markov rolls the die twice 
2. Markov rolls the die, then flips the coin 
3. Markov flips the coin, then rolls the die 
4. Markov flips the coin twice 

For Case 1, the probability of each roll being a 1 or 2 is $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$, so the probability of rolling the die twice is $\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2=\frac{1}{9}$.

For Case 2, the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on the first turn is $\frac{1}{3}$, and the probability of flipping heads on the second turn is $\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability of this sequence is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6}$.

For Case 3, the probability of flipping tails on the first turn is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on the second turn is $\frac{1}{3}$, so the probability of this sequence is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{6}$.

For Case 4, the probability of flipping tails twice is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}$.

Therefore, the probability that Markov will flip the coin on the third turn is:

$$\frac{\text{Case 2}+\text{Case 3}+\text{Case 4}}{\text{Total probability}}=\frac{\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{9}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{11}{31}.$$

The original rectangle may be subdivided into four smaller congruent rectangles, all sharing $O$ as a vertex. Each of these rectangles is analogous, so we can consider our random point $P$ to be without loss of generality in the smaller rectangle with $A$ as a vertex. All points in this smaller rectangle are closer to $A$ than they are to $B$, $C$, or $D$, so we just need to determine the probability that $OP<AP$. [asy]

[/asy] Since a $180^\circ$ rotation about the center of the smaller rectangle takes $O$ to $A$, it takes the shaded region to the unshaded region. Therefore, exactly half the area is shaded, and the overall probability is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$, independent of $k$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/731_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Without loss of generality, assume that $k\geq1$. The condition that the point is closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices simply defines a region with $AB\perp AD$ bisecting $A$ and $C$, and also bisecting $\angle AOD$ and $\angle COB$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Define the angles $\theta_1=\angle AOP$ and $\theta_2=\angle BOQ$. We can then obtain $PQ$ in terms of $k,\theta_1,\theta_2$ by using the Law of Sines twice on triangles $AOP$ and $BOQ$:
\begin{align*} \frac{AB}{\sin\theta_1} &= 2OP = 2\frac{AD}{2}\tan\theta_2 = AD \cdot \frac{2\tan\theta_2}{1+\tan^2\theta_2} \\ \frac{AB}{\sin\theta_2} &= 2OQ = 2\frac{AB}{2}\tan\theta_1 = AB \cdot \frac{2\tan\theta_1}{1+\tan^2\theta_1} \end{align*}
Then consider the ratio of the shaded area to the area of the rectangle so that we can scale the problem to a unit square without loss of generality. All values of $k,\theta_1,\theta_2$ which satisfy the characterization above correspond to unique values of $PQ$, from which we can derive a relation between the two. To do so, we square both equations above and add them to get
\[\frac{4}{k^2}\cdot\frac{\cos^2\theta_1\cos^2\theta_2}{(1+\tan^2\theta_1)(1+\tan^2\theta_2)} = PQ^2 \]
Now, it remains to perform change of variables from $k,\theta_1,\theta_2$ to $PQ$, which can be done by considering the area differential contributed by each differential $dPQ$:
\[dA = 2(PQ\, dPQ)\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2\cdot\frac{d\theta_1d\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1\sin\theta_2} = 4\cdot\frac{PQ^2}{k^2}\cdot d\left(\ln PQ\right)\]
Then the desired area may be written as
\begin{align*} \text{area} &= 8\int_{\ln\frac{2}{k}}^{\infty}\frac{x^2}{\left(e^{2x}-1\right)\left(e^{2x}-k^2\right)}\, dx \\ &= 2\int_{-\ln\frac{2}{k}}^{\ln\frac{2}{k}}\frac{x^2}{\left(e^{2x}-1\right)\left(e^{2x}-k^2\right)}\, dx \\ &= \frac14\int_{-\ln\frac{2}{k}}^{\ln\frac{2}{k}}\frac{(x+1)-1}{\left(1-e^{-2(x+1)}\right)\left(1-e^{-2(x-1)}\cdot k^2\right)}\, dx \\ &= \frac14\left[\left(\frac12\ln\left(\frac{x+1}{1-e^{-2(x+1)}}\right) - \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2-1}}\arctan\frac{e^{x-1}}{\sqrt{k^2-1}}\right)\right]_{-\ln\frac{2}{k}}^{\ln\frac{2}{k}} \\ &= \boxed{\frac{\ln k}{2k} + \frac{1}{2(k^2+1)}} \end{align*}

We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.

The probability that Mike draws no cards from one of the suits is $\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{39}{52}\right)^5$. However, we've undercounted the probability that he draws no cards from two suits. To count this probability, we must subtract out the probability that he draws no cards from two particular suits, which is $\binom{2}{1}\left(\frac{26}{52}\right)^5$. Thus, the probability that he draws a card from at least three of the suits is \begin{align*}
1-\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{39}{52}\right)^5+\binom{2}{1}\left(\frac{26}{52}\right)^5 &= 1-\frac{3\cdot 39^5-2\cdot 26^5}{52^5} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $6\times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes when rolling two dice, since there are 6 possibilities for the first die and 6 possibilities for the second die. Rolling the same number on both dice is one of the 6 possible outcomes where the first die shows some number (say, 1) and the second die shows the same number (1 in this case). Therefore, there are 6 possible outcomes where the two dice show the same number, and the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is $\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}$.

The $2\times 2\times 2$ cube in the center of the box does not touch any of the bottom or lateral sides. For each of the $6$ faces of this $2\times 2\times 2$ cube, there are two $1\times 2\times 2$ blocks of $4$ cubes each that share a face with the larger cube and touch one of the lateral faces of the box. Additionally, there are $4\cdot 2=8$ corner cubes that each touch two lateral faces of the box. Therefore, the total number of small cubes that touch the bottom or one of the four lateral sides of the box is $$6 \cdot 2\cdot 4 + 8 = \boxed{56}.$$[asy]

There are $6^3=216$ total cubes in the $6\times 6\times 6$ cube.

Consider the cubes in the interior. There are $4\cdot 4\cdot 4=64$ of them. Each has $0$ painted faces.

Now consider the cubes on the edges (not counting the corners). Each of these has $1$ painted face. There are $4\cdot 4\cdot 6=96$ such cubes.

Now consider the corners. Each of these has $3$ painted faces. There are $8$ of them.

So in total, there are $64\cdot 0+96\cdot 1+8\cdot 3=120$ painted faces on the unit cubes. This is equivalent to $120/216=\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}$ of the unit cubes having at least two painted faces.

The only way to multiply two odd numbers is to get an odd product.  Thus both numbers chosen must be even to get an even product. The chance that the first number chosen is even is $\frac{2}{4}$; then the chance that the second number chosen is even is $\frac{1}{3}$ (since one number is gone).

There is a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) ^4=\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\cdot \frac{1}{81}=\boxed{\frac{2}{27}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the total number of possible orders that can be made by the 4 people. Since each person has 3 options, the total number of possible orders is $3^4 = 81$.

Next, we need to count the number of ways in which 2 people order meat brats and the other 2 order hot dogs. There are $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose which 2 people will order meat brats, and the other 2 people will automatically order hot dogs. For each of these 6 possible pairs of meat brat orders, there are 3 choices for each person, so there are $3^4$ total possible orders in which 2 people order meat brats and the other 2 order hot dogs.

Therefore, the probability is $$\frac{3^4}{81} \cdot 6 = \frac{2^8}{3^2 \cdot 3^4} \cdot 6 = \frac{64}{81}.$$ So the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs is $\boxed{\frac{64}{81}}$.

Answer from Original: 3

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/761_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but one common method is to use a Venn diagram. We can start by drawing two overlapping circles to represent the groups of boxes that contain pencils and pens, respectively:

```
____________
   /  |      |  \
  /   |      |   \
P |    |      |    | 
  |____|______|____|
       C      P
```

We know that there are five boxes with pencils, so we label the left circle with "P = 5". Similarly, there are four boxes with pens, so we label the right circle with "C (for pens in Chinese) = 4". Finally, we know that two boxes contain both, so we write "2" in the intersection of the circles:

```
____________
   /  |      |  \
  /   |  2   |   \
P |    |______|____| 
  |____|______|____|
       C      P
```

Now we can use this diagram to find the number of boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils, which corresponds to the area outside both circles. To do this, we need to subtract the total number of boxes (10) from the number of boxes that contain pens, pencils, or both. We can write this as:

Neither = Total - (P + C - Both)

Substituting the values we have, we get:

Neither = 10 - (5 + 4 - 2) = 3

Therefore, there are 3 boxes that contain neither pens nor pencils. We can double-check this by counting the boxes that we have already accounted for: 5 with pencils, 4 with pens, and 2 with both, for a total of 11.

We can assume that the circle has its center at $(0,0)$ and a radius of $1$. Call the three points $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $a$, $b$, and $c$ denote the length of the counterclockwise arc from $(1,0)$ to $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Rotating the circle if necessary, we can also assume that $a= \pi/3$. Since $b$ and $c$ are chosen at random from $[0, 2\pi)$, the ordered pair $(b,c)$ is chosen at random from a square with area $4\pi^2$ in the $bc$-plane. The condition of the problem is met if and only if \[
0<b<\frac{2\pi}{3}, \quad 0<c<\frac{2\pi}{3},
\quad\text{and}\quad |b-c|<\frac{\pi}{3}.
\]This last inequality is equivalent to $b-\dfrac{\pi}{3}<c<b+\frac{\pi}{3}$.

The graph of the common solution to these inequalities is the shaded region shown. The area of this region is \[
\left(\frac{6}{8}\right)\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right)^2 =
\pi^2/3,
\]so the requested probability is \[

Extracting Answer from: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the circle has radius $1$.  Fix one point, and call it $O$.  Without loss of generality, we can assume that this point is $(1,0)$. Suppose that the second point is $A = (\cos \theta,\sin \theta)$.

[asy]
pair O=(0,0), A=dir(20), Ap=A+(0,-1)*abs(A-(0,-1)), B=dir(135), C=dir(270);
draw(unitcircle);
dot(O); dot(A); dot(Ap); dot(B); dot(C);
draw(A--B--C--cycle);
draw(O--B);
[/asy]

Then when the third point $C$ is chosen, it must lie in a certain "sweet spot" - the region bounded by lines $OA$ and $OB$ and the minor arc $\widehat{AB}$:

[asy]
pair O=(0,0), A=dir(20), Ap=A+(0,-1)*abs(A-(0,-1)), B=dir(135), C=dir(-50);
draw(unitcircle);
dot(O); dot(A); dot(Ap); dot(B); dot(C);
draw(A--B, dashed);
draw(O--C);
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$B$", B, N);
label("$O$", O, N);
label("$C$", C, SE);
draw(A--C--B);
[/asy]

If $C$ does not lie in this "sweet spot", then the pairwise distances $OA$, $OB$, $AB$ are all greater than $1$ and the condition is not satisfied.  Furthermore, $C$ must not be too close to $O$ or too close to $A$, since otherwise $AB$ will be greater than the radius of the circle.


[asy]
pair O=(0,0), A=dir(20), Ap=A+(0,-1)*abs(A-(0,-1)), B=dir(135), C=dir(-50);
draw(unitcircle);
dot(O); dot(A); dot(Ap); dot(B); dot(C);
draw(A--B, dashed);
draw(O--C);
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$B$", B, N);
label("$O$", O, N);
label("$C$", C, SE);
draw(A--C--B);
draw(O--Ap);
draw(A--Ap--B, dashed);
label("$\theta$", (0.7,0.2));
[/asy]

In particular, $C$ must lie in a region bounded by two concentric circles as well as two lines:

[asy]
unitsize(3cm);
pair O=(0,0), A=dir(20), Ap=A+(0,-1)*abs(A-(0,-1)), B=dir(135), C=dir(-50);
draw(unitcircle);
dot(O); dot(A); dot(B); dot(C);
draw(A--B, dashed);
draw(O--C);
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$B$", B, N);
label("$O$", O, N);
label("$C$", C, SE);
draw(C--foot(C,O,A), dashed);
draw(C--foot(C,A,B), dashed);
draw(circle(O,1.2));
draw(circle(O,0.45));
label("$\theta$", (0.7,0.2));
[/asy]

Thus, if $O$ and $A$ are fixed, then the set of possible $C$ is a region bounded by two small circles and two lines within a larger circle. This larger circle has area $\pi$, and we claim that the region within it where the pairwise distances are less than $1$ has area $\pi/4$. Thus, the probability we seek is $\frac{1}{\pi} \cdot \frac{\pi}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$

[asy]
size(200);
pair O=(0,0), A=dir(20), Ap=A+(0,-1)*abs(A-(0,-1)), B=dir(135);
draw(unitcircle);
draw(A--B--O--cycle, dashed);
label("$A$", A, N);
label("$B$", B, N);
label("$O$", O, N);
fill(arc(O,B,A)--B--cycle,gray(.8));
fill((0,-1)--foot(O,A,B)--foot(O,B,A)--cycle,white);
draw(arc(O,B,A));
draw(O--A);
draw(O--B);
draw(A--foot(O,A,B));
draw(B--foot(O,B,A));
label("Sweet spot", dir(140)*.8, white);
label("$\displaystyle\frac{\pi}{2}$", dir(140)*.4);
[/asy]

This claim can be proven by symmetry.  Choose a third point $C$ uniformly at random, and reflect it over the $x$-axis to produce point $C'$.  Then $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle AB'C'$ are congruent, so the probability that all pairwise distances are less than the radius is the same as the probability that all pairwise distances are greater than the radius. Since these two probabilities add up to $1$, each must be $\frac{1}{2}$, so the desired probability is $\frac{1}{2}$ of $\frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

Let's start by adding up the total number of games won by all players:

$$4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13$$

We know that there are a total of 6 players in the tournament, and each player plays 5 games (since they don't play against themselves). Therefore, there were a total of $6 \cdot 5 = 30$ games played. We can use this information to find out how many games Monica must have won:

$$\text{Total games won by Monica} = \text{Total games} - \text{Total games won by all other players}$$

$$\text{Total games won by Monica} = 30 - 13 = 17$$

Therefore, Monica won 17 games.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the number of students taking physics, so the number in chemistry is $2x$.  There are 15 students taking all three, and 30 students in both physics and calculus, meaning there are $30 - 15 = 15$ students in just physics and calculus.  Similarly there are $60$ students in just chemistry and calculus, and $60$ in physics and chemistry.  Since there are $x$ students in physics and $15 + 15 + 60 = 90$ students taking physics along with other classes, $x - 90$ students are just taking physics.  Similarly, there are $2x - 135$ students taking just chemistry and $90$ students taking just calculus.  Knowing that there are 15 students not taking any of them, the sum of these eight categories is 360, the total number of people at the school:   \[
(x - 90) + (2x - 135) + 90 + 60 + 15 + 60 + 15 + 15 = 360.

Let $x$ be the number of students taking all three, $y$ be the number taking physics and chemistry but not calculus, and $z$ be the number taking all three minus the 15 students already counted. 

We know that 15 students take all three, so $x = 15$. We also know that 15 students don't take any of the three, so the sum of the other regions is $360-15=345$. Thus, we have 

\begin{align*}
y + z + 75 + 80 -x &= 345 \\
y + z &= 275.
\end{align*}

We know that 75 students take both calculus and chemistry, and they are accounted for in $x$ and $y$. Thus, the number of students taking at least chemistry is $75+z$, and this is also equal to $2\times(\text{number of physics students})$. 

Finally, we know that 30 students take both physics and calculus, and they are accounted for in $x$ and $y$. Thus, the number of students taking at least physics is $30+y$, and this is also equal to half of $\left(75 + (75+z)\right)$. 

Putting everything together: 

\begin{align*}
30+y &= \frac{150+z}{2} \\
75+z &= 2(30+y) \\
y+z &= 275 \\
x &= 15.
\end{align*}

Solving this system of equations gives $y = 35$, $z = 240$, which means that the number of students taking physics is $30+y = \boxed{65}$.

If $A_1$ is connected to all the points, then there are $n-1$ triangles with $A_1$ as a vertex. If $A_2$ is not connected to $A_1$ in a side, it is then connected to $(n-2)$ points, so there are $\binom{n-2}{2}$ triangles with $A_2$ as a vertex, because it forms triangles with $A_1$. Similarly, there are $\binom{n-4}{2}$ triangles with $A_3$ as a vertex, and so forth. Since every vertex has the same number of triangles, we know that $$\binom{n-2}{2}+\cdots+\binom{1}{2} = \frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2}.$$When we simplify the expression, $\tfrac{n(n-1)}{2} = 120 \implies n = \boxed{16}$

There are only two kinds of rectangles of area 8 square units which we can form on the grid: $2\times4$ rectangles and $4\times2$ rectangles. For $2\times4$ rectangles, the upper left unit square of the rectangle must be in the left three columns and top five rows, giving 15 possible locations. Similarly, there are 15 possible locations for a $4\times2$ rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles of area 8 which can be formed is $\boxed{30}$.

We find the probability that Javier does not suffer an allergic reaction, and subtract from 1. For Javier to not suffer an allergic reaction, the server must choose wheat or white bread; turkey, roast beef, or ham; and ranch sauce. The probability of this occurring is $\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability that Javier suffers an allergic reaction is $1-\frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two possible ways to approach this problem: listing all possible sandwiches and counting the ones that Javier can't eat, or using conditional probability.

Method 1: listing sandwiches

There are 3 choices of bread, 4 choices of meat, and 2 choices of sauce, for a total of 3x4x2=24 possible sandwiches. Out of these, Javier can't eat:

- 2 sandwiches with rye bread (ham or turkey with rye + any sauce)
- 1 sandwich with tuna (any bread + tuna + any sauce)
- 2 sandwiches with southwest chipotle sauce (any bread + any meat + southwest chipotle)

Therefore, there are 24-2-1-2=19 sandwiches that Javier can eat, and 5 that he can't. The probability of suffering an allergic reaction is 5/24, or about 20.8%.

Method 2: using conditional probability

Let's denote the event "Javier suffers an allergic reaction" by A. We want to find P(A). By the law of total probability, we can write:

P(A) = P(A|rye)P(rye) + P(A|tuna)P(tuna) + P(A|chipotle)P(chipotle) + P(A|none)P(none),

where P(rye)=1/3 is the probability of getting rye bread, P(tuna)=1/4 is the probability of getting tuna, P(chipotle)=1/2 is the probability of getting southwest chipotle sauce, and P(none)=1- P(rye)-P(tuna)-P(chipotle)=1/4 is the probability of getting any other combination.

Now we need to compute the conditional probabilities. If Javier gets rye bread, he can't eat any sandwich, so P(A|rye)=1. If he gets tuna, he can't eat the tuna sandwich, so P(A|tuna)=1/2 (there are 2 sauces left). If he gets southwest chipotle sauce, he can't eat any sandwich with that sauce, so P(A|chipotle)=2/3 (there are 2 breads and 4 meats left). If he gets any other combination, he can eat any sandwich, so P(A|none)=0.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A) = 1/3 x 1 + 1/4 x 1/2 + 1/2 x 2/3 + 1/4 x 0 = 5/24.

This confirms the previous result using Method 1. Therefore, the probability that Javier will suffer an allergic reaction is 5/24, or about 20.8%.

Indeed, we see from the identity $$n! + (n!) \times n = (n+1) \times n! = (n+1)!$$that the sum will be equal to $51!$. The largest prime number to divide this quantity will be the largest prime number less than or equal to $51$, which is $\boxed{47}$.

We observe that a cube has four red faces if and only if it is an exterior cube on the figure, and we can color only those with red faces without affecting other cubes.

There are 14 cubes. In the figure, there are 8 exterior cubes with $3$ red faces and $6$ exterior cubes with $2$ red faces.

Suppose that the figure had exactly $k$ red faces painted.  The number of exterior cubes is the same whether the figure is assembled or separate, so that all 24 cubes in the separate figure contribute to these counts. Therefore, the number of painted faces would be $3\cdot8+2\cdot6+(24-(8+6))\cdot1=26$.

But we know that there are 56 exterior faces on the assembled figure, so that the number of red faces painted is $56/6=\boxed{9\text{ faces}}$ on each of three faces of two cubes and $56/4=\boxed{14\text{ faces}}$ on each of six cubes, for a total of $3\cdot9+6\cdot14=\boxed{99\text{ faces}}$.

$\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$. In order for this fraction to be odd, neither $n$ nor $n-1$ can be divisible by $4$, because only one of $n$ and $n-1$ can be even. There are $25$ integers where $n$ is divisible by $4$, namely the multiples of $4$ from $4$ to $100$. There are $24$ integers where $n-1$ is divisible by $4$. We can obtain these integers by incrementing all the multiples of $4$ by $1$, but we must not include $100$ since $100+1 = 101 > 100$. Therefore, there are $49$ invalid integers, so there are $99 - 49 = \boxed{50}$ valid integers.

The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\text{both red}) = P(\text{1st red}) \times P(\text{2nd red \textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\frac{4}{10}$.

Therefore $$ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{4}{10}\times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\text{both blue}) = P(\text{1st blue}) \times P(\text{2nd blue \textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\frac{6}{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two cases to consider: both marbles are red and both are blue.

To calculate the probability that both marbles are red, we first select a red marble from the bag. The probability of this is $\dfrac{4}{10}$. We then have 3 red marbles and 6 blue marbles left in the bag, and so the probability of selecting another red marble is $\dfrac{3}{9}$. Therefore, the probability of selecting two red marbles in a row is:

$$\dfrac{4}{10} \cdot \dfrac{3}{9} = \dfrac{2}{15}$$

To calculate the probability that both marbles are blue, we first select a blue marble from the bag. The probability of this is $\dfrac{6}{10}$. We then have 4 red marbles and 5 blue marbles left in the bag, and so the probability of selecting another blue marble is $\dfrac{5}{9}$. Therefore, the probability of selecting two blue marbles in a row is:

$$\dfrac{6}{10} \cdot \dfrac{5}{9} = \dfrac{1}{3}$$

So the total probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is:

$$\dfrac{2}{15} + \dfrac{1}{3} = \boxed{\dfrac{7}{15}}$$

If $\sqrt{a+\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\leq a \leq 10$, $1\leq c\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.

Let $c=\sqrt{a+\sqrt{b}}$. Squaring both sides yields $c^2=a+\sqrt{b}$. 

Since $c$ is an integer, $a+\sqrt{b}$ must be a perfect square. Let this perfect square be $d^2$. Then we have $d^2=a+\sqrt{b}$, so $\sqrt{b}=d^2-a$. 

Since $1\le b\le 36$, we have $1\le\sqrt{b}\le 6$. Note that if $\sqrt{b}$ is an integer, then $a=d^2-\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer. Thus, we have the following possible values for $(a,b)$:

The arithmetic mean equals the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements in the row. In Pascal's Triangle where the first row is $n=0$, row $n$ has $n+1$ elements and the sum of the elements is $2^n$, which makes the arithmetic mean $\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. Now we look for the value of $n$ that satisfies $51.2=\frac{2^n}{n+1}$. If $51.2(n+1)=2^n$ and $n$ is a non-negative integer, we know that $2^n>51.2\qquad\Rightarrow n\ge 6$. If $n=6$, $2^n=64$, but $51.2(7)$ is much greater than $64$ (we can estimate $51.2(7)$ with $50\cdot7=350$). With $n=7$ and $n=8$, we also find that $51.2(n+1)$ is greater than $2^n$. When we try $n=9$, we get $51.2(10)=2^{9}=512$, which is true. The value of $n$ is $\boxed{9}$.

Let $P_n$ be the probability that he is at vertex $A$ after $n$ flips. We wish to find $P_6.$

For $n=1,$ the probability of returning to $A$ is $1$ since he always starts at $A.$ Thus, $P_1=1.$

Suppose he is at vertex $A$ after $n$ flips. If he flips heads, he moves to vertex $C$ with probability $\frac12$ or to vertex $F$ with probability $\frac12.$ If he flips tails, he moves to vertex $D$ with probability $\frac12$ or to vertex $E$ with probability $\frac12.$ Therefore, \begin{align*}
P_{n+1}&=\frac12P_n\cdot\frac12+\frac12P_n\cdot\frac12+\frac12(1-P_n)\cdot\frac12+\frac12(1-P_n)\cdot\frac12 \\
&=P_n(1-P_n)+\frac14.
\end{align*} In particular, $P_2=\frac34$ and $P_3=\frac{35}{64}.$

Then, \begin{align*}
P_4&=P_3(1-P_3)+\frac14=\frac{35}{64}\cdot\frac{29}{64}+\frac14=\frac{949}{2048}, \\
P_5&=P_4(1-P_4)+\frac14=\frac{949}{2048}\cdot\frac{1099}{4096}+\frac14=\frac{44971}{1048576}.
\end{align*} Finally, \begin{align*}
P_6&=P_5(1-P_5)+\frac14=\frac{44971}{1048576}\cdot\frac{1007305}{4194304}+\frac14 \\
&=\frac{262769}{4194304}+\frac14=\frac{1374381}{4194304}.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $\binom{52}{3}$ ways to choose 3 cards, all of which are equally likely.  To count the number of pairs, we have to do some casework.

Case 1: The pair is of the same rank. There are $\binom{13}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the pair, and $\binom{4}{2}$ ways to choose which two cards make up the pair.  There are $\binom{12}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the third card, and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose that card.  So there are $\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose a pair of the same rank and a third card of a different rank.

Case 2: The pair is of different ranks. There are $\binom{13}{2}$ ways to choose the two ranks for the pair, and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose which card of each rank is in the pair.  There are $\binom{11}{1}$ ways to choose the rank of the third card, and $\binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose that card.  So there are $\binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{1} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1}$ ways to choose a pair of different ranks and a third card.

Therefore, the total number of pairs is $$\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{1} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1}.$$The probability that a randomly chosen 3-card hand forms a pair is then $$\frac{\binom{13}{1} \binom{4}{2} \binom{12}{1} \binom{4}{1} + \binom{13}{2} \binom{4}{1} \binom{11}{1} \binom{4}{1}}{\binom{52}{3}} = \boxed{\frac{109}{833}}.$$

Note that there are $4! = 24$ numbers ending in 1, since we have 4 choices for the 10s digit, 3 choices for the 100s digit, 2 choices for the 1000s digit, and 1 choice for the remaining digit.  Thus there are also 24 numbers ending in each of 3, 4, 5, 9, and the total contribution of ones digits to the sum is $24 (1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 9) = 528$.  But we can make a similar argument about the contribution of the digits in the other places (10s, 100s, etc.), so our total sum is $528 + 5280 + \ldots + 5280000 = 528 (1 + 10 + \ldots + 10000) = 528\cdot 11,111 = \boxed{5,\!866,\!608}$.

There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\dfrac{8 \times 5 \times 6!}{8} = 5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can solve this problem by first counting the total number of seatings without any restrictions, and then subtracting the number of seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other.

Without any restrictions, there are 8 people who can sit in the first seat, 7 people remaining who can sit in the second seat, and so on down to 1 person who can sit in the eighth seat. Therefore, there are $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 8!$ total seatings.

To count the number of seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other, we can think of them as a single "super-person" who must sit in one of 7 distinct pairs of adjacent seats. Once we place Alice and Bob together, there are then just 6 people remaining who can sit in the first seat, 5 people remaining who can sit in the second seat, and so on down to 1 person who can sit in the sixth seat. Therefore, there are $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 7!$ seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other.

To obtain the final answer, we subtract the number of bad seatings from the total number of seatings:

$$8! - 7! = 40,\!320 - 5,\!040 = \boxed{35,\!280}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling six dice. Each die has six possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes is $6^6=46656$.

Next, we need to determine the number of outcomes where exactly three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers.

There are 3 prime numbers among the first 6: 2, 3, and 5. Let's consider all possible arrangements of these 3 prime numbers and 3 composite numbers among the dice rolls. We can do this using combinations.

There are ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to be the ones showing prime numbers. For each of these choices, there are $3^3 = 27$ ways to arrange the 3 prime numbers among the 3 chosen dice, and $3^3 = 27$ ways to arrange the 3 composite numbers among the remaining 3 dice. Therefore, the total number of outcomes where exactly three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is $20\times 27^2 = 43740$.

Finally, we can determine the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: $$\frac{43740}{46656} \approx 0.9374.$$ Therefore, the probability that three of the dice show prime numbers and the rest show composite numbers is approximately $\boxed{0.9374}$.

Rewrite $x+y\leq 4$ as $y\leq 4-x$.  This inequality is satisfied by the points on and under the line $y=4-x$.  Sketching this line along with the $4\times 8$ rectangle determined by the inequalities $0\leq x\leq 8$ and $0\leq y\leq 4$, we find that the points satisfying $x+y\leq 4$ are those in the shaded triangle (see figure).  The  area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$ square units, and the area of the rectangle is $(4)(8)=32$ square units, so the probability that a randomly selected point would fall in the shaded triangle is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

Graphing the points satisfying $0\le x\le8$ and $0\le y\le4$, we see that $(x,y)$ can be any point in the rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(8,0)$, $(8,4)$ and $(0,4)$ and that the points satisfying the inequality $x+y\le4$ lie in the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(4,0)$ and $(0,4)$. If we shade the triangle and the rectangle, denoting the probability of landing in the triangle, we get the following figure:

[asy]
size(6cm);
fill((0,0)--(4,0)--(0,4)--cycle,lightgrey);

label("$x+y=8$",(7.5,0.5));
label("$x=8$",(8,2),E);
label("$y=4$",(4,4),N);
[/asy]

The area of the triangle is $4\cdot4/2=8$ and the area of the rectangle is $8\cdot4=32$, so the probability that a point $(x,y)$ randomly selected from the rectangle satisfies $x+y\le4$ is $\frac{8}{32}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

For each new polygon added to this sequence, we have the same number of new diagonals as the number of sides on the new polygon, because we can draw a diagonal from each new vertex to every other vertex that is not adjacent to it.

The first new polygon has $3$ sides, so it contributes $3$ diagonals. The second new polygon has $4$ sides, so it contributes $4$ diagonals. Continuing up to the fifth polygon gives a total of $3+4+5+6+7 = \boxed{25}$ new diagonals.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/805_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let $P_i$ denote the probability of rolling $i$ on one die. The probabilities for each die have to be equal since the dice are identical, so $P_i = \frac{1}{4}$ for $1\leq i\leq 4$. Let $X$ denote the player's return on one roll. We proceed with casework on the number the player chooses:

If the player chooses $1$, the probability of winning $\$1$ is $P_1\times(P_2+P_3+P_4) = \frac{3}{16}$ since exactly one die must show $1$ and the other die cannot show $1$, but can show any of the other three numbers. The probability of losing $\$1$ is $(P_2+P_3+P_4)^2 = \frac{9}{16}$ since neither die can show $1$. The probability of winning $\$2$ is $P_1^2 = \frac{1}{16}$ since both dice need to show $1$. Therefore, the expected value of $X$ if the player chooses $1$ is $$E(X|1) = (\$1)(\frac{3}{16}) + (\$(-1))(\frac{9}{16}) + (\$2)(\frac{1}{16}) = \$\frac{-1}{4}.$$
If the player chooses $2$, the probability of winning $\$1$ is $P_2\times(P_1+P_3+P_4) = \frac{3}{16}$. The probability of losing $\$1$ is $(P_1+P_3+P_4)^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. The probability of winning $\$2$ is $P_2^2 = \frac{1}{16}$. Therefore, the expected value of $X$ if the player chooses $2$ is $$E(X|2) = (\$1)(\frac{3}{16}) + (\$(-1))(\frac{9}{16}) + (\$2)(\frac{1}{16}) = \$\frac{-1}{4}.$$
If the player chooses $3$, the probability of winning $\$1$ is $P_3\times(P_1+P_2+P_4) = \frac{3}{16}$. The probability of losing $\$1$ is $(P_1+P_2+P_4)^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. The probability of winning $\$2$ is $P_3^2 = \frac{1}{16}$. Therefore, the expected value of $X$ if the player chooses $3$ is $$E(X|3) = (\$1)(\frac{3}{16}) + (\$(-1))(\frac{9}{16}) + (\$2)(\frac{1}{16}) = \$\frac{-1}{4}.$$
If the player chooses $4$, the probability of winning $\$1$ is $P_4\times(P_1+P_2+P_3) = \frac{3}{16}$. The probability of losing $\$1$ is $(P_1+P_2+P_3)^2 = \frac{9}{16}$. The probability of winning $\$2$ is $P_4^2 = \frac{1}{16}$. Therefore, the expected value of $X$ if the player chooses $4$ is $$E(X|4) = (\$1)(\frac{3}{16}) + (\$(-1))(\frac{9}{16}) + (\$2)(\frac{1}{16}) = \$\frac{-1}{4}.$$
Since the probabilities are the same for each choice, the overall expected value of $X$ is simply the average of our $4$ expected values: $$E(X) = \frac{(\$(-1)/4)+(\$(-1)/4)+(\$(-1)/4)+(\$(-1)/4)}{4} = \boxed{\$-\frac{1}{4}}.$$

If every letter of ``Hawaii" were different, there would be $6! = 6\cdot 5 \cdots 2 \cdot 1$ distinct six-letter rearrangements, since for the first letter of the rearrangement there would be six letters to choose from, for the second there would be five, etc. However, ``Hawaii" contains two copies of the letter $a$ and two copies of the letter $i$. Thus, we must divide by $2$ to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $a$'s, and we must divide by $2$ again to eliminate the overcounting we get from two indistinguishable $i$'s. Our final count is therefore $\frac{6!}{2\cdot 2}$. Canceling the $4$ top and bottom gives $6\cdot 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 30 \cdot 6 = \boxed{180}$.

When counting from $3$ to $201$, there are $199 - 3 + 1 = 197$ numbers counted. So $53$ is the $\dfrac{51}{197}^\text{th}$ fraction of the way from $3$ to $201$. In other words, $\dfrac{51}{197}$ of the $197$ numbers counted are less than $53$, and $\dfrac{197-51}{197}$ of the $197$ numbers counted are greater than $53$. We see that $\dfrac{12}{35}$ of the numbers from $3$ to $201$ are less than $53$, so $\dfrac{23}{35}$ of the numbers from $3$ to $201$ are greater than $53$, or $23\cdot 197/35$ numbers greater than $53$ when counting from $3$ to $201$. So $53$ is the $197-23\cdot 197/35 = 126^\text{th}$ number when counting backwards from $201$ to $3$. Our answer is $\boxed{126}$.

Since 1001 is the smallest 4-digit multiple of 7, we note that adding 7 to a 3-digit multiple of 7 will result in a 3-digit multiple of 7, unless the result is greater than 959 or less than 100.  Thus, the 3-digit multiples of 7 are 105, 112, 119, $\ldots$, 966.
Each of the first few of these yields only one possibility for the minute component of the time that Gerry wakes up:

\begin{tabular}{ccc]c} 105 & $\to$ & 1:45 & \\ 112 & $\to$ & 2:00 & \\ 119 & $\to$ & 2:17 & \\ 126 & $\to$ & 2:34 & \\ 133 & $\to$ & 2:51 & \\ \end{tabular}

However, when we reach $140=20\cdot 7$, the possibilities increase, since there are now two different multiples of 7 that Gerry can wake up to.

\begin{tabular}{ccc]c} 140 & $\to$ & 2:40 & \\ 147 & $\to$ & 2:57 & \\ & & 3:27 & \\ 154 & $\to$ & 3:14 & \\ & & 1:44 & \\ 161 & $\to$ & 3:31 & \\ & & 1:01 & \\ 168 & $\to$ & 1:48 & \\ & & 3:18 & \\ 175 & $\to$ & 1:15 & \\ & & 3:45 & \\ 182 & $\to$ & 1:22 & \\ & & 2:52 & \\ 189 & $\to$ & 1:59 & \\ & & 3:29 & \\ 196 & $\to$ & 2:36 & \\ & & 1:06 & \\ 203 & $\to$ & 2:03 & \\ & & 3:33 & \\ 210 & $\to$ & 2:10 & \\ & & 1:40 & \\ 217 & $\to$ & 2:47 & \\ & & 1:17 & \\ 224 & $\to$ & 1:24 & \\ & & 3:54 & \\ 231 & $\to$ & 1:51 & \\ & & 3:21 & \\ 238 & $\to$ & 2:28 & \\ & & 1:58 & \\ 245 & $\to$ & 2:05 & \\ & & 3:35 & \\ 252 & $\to$ & 2:22 & \\ & & 1:52 & \\ 259 & $\to$ & 2:59 & \\ & & 1:29 & \\ 266 & $\to$ & 3:26 & \\ & & 1:56 & \\ 273 & $\to$ & 3:03 & \\ & & 2:33 & \\ 280 & $\to$ & 3:10 & \\ & & 1:40 & \\ 287 & $\to$ & 3:47 & \\ & & 2:14 & \\ 294 & $\to$ & 1:34 & \\ & & 3:04 & \\ 301 & $\to$ & 2:01 & \\ & & 3:31 & \\ 308 & $\to$ & 2:08 & \\ & & 1:38 & \\ 315 & $\to$ & 2:45 & \\ & & 1:15 & \\ 322 & $\to$ & 1:22 & \\ & & 2:52 & \\ 329 & $\to$ & 1:59 & \\ & & 3:29 & \\ 336 & $\to$ & 1:36 & \\ & & 3:06 & \\ 343 & $\to$ & 2:13 & \\ & & 3:43 & \\ 350 & $\to$ & 2:20 & \\ & & 1:50 & \\ 357 & $\to$ & 3:27 & \\ & & 2:04 & \\ 364 & $\to$ & 2:34 & \\ & & 1:04 & \\ 371 & $\to$ & 1:41 & \\ & & 3:11 & \\ 378 & $\to$ & 1:08 & \\ & & 2:38 & \\ 385 & $\to$ & 1:45 & \\ & & 3:15 & \\ 392 & $\to$ & 2:22 & \\ & & 1:52 & \\ 399 & $\to$ & 3:29 & \\ & & 2:06 & \\ 406 & $\to$ & 3:06 & \\ & & 1:36 & \\ 413 & $\to$ & 3:43 & \\ & & 2:10 & \\ 420 & $\to$ & 2:20 & \\ & & 3:50 & \\ 427 & $\to$ & 1:57 & \\ & & 3:27 & \\ 434 & $\to$ & 1:24 & \\ & & 2:54 & \\ 441 & $\to$ & 2:01 & \\ & & 3:31 & \\ 448 & $\to$ & 3:08 & \\ & & 1:38 & \\ 455 & $\to$ & 1:15 & \\ & & 3:45 & \\ 462 & $\to$ & 2:42 & \\ & & 1:12 & \\ 469 & $\to$ & 3:19 & \\ & & 1:49 & \\ 476 & $\to$ & 1:16 & \\ & & 2:46 & \\ 483 & $\to$ & 1:23 & \\ & & 3:53 & \\ 490 & $\to$ & 1:00 & \\ & & 2:30 & \\ 497 & $\to$ & 2:37 & \\ & & 1:07 & \\ 504 & $\to$ & 3:04 & \\ & & 1:34 & \\ 511 & $\to$ & 3:11 & \\ & & 1:41 & \\ 518 & $\to$ & 1:48 & \\ & & 2:18 & \\ 525 & $\to$ & 2:25 & \\ & & 1:55 & \\ 532 & $\to$ & 3:32 & \\ & & 2:02 & \\ 539 & $\to$ & 2:39 & \\ & & 1:09 & \\ 546 & $\to$ & 3:16 & \\ & & 1:46 & \\ 553 & $\to$ & 3:23 & \\ & & 1:53 & \\ 560 & $\to$ & 2:40 & \\ & & 1:10 & \\ 567 & $\to$ & 2:47 & \\ & & 1:17 & \\ 574 & $\to$ & 1:44 & \\ & & 3:14 & \\ 581 & $\to$ & 3:21 & \\ & & 1:51 & \\ 588 & $\to$ & 1:18 & \\ & & 2:48 & \\ 595 & $\to$ & 1:55 & \\ & & 3:25 & \\ 602 & $\to$ & 2:22 & \\ & & 1:52 & \\ 609 & $\to$ & 3:29 & \\ & & 2:06 & \\ 616 & $\to$ & 3:06 & \\ & & 1:36 & \\ 623 & $\to$ & 2:13 & \\ & & 3:43 & \\ 630 & $\to$ & 2:30 & \\ & & 1:00 & \\ 637 & $\to$ & 1:37 & \\ & & 3:07 & \\ 644 & $\to$ & 3:14 & \\ & & 1:44 & \\ 651 & $\to$ & 1:51 & \\ & & 3:21 & \\ 658 & $\to$ & 2:28 & \\ & & 1:58 & \\ 665 & $\to$ & 1:25 & \\ & & 2:55 & \\ 672 & $\to$ & 2:32 & \\ & & 1:02 & \\ 679 & $\to$ & 2:09 & \\ & & 3:39 & \\ 686 & $\to$ & 1:36 & \\ & & 3:06 & \\ 693 & $\to$ & 2:03 & \\ & & 1:33 & \\ 700 & $\to$ & 1:40 & \\ & & 3:10 & \\ 707 & $\to$ & 3:17 & \\ & & 1:47 & \\ 714 & $\to$ & 1:14 & \\ & & 2:44 & \\ 721 & $\to$ & 2:51 & \\ & & 1:21 & \\ 728 & $\to$ & 2:58 & \\ & & 1:28 & \\ 735 & $\to$ & 1:35 & \\ & & 3:05 & \\ 742 & $\to$ & 2:12 & \\ & & 3:42 & \\ 749 & $\to$ & 2:19 & \\ & & 1:49 & \\ 756 & $\to$ & 3:26 & \\ & & 1:56 & \\ 763 & $\to$ & 3:03 & \\ & & 1:33 & \\ 770 & $\to$ & 1:50 & \\ & & 3:20 & \\ 777 & $\to$ & 2:27 & \\ & & 1:57 & \\ 784 & $\to$ & 1:24 & \\ & & 3:54 & \\ 791 & $\to$ & 2:01 & \\ & & 1:31 & \\ 798 & $\to$ & 2:38 & \\ & & 1:08 & \\ 805 & $\to$ & 1:15 & \\ & & 2:45 & \\ 812 & $\to$ & 3:12 & \\ & & 1:42 & \\ 819 & $\to$ & 3:19 & \\ & & 1:49 & \\ 826 & $\to$ & 1:26 & \\ & & 2:56 & \\ 833 & $\to$ & 3:33 & \\ & & 2:03 & \\ 840 & $\to$ & 2:40 & \\ & & 1:10 & \\ 847 & $\to$ & 2:17 & \\ & & 3:47 & \\ 854 & $\to$ & 3:24 & \\ & & 1:54 & \\ 861 & $\to$ & 1:21 & \\ & & 2:51 & \\ 868 & $\to$ & 2:58 & \\ & & 1:28 & \\ 875 & $\to$ & 1:55 & \\ & & 3:25 & \\ 882 & $\to$ & 1:22 & \\ & & 3:52 & \\ 889 & $\to$ & 1:59 & \\ & & 3:29 & \\ 896 & $\to$ & 2:36 & \\ & & 1:06 & \\ 903 & $\to$ & 2:13 & \\ & & 3:43 & \\ 910 & $\to$ & 3:10 & \\ & & 1:40 & \\ 917 & $\to$ & 2:47 & \\ & & 1:17 & \\ 924 & $\to$ & 1:24 & \\ & & 2:54 & \\ 931 & $\to$ & 3:31 & \\ & & 2:01 & \\ 938 & $\to$ & 2:08 & \\ & & 1:38 & \\ 945 & $\to$ & 1:45 & \\ & & 3:15 & \\ 952 & $\to$ & 2:22 & \\ & & 1:52 & \\ 959 & $\to$ & 2:59 & \\ \\ \end{tabular}

Thus, there are 14 times at which the three-digit number on Gerry's clock is a multiple of 7, and the probability that Gerry wakes up to such a time is $\boxed{\frac{7}{90}}$.

Proceed case-by-case in condition I. If $x = 1,$ then by condition II, $y = 1$ since the first two possibilities are excluded. If $y = 0,$ then either $x = 0$ or $x = 2.$ If $y = 2,$ then likewise, either $x = 0$ or $x = 2.$ This gives $\boxed{5}$ possible ordered pairs.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $3$ possible values for $x$ and $3$ possible values for $y$, and a pair $(x, y)$ satisfies both conditions if and only if it satisfies at least one of the subconditions in the first statement (I) and at least one of the subconditions in the second statement (II).

First suppose $x=1$. Then $y$ can be any of $0, 1, 2$, so there are $3$ possibilities satisfying the first subcondition from I. Therefore, we need only consider three cases of pairs $(x, y)$:

\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
x=1, y=0 \\
x=1, y=1 \\
x=1, y=2 \\
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Next suppose $x=0$ or $x=2$. Then $y$ must equal $1$, so these cases give us two more solutions. Now suppose $x\neq1$ and $y\notin\{0,2\}$. Then $x\in\{0,2\}$ and $y=1$, giving us two more solutions. Therefore, we consider the following $5$ cases of pairs $(x, y)$:

\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
x=1, y=0 \\
x=1, y=1 \\
x=1, y=2 \\
x=0, y=1 \\
x=2, y=1
\end{array}
\right.
\]

Each of these cases is easily seen to satisfy both conditions, so counting the solutions for each case gives the total number of pairs $(x, y)$ that satisfy both conditions:

\begin{align*}
\#(\text{pairs}(x,y)) &= 3 + 2 + 2 \\
& = \boxed{7}.

There are 90 possible choices for $x$.  Ten of these have a tens digit of 7, and nine have a units digit of 7.  Because 77 has been counted twice, there are $10 + 9 - 1 = 18$ choices of $x$ for which at least one digit is a 7.  Therefore the probability is $\frac{18}{90} = \boxed{\frac{1}{5}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can count the number of integers between 10 and 99 that do not contain a 7 as follows: For the tens digit, we have 9 choices (since we can't choose 0 or 7), and for the units digit, we have 9 choices as well (since we can't choose 7). Thus, there are $9\cdot 9 = 81$ integers that do not contain a 7.

Since there are $99-10+1 = 90$ integers between 10 and 99, the number of integers that contain at least one 7 is $90-81=9$.

Therefore, the probability that at least one digit of $x$ is a 7 is $\frac{9}{90} = \boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$.

We find the prime factorization for $3! = 6$ and $(3!)! = 720$ to get \[
{{\left((3!)!\right)!}\over{3!}} = \frac{720!}{6} = 2^{357}3^{172}\cdots.
\] Since $n$ is as large as possible, we need to find the largest factorial that is less than or equal to $720$. Our choices are $9!$ and $8!$, and since $8! < 720 < 9!$, we have $n=8$ and $k = \frac{720}{8!} = 5$. Thus, $k+n = 5+8 = \boxed{13}$.

If a four-digit integer is a palindrome, then its first and fourth digits are the same, and its second and third digits are the same. Thus, the first digit can be 2, 3, 4, or 5, but then the fourth digit must be the same. There are 4 choices for the first digit. For any given first digit, there is only one choice for the fourth digit, but since the second and third digits are the same, there are two choices for the second digit and two choices for the third digit.

Imagine labeling the vertices of the cube as shown, with $A$ at $1$ and $B$ at $8$.
[asy]
import three;
currentprojection=orthographic(1/2,-1,1/4);
triple A=(0,0,0), B=(1,1,1);
triple[] v = {A, A+(1,0,0), A+(1,1,0), A+(0,1,0),
              A+(0,0,1), A+(1,0,1), A+(1,1,1), A+(0,1,1)};
for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
    dot(v[i]);
    label((string) (i+1), v[i], dir(-v[i]));

[/asy]
There are only two vertices besides $A$ which are adjacent to each other, namely $1$ and $4$. If the path goes through $4$ in the second step, it must then go to $5$ in the third step, and then to $8$ in the final step. Similarly, if the path goes through $2$ at any point, it must then go to $3$ and then $8$.

Thus, three-step paths necessarily take the vertex $6$, which is adjacent to both $2$ and $4$ in one of the steps. From $6$, the path has two choices for its next step (either to $3$ or $5$), and then only one way to get to $8$. Therefore there are $\boxed{2}$ such paths.

We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{6} = \boxed{20}$ triangles.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/849_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are two ways we can approach this problem. 

Method 1: Using Burnside's Lemma 
We can use Burnside's Lemma to solve this problem efficiently. The number of distinct arrangements is equal to the average number of arrangements fixed by the rotations and reflections. 

- Identity: The identity rotation does not move any bead, so all $6!$ arrangements are fixed.
- $180^\circ$ rotation: There are no fixed individual beads, but each pair of opposite beads will be fixed. There are three pairs of opposite beads, so there are $2^3=8$ arrangements fixed by this rotation.
- $90^\circ$ and $270^\circ$ rotations: Each corner bead is fixed, but the other two beads can be swapped. So there are $2^2=4$ arrangements fixed by each of these rotations.
- Horizontal and vertical reflections: There are two rows and three columns that can be swapped, so there are $2^2=4$ arrangements fixed by each of these reflections.

Thus, the total number of distinct arrangements is $$\frac{1}{4}(6! + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) = \boxed{42}.$$


Method 2: Listing all cases
Alternatively, we can list out all the possible arrangements and then check which ones are duplicates. 

There are two beads that can be placed in the top left corner, and after placing them, there are four beads that can be placed in the middle, and then two beads left for the bottom right corner. There are $2\cdot 4\cdot 2 = 16$ different arrangements that we can create, as shown below.

[asy]
unitsize(20);
int[][] shapes = {{1,2,3,4,5,6}, {1,2,3,5,6,4}, {1,2,3,6,4,5}, {1,2,4,3,5,6}, {1,2,5,3,4,6}, {1,3,2,4,6,5}, {1,3,2,5,4,6}, {1,4,2,3,6,5}, {1,5,2,3,4,6}, {2,1,3,5,4,6}, {2,1,4,3,6,5}, {2,1,5,3,4,6}, {2,3,1,6,4,5}, {2,3,5,1,4,6}, {2,4,1,3,6,5}, {2,5,1,3,4,6}};
for (int i = 0; i < shapes.length; ++i) {
    int[] shape = shapes[i];
    for (int j = 1; j <= shape.length; ++j) {
        draw(circle((0.6*(j-1),-0.6*floor((j+2)/3)), 0.25));
        label("$"+string(shape[j-1])+"$",(0.6*(j-1),-0.6*floor((j+2)/3)));
    }
}
[/asy]

To check for duplicates, we can rotate each arrangement in four different ways, and flip each arrangement twice (once horizontally, and once vertically). If any of these rotations or flips match another arrangement, then the two arrangements are considered duplicates.

Using this method, we can conclude that there are $\dfrac{16}{2} = 8$ distinct arrangements.

Note: While this method works for a small grid like this $2 \times 3$ grid, it can quickly become impractical for larger grids. This is where Burnside's Lemma is useful.

For the first two cases, there is only one way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner. In the last case, there is no way to place another piece to cover the lower left corner without overlapping the first piece. In both of the first two cases, the two leftmost columns will be covered. So, we can use this logic again, on the top left square which has not yet been covered.

Let $\text{pow}_2(x)$ denote the highest power of $2$ dividing $x$. Note that for any set of distinct elements from the given set, its $\text{pow}_2$ value ranges from $0$ to $4$, and a number's $\text{pow}_2$ value uniquely determines the set of distinct elements it can be expressed as the sum of, since if two numbers have the same $\text{pow}_2$ value, their difference is less than half their value, so they cannot both contribute to any sum.

The best way to approach this problem is to use complementary counting. We already know that there are $20 \times 19 \times 18$ ways to choose the 3 officers if we ignore the restriction about Alex and Bob.  So now we want to count the number of ways that both Alex and Bob serve as officers.

For this, we will use constructive counting.  We need to pick an office for Alex, then pick an office for Bob, then put someone in the last office.  We have 3 choices for an office for Alex, either President, VP, or Treasurer.  Once we pick an office for Alex, we have 2 offices left from which to choose an office for Bob.

Once we have both Alex and Bob installed in offices, we have 18 members left in the club to pick from for the remaining vacant office.  So there are $3 \times 2 \times 18$ ways to pick officers such that Alex and Bob are both in an office.  Remember that these are the cases that we want to exclude, so to finish the problem we subtract these cases from the total number of cases.  Hence the answer is: $$ (20 \times 19 \times 18) - (3 \times 2 \times 18) = ((20 \times 19)-6) \times 18 = 374 \times 18 = \boxed{6732}. $$

Extracting Answer from: 
We can solve this problem by finding the total number of ways to fill the three offices and then subtracting the number of ways that Alex and Bob are both officers.

The number of ways to fill the three offices is simply $20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18$, since there are $20$ choices for the first office, $19$ choices for the second office (since one person has already been chosen), and $18$ choices for the third office (since two people have already been chosen).

Now we need to count the number of ways that Alex and Bob are both officers. We can do this by choosing one person to be the third officer (since we know that Alex and Bob cannot be the third officer together) and then counting the number of ways to choose Alex and Bob for the first two offices.

There are $18$ choices for the third officer, since we have already chosen two people to be officers. If we choose Alex for the first office, then there are $19$ choices for the second office (since Bob cannot be chosen), giving us $18 \cdot 19$ ways to fill the first two offices with Alex and Bob. Similarly, if we choose Bob for the first office, then there are $19$ choices for the second office, giving us another $18 \cdot 19$ ways to fill the first two offices with Alex and Bob.

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the offices with Alex and Bob both excluded is $20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 - 2 \cdot 18 \cdot 19 = \boxed{12,\!312}$.

We can first find the total number of ways to choose any two socks out of the 18, which is $\binom{18}{2}=153$. However, this counts pairs of socks with different colors as well as pairs with the same color. 

To count the number of pairs with the same color, we can break it down into cases based on the color of the socks: 

- For white socks, there are $\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to choose a pair. 
- For brown socks, there are $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose a pair. 
- For blue socks, there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose a pair. 

Adding up these cases, we get a total of $28+15+6=49$ pairs with the same color. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{49}$.

To count the number of pairs of integers between 1 and 6 that are relatively prime, we need to count the number of pairs $(a,b)$ such that $\gcd(a,b)=1$. This turns out to be a bit tedious to do by case-work (there are $15$ such pairs), but rather easy to compute by noticing that the probability of a randomly chosen integer being relatively prime to $6$ is $2/3$. This is because there are $2$ possible numbers which are relatively prime to $6$ (namely, $1$ and $5$) and there are $3$ possible numbers in total (namely, $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$). Thus, the probability that a pair of rolls $(a,b)$ yields $\gcd(a,b)=1$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{4}{9}}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
First we choose a suit, which we can do in $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways.  Then there are 13 possibilities for the first card we choose, and once that card is chosen, there are two adjacent cards of the same suit (either card to the left or card to the right), giving us 2 choices (unless we chose the Ace or King, where we only have one choice). After we choose that card, there are still 12 cards of the same suit remaining, so the probability that the second card we choose is one of the adjacent cards is $\frac{2}{12}=\frac{1}{6}$, unless the first card we chose was an Ace or a King, in which case the probability is $\frac{1}{12}$. Finally, after we choose the second card, there is only one card of the same suit remaining, so there is only one card that can come next, giving us a probability of $\frac{1}{11}$.  Therefore, the overall probability is
$$4\cdot 13\cdot \left(\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{11}+\frac{1}{12}\cdot \frac{1}{11}+\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{11}\right)=\boxed{\frac{13}{663}}.$$

We can use a stars and bars argument to solve the problem. We want to distribute 4 balls into 3 boxes, so we can represent the distribution with a string of 4 stars (representing the balls) and 2 bars (representing the dividers between the boxes). For example, the string "**|**|" represents putting 2 balls in the first box, 0 balls in the second box, and 2 balls in the third box.

The number of ways to arrange 4 stars and 2 bars is the same as the number of ways to choose 2 positions for the bars out of 6 total positions. This is ${6 \choose 2} = 15$.

Note that since the boxes are indistinguishable, we are overcounting by a factor of the number of ways to permute the boxes. Since there are 3 boxes, each distribution is counted 3! = 6 times. Therefore, the final answer is $15/6 = \boxed{5}$.

First, let's find the total number of ways to rearrange the letters in BANANA: 

There are 6 letters, so there are 6 choices for the first position, 5 choices for the second position (since one letter has already been used), 4 choices for the third position, and so on. This gives us a total of:

6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720

ways to rearrange the letters in BANANA. 

Now, let's find the number of ways to rearrange the letters such that the new word does not begin with a B. 

If the first letter cannot be B, then there are only 5 choices for the first position (A, N, A, N, A), since one letter has already been used. For the second position, there are 5 remaining letters, so there are 5 choices. For the third position, there are 4 remaining letters, and so on. This gives us a total of: 

5 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 600

We can divide this into cases:

Case 1: Liz chooses the green marble, and not the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (since she won't choose the purple marble). So, there are $\binom{9}{2}=36$ choices in this case.

Case 2: Liz chooses the purple marble, and not the green marble. As in Case 1, Liz must choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles. So, there are $\binom{9}{2}$ choices in this case.

Case 3: Liz chooses neither the green marble nor the purple marble. In this case, Liz must choose three marbles from the nine remaining marbles, and there are $\binom{9}{3}=84$ choices in this case.

The total number of possible choices is $36+36+84=\boxed{156}$.

Alternatively, there are $\binom{11}{3}=165$ ways to select three marbles. Of those, $\binom{9}{1}=9$ ways contain both the purple marble and the green marble. Therefore, there are $165-9=\boxed{156}$ ways to select three marbles such that purple and green marbles are not both chosen.

There are two cases to consider:

Case 1: Liz chooses the green marble but not the purple one.
In this case, Liz has 9 possible marbles to choose from (all the marbles except green and purple). She needs to choose 2 more marbles from this set of 9, so there are $\binom{9}{2} = 36$ ways to do that.

Case 2: Liz chooses the purple marble but not the green one.
This case is exactly the same as Case 1, so there are also 36 ways to choose 3 marbles in this scenario.

Overall, there are $36 + 36 = \boxed{72}$ ways for Liz to choose 3 marbles, given that she cannot choose both the green and purple ones.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by factoring $336$. $336 = 2^4 \cdot 3 \cdot 7.$ Because we are looking for phone numbers, we want four single digits that will multiply to equal $336.$ Notice that $7$ cannot be multiplied by anything, because $7 \cdot 2$ is $14,$ which is already two digits. So, one of our digits is necessarily $7.$  The factor $3$ can be multiplied by at most $2,$ and the highest power of $2$ that we can have is $2^3 = 8.$ Using these observations, it is fairly simple to come up with the following list of groups of digits whose product is $336:$ \begin{align*}
&1, 6, 7, 8\\
&2, 4, 6, 7\\
&2, 3, 7, 8 \\
&3, 4, 4, 7
\end{align*}For the first three groups, there are $4! = 24$ possible rearrangements of the digits. For the last group, $4$ is repeated twice, so we must divide by $2$ to avoid overcounting, so there are $\frac{4!}{2} = 12$ possible rearrangements of the digits. Thus, there are $3 \cdot 24 + 12 = \boxed{84}$ possible phone numbers that can be constructed to have this property.

Extracting Answer from: 
The only requirement for the last three digits is that their product is equal to $7\times 6\times 2\times 4=336$. We know that there are $7$ possible last digits, as we must choose the prime factors of $336$ as the last digits, plus zero. However, we must exclude the cases of two or more zeros. These are $076$, $560$, $650$, and $750$, which we subtract from our total of $7^3$ possibilities. Thus, our answer is $343-4=\boxed{339}$.

Consider the four random points before they are labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, or $D$. In the general case, they will be distinct, forming a convex quadrilateral. Suppose $A$ is labeled. If $B$ is labeled as the vertex opposite $A$, segments $AB$ and $CD$ will intersect; otherwise, they will not. Since there are 3 points to label as $B$, the probability these segments intersect is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$. [asy]

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the length of minor arc $CD$ not containing $A$ or $B$, and let $y$ be the length of minor arc $AB$ not containing $C$ or $D$, as shown below:

[asy]
draw(Circle((0,0),1));
dot((1,0)); label("$B$",(1,0),SE);
dot((0,1)); label("$A$",(0,1),N);
dot((-1,0)); label("$C$",(-1,0),SW);
dot((0,-1)); label("$D$",(0,-1),S);
draw((1,0)--(0,1)--(-1,0)--(0,-1)--cycle,red);
label("$x$",(0.5,0.5),NW,red);
label("$y$",(-0.5,0.5),NE,red);
label("$y$",(-0.5,-0.5),SE,red);
label("$x$",(0.5,-0.5),SW,red);
[/asy]

Then we want $AB$ and $CD$ to intersect, which can only happen if $x+y>180^{\circ}$. Since $x$ and $y$ are symmetric, we can assume without loss of generality that $x\ge y$, and draw the line $x+y=180^\circ$:

[asy]
draw(Circle((0,0),1));
for (int i=0; i<8; ++i) {
  dot(dir(45*i));
}
draw(dir(180)--dir(90),gray(0.7));
draw(dir(-45)--dir(45)--dir(135)--dir(-135)--cycle,red);
[/asy]

The probability that $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is equal to the ratio of the area of the shaded region to the area of the circle. We can compute this area as follows (refer to the diagram below):

[asy]
draw(Circle((0,0),1));
for (int i=0; i<8; ++i) {
  dot(dir(45*i));
}
draw(dir(180)--dir(90),gray(0.7));
draw(dir(-45)--dir(45)--dir(135)--dir(-135)--cycle,red);
fill(arc((-1,0),1,135,180)--cycle,gray(0.7));
fill(arc((0,1),1,225,270)--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw(arc((-1,0),1,135,180),red);
draw(arc((0,1),1,225,270),red);
draw((0,0)--(-1,0)--dir(45)--(0,1)--cycle,red);
label("$x$",(0.5,0.5),NW,red);
label("$y$",(-0.5,0.5),NE,red);
label("$y$",(-0.5,-0.5),SE,red);
label("$x$",(0.5,-0.5),SW,red);
label("$O$",(0,0),SE);
[/asy]

First, we note that the shaded region is symmetric with respect to the line $y=x$, which means that it can be decomposed into quadrants I and III (due to our assumption that $x \ge y$):

[asy]
draw((0,-3)--(0,3),Arrow);
draw((-3,0)--(3,0),Arrow);
fill(arc((-1,0),1,135,180)--cycle,gray(0.7));
fill(arc((0,1),1,225,270)--cycle,gray(0.7));
fill(arc((1,0),1,0,45)--cycle,gray(0.7));
fill(arc((0,-1),1,90,135)--cycle,gray(0.7));
draw(arc((-1,0),1,135,180),red);
draw(arc((0,1),1,225,270),red);
draw(arc((1,0),1,0,45),red);
draw(arc((0,-1),1,90,135),red);
draw((-3,-3)--(3,3),dashed);
draw((-3,3)--(3,-3),dashed);
[/asy]

In quadrant I, both $x$ and $y$ are acute angles, which means that $x+y<90^\circ$ and the shaded area is less than the area of a quarter-circle: $$\frac{1}{4}\cdot\pi r^2<\frac{1}{2}\cdot xy.$$ Simplifying and canceling common factors, we get $$x+y>2\sqrt{2}.$$ In quadrant III, both $x$ and $y$ are obtuse angles, which means that the shaded area is greater than the area of a quarter-circle: $$\frac{1}{4}\cdot\pi r^2<\frac{1}{2}\cdot xy.$$ Simplifying and breaking the inequality into two parts (due to the absolute values), we get $$\begin{aligned} x+y&<\sqrt{2}\cdot\pi r-\sqrt{2}, \\ x+y&>\sqrt{2}\cdot\pi r-2\pi r+\sqrt{2}. \end{aligned}$$ Putting the two cases together gives $$x+y>\sqrt{2}\cdot\pi r-2\sqrt{2}.$$ Finally, since $x+y>180^\circ$, we have $$\sqrt{2}\cdot\pi r-2\sqrt{2}>180^\circ,$$ which simplifies to $$\pi r>90^\circ+2\sqrt{2}.$$ The probability we seek is the ratio of the area above the line $\pi r=90^\circ+2\sqrt{2}$ and the area of the circle $\pi r^2$: $$\frac{\pi-4\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2+\pi/2}}\right)}{\pi}=\boxed{0.2204\dots}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the probability we are looking for and $y$ be the probability that they both spin the same number. By symmetry, it's clear that the probability of Zack getting a larger number than Max does is also equal to $x$. Furthermore, all possible outcomes can be divided into three categories: Max gets a larger number than Zack does, Max and Zack get the same number, or Zack gets a larger number than Max. The sum of the probabilities of these three events is 1, which gives us the equation $x+y+x=1$.

We can calculate $y$ with a little bit of casework. There are four ways in which they can both get the same number: if they both get 1's, both get 2's, both get 3's or both get 4's. The probability of getting a 1 is $\dfrac{1}{2}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 1 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{4}$. Similarly, the probability of getting a 2 is $\dfrac{1}{4}$, so the probability that they will both spin a 2 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{4}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{16}$. The probability of getting a 3 is $\dfrac{1}{6}$, so the probability that they will both get a 3 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{36}$ and the probability that they will both get a 4 is $\left(\dfrac{1}{12}\right)^2=\dfrac{1}{144}$.

To solve the problem, we can use a table to list all possible outcomes of the spins and their probabilities:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Max & Zack & Probability of Max and Zack & Max > Zack \\ \hline
1 & 1 & $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{2}= \frac{1}{4}$ & No \\ \hline
1 & 2 & $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{8}$ & No \\ \hline
1 & 3 & $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{6}= \frac{1}{12}$ & No \\ \hline
1 & 4 & $\frac{1}{2}\cdot \frac{1}{12}= \frac{1}{24}$ & No \\ \hline
2 & 1 & $\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{2}= \frac{1}{8}$ & Yes \\ \hline
2 & 2 & $\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{16}$ & No \\ \hline
2 & 3 & $\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{6}= \frac{1}{24}$ & No \\ \hline
2 & 4 & $\frac{1}{4}\cdot \frac{1}{12}= \frac{1}{48}$ & No \\ \hline
3 & 1 & $\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{2}= \frac{1}{12}$ & Yes \\ \hline
3 & 2 & $\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{24}$ & Yes \\ \hline
3 & 3 & $\frac{1}{6}\cdot \frac{1}{6}= \frac{1}{36}$ & No \\ \hline

4 & 4 & $\frac{1}{12}\cdot \frac{1}{12}= \frac{1}{144}$ & No \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

In the table, the fourth column indicates whether Max gets a larger number than Zack does, and we can calculate the probability of this event by adding up the probabilities in the last column:

$\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{12}+\frac{1}{24}+\frac{1}{24}+\frac{1}{48}+\frac{1}{48}+\frac{1}{72}+\frac{1}{72}+\frac{1}{144}=\boxed{\frac{11}{36}}.$

After Gimli has flipped his coin 2008 times, the probability that he has more heads than Legolas is equal the probability that Legolas has more heads than him. Call this probability $p$. Then there is a $1-2p$ probability that they have the same number of heads. If Gimli already has more heads, he will have more heads after he flips again. If he has fewer heads, he cannot have more after just one more flip. If they are even, there is a $1/2$ chance he will flip another head, and therefore have more heads. In all, Gimli flips more heads than Legolas with probability $p+\frac12(1-2p)=p+\frac12-p=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

GPT File: 4-12-MATH-test-vanilla-answers/test/counting_and_probability/answers/878_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can use complementary counting to find the probability that Legolas gets at least as many heads as Gimli, and subtract that from 1. Let $X$ be the number of heads Legolas gets, and $Y$ be the number of heads Gimli gets. We want to find $P(Y > X)$.

Note that $X$ and $Y$ are both binomial random variables with $n = 2008$ and $n = 2009$ respectively, and $p = 0.5$. We can use symmetry to find $P(X \geq 1004)$, and then subtract from 1.

\begin{align*}
P(X \geq 1004) &= P(X > 1003) \\
&= P(X - 1004 \geq -1) \\
&= P(\frac{X - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} \geq \frac{-1}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}) \\
&= P(Z \geq \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1004}}) \\
&\approx 0.8413
\end{align*}

where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. Similarly, we can find $P(Y \geq 1004)$:

\begin{align*}
P(Y \geq 1004) &= P(Y > 1003) \\
&= P(Y - 1004 \geq -1) \\
&= P(\frac{Y - np}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}} \geq \frac{-1}{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}) \\
&= P(Z \geq \frac{-1}{\sqrt{1004.5}}) \\
&\approx 0.8414
\end{align*}

Therefore, the probability that Gimli flips more heads than Legolas is approximately $1 - 0.8413 \cdot 0.8414 = \boxed{0.2925}$.

We can treat this list as a sequence with a repetitive pattern. We see the sequence repeats itself every 16 elements (from 1 to 9 then back to 2). Because 1000 divided by 16 is 62 with a remainder of 8, to get 1000 terms in this list, we repeat the block 62 times, and then go 8 more elements.  This means that the $1000^{\text{th}}$ integer is the same as the $8^{\text{th}}$ integer, which is $\boxed{8}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Each "cycle" of counting up and down contains $18$ numbers. Therefore, to find the $1000^{\text{th}}$ integer, we must find which cycle the integer is in and where it lies within the cycle. Since $1000$ is not divisible by $18$, we know that the $1000^{\text{th}}$ integer is not the last number in a cycle, and so it must be somewhere in the middle of a cycle.

The largest multiple of $18$ which is less than $1000$ is $972$, which means that the $1000^{\text{th}}$ integer is $1000-972 = 28$ numbers after the final number in the $54^{\text{th}}$ cycle: $$(\ldots, 767, 776, 785, 794, 803, 812, 821, 830, 839, 830, \ldots, \underline{\hphantom{5}821, 812, 803, 794, 785, 776, 767\hphantom{5}}, 776, 785, 794, \ldots).$$ Therefore, the $1000^{\text{th}}$ integer is $\boxed{794}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The first letter must be one of $A$ through $N$ (since $O$ is not allowed), and the second letter must be one of $A$ through the one before the first letter chosen. The first digit must be one of $1$ through $8$ (since $0$ is not allowed), and the second digit must be one of the numbers after the first digit chosen.

Thus there are $14$ choices of first letter, and $13$ choices of second letter.

However, this counts each license plate twice (since we can switch the order of the two letters), so we divide by $2$.

Similarly, there are $8$ choices for the first digit, and $7$ choices for the second digit, so there are $8\cdot 7$ choices for the digits.

Therefore, the total number of license plates is $$\dfrac{14\cdot 13\cdot 8\cdot 7}{2}=\boxed{2548}.$$

There are 7 choices for where to place the bead in position 1, once that bead is placed, there are 3 places that cannot be occupied by the second bead (since they share an edge with the first bead). Therefore, there are 4 options for position 2, and with each placement of bead 2, there are 2 possible locations for bead 3. Two cases arise:

Case 1: The first three beads are not symmetric with respect to a center point. When bead 4 is placed, there is a unique location for bead 5, and there are 2 locations for bead 6. At this point, the final bead is uniquely determined. Thus, there are $7 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 = 56$ non-symmetric configurations of beads.

Case 2: The first three beads are symmetric with respect to a center point. In this case, bead 4 must be placed on one of the three spots located on the symmetry axis. Without loss of generality, assume bead 4 is placed on the spot labeled 2. There is a unique location for bead 5, and only one option for bead 6. There are 2 locations for the final bead. Since there are three spots on the axis of symmetry, there are a total of $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ symmetric configurations of beads.

Thus, the total number of configurations is $56 + 6 = \boxed{62}$.

We count the number of ways that some lane can be left empty, and subtract from the total number, $3^6=729$ because each driver has three choices. Suppose the left-turn lane is left empty. Then each driver is limited to 2 choices, and there are $2^6$ ways to leave the left-turn lane empty. The same logic gives $2^6$ ways to leave the center lane and right-turn lane open. But we have double-counted the situations where two lanes are left empty. Fortunately, since each driver must go into the third lane, there are only 3 situations we have over-counted. This leaves $3\cdot2^6-3=189$ ways to leave at least one lane unoccupied, or $729-189=\boxed{540}$ ways to occupy every lane.

There are 6 choices for the first car, 3 choices for the lane it can take, and 5 choices for the second car (it cannot occupy the same lane as the first car). Similarly, there are 4 choices for the third car, 3 choices for the fourth car, 2 choices for the fifth car, and only one choice for the last car.

The beads will all be red at the end of the third draw precisely when two  green beads are chosen in the three draws. If the first bead drawn is  green, then there will be one  green and three red beads in the bag before the second draw. So the probability that  green beads are drawn in the first two draws is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{8}.
$$ The probability that a  green bead is chosen, then a red bead, and then a  green bead, is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{32}.
$$ Finally, the probability that a red bead is chosen then two  green beads is $$
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}.
$$ The sum of these probabilities is $$
\frac{1}{8}+ \frac{3}{32}+ \frac{1}{16}= \boxed{\frac{9}{32}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $P_0$, $G_0$ denote the event that the bag has zero, one green bead, respectively, in the bag initially. Let $R_n$, $P_n$, $G_n$ denote the event that the bag has all-red, one-purple-one-red, two-green-one-red beads after $n\ge 0$ draws. We notice that
\begin{align*} P(R_3) &= P(R_3\cap P_0)+P(R_3\cap G_0) \\ &= P(R_2\cap P_0\cap R_1)+P(G_1\cap R_2\cap P_0)+P(R_2\cap G_0\cap R_1)+P(P_1\cap R_2\cap G_0) \\ &=P(R_2\cap P_0\cap R_1)+P(P_1\cap R_2\cap G_0)\end{align*}

Let $R_n$, $P_n$, $G_n$ denote the event that the bag has $3-n$, one-purple-one-red, and $n$ green beads respectively after $n\ge 0$ draws. We notice that $R_n$ can be reached from $R_{n-1}$, $P_{n-1}$ can be reached from $R_{n-1}$ or $P_{n-1}$, and $G_n$ can be reached from $G_{n-1}$ or $P_{n-1}$, and the initiating states of the beads have probability 1 of occurring respectively. Then we have
\[P(R_3) = P(R_3|P_2)P(P_2)+P(R_3|R_2)P(R_2) = P(G_1|R_2)P(R_2)+P(R_3|R_2)P(R_2)\]Since there are no red beads initially, so the probability of $P_2$ is $(1/2)^2=1/4$.  Also,
\begin{align*} P(R_2) &=P(R_2|P_1)P(P_1)+P(R_2|G_1)P(G_1)\\ &=P(R_2|P_1)P(P_1)+P(R_2|P_1)P(P_1\cap G_1)+P(R_2|G_1)P(G_1\cap P_1)+P(R_2|G_1)P(G_1\cap G_1)\\ &=2P(R_2|P_1)P(P_1)\end{align*}
We now compute $P(R_2|P_1)$ the probability of the bag having $2$ red, $0$ green beads after $1$ draw with one purple bead. This equals 
\[P(R_2|P_1)=(1/2)(1/2)+(1/2)(1/2) = 1/2\]
as one purple and one red bead are added in these branches with probability $1/2$ each.  Thus, $P(R_2) = 2(1/2)(1/2)(1/2)=1/4$.
Note that we have $P(R_3|R_2) = 1$ and need $P(G_1|R_2)$.  We can get to $G_1$ from $R_1$ and $P_1$.  Therefore,
\[P(G_1|R_2)=P(G_1|R_1)(1/2)+P(G_1|P_1)(1/2)\]We find that $P(G_1|R_1)=1$ since we add a green bead with probability 1/2. Also, for $P(G_1|P_1)$, we can only replace the purple one with a green one. Thus, $P(G_1|P_1)=(1/2)$.  Hence, $P(G_1|R_2)= (1/2)(1)+(1/2)(1/2) = 3/4$, we have $P(R_3) = (3/4)\cdot(1/4)+(1/4)\cdot(1) = \boxed{\frac{5}{16}}$.
Remark
It may also be possible to compute this using a state diagram combining any two states of $R_n$, $P_n$, and $G_n$ and then computing the steady state.

Case 1: The first step is up. Then there are two steps remaining, both of which must be to the right. There is only one way to take two steps to the right, so there is only $\boxed{1}$ path that starts with an up step.

Case 2: The first step is to the right. Then there are two steps remaining, both of which must be up. There is only one way to take two steps up, so there is only $\boxed{1}$ path that starts with a right step.

First we'll count the number of ways to choose the three positions without any restrictions, which is simply $8 \times 7 \times 6$. Now we'll count the number of ways where either all positions are held by boys or all positions are held by girls. If all positions are held by boys, we have $4$ options for the President, $3$ options for the Vice-President, and $2$ options for the Treasurer, for a total of $4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$ ways. Similarly, if all positions are held by girls, we have $4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24$ ways. However, we've now double counted the case where all positions are held by one gender, so we need to subtract it out. There are $4$ boys and $4$ girls, so there are $2^4 - 2 = 14$ ways to choose only boys or girls for the three positions. Thus, the total number of valid ways to choose the positions is $8 \times 7 \times 6 - 2 \times 24 + 14 = \boxed{458}$.

The only one-digit integer divisible by $4$ that we can construct is $4$.

We can construct $3$ two-digit integers divisible by $4$: $12$, $32$, and $24$.

An integer is divisible by $4$ if its rightmost two digits are divisible by $4$.  Thus we can append either or both of the remaining two digits to any of these two-digit integers and preserve divisibility by $4$.  For each, there are $2$ ways to choose one digit to append, and $2$ ways to order the digits if we append both of them.  Thus we get $4$ more integers for each, or $12$ total.

We can solve this problem systematically by considering the possible last two digits of the integer. Since the integer needs to be divisible by 4, the last two digits must be a multiple of 4. 

Case 1: The integer ends in 12. In this case, the only other digit that can be used is 3. Therefore, we can form the integer 123.

Case 2: The integer ends in 24. In this case, the only other digit that can be used is 1. Therefore, we can form the integers 124 and 314.

Case 3: The integer ends in 32. In this case, the only other digit that can be used is 4. Therefore, we can form the integer 432.

Case 4: The integer ends in 44. In this case, the only other digit that can be used is 1. Therefore, we can form the integer 144.

Therefore, we can form a total of $\boxed{5}$ different positive integers that are divisible by 4 using each of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 at most once, and no other digits.

The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product.

Let $x$ be number of people wearing all three items.  Since 30 people are wearing bathing suits and sunglasses, we know that $30 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and sunglasses.  Similarly, $25 - x$ are wearing just bathing suits and hats, while $40 - x$ are wearing just sunglasses and a hat.

To find the number of people wearing just sunglasses, we subtract the people who are wearing sunglasses with other items from the total number of people wearing sunglasses, which is $110 - (30 - x) - (40 - x) - x = 40 + x$.  Similarly, the number of people wearing just hats is $30 + x$, while the number of people wearing just bathing suits is $15 + x$.

Since the total number of people on the beach is 190, and everyone is wearing one of the items, we have: \begin{align*}
190 &= (15 + x) + (40 + x) + (30 + x) \\
&\qquad+ (25 - x ) + (30 - x) + (40 - x) + x\\
&= 180 + x.
\end{align*} We can then solve for $x$, so the number of people on the beach wearing all three items is $x = \boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to solve this problem. We start by adding up the number of people wearing each item separately: 
$$110 + 70 + 95 = 275$$
However, this overcounts the number of people since some are wearing two or three items. To correct for this, we need to subtract the people wearing two items, and then add back in the people wearing all three items. 

If we subtract the number of people wearing two items, we get: 
$$275 - (30 + 25 + 40) = 180$$
The 30, 25, and 40 are the overlap between pairs of items. 

So now we have counted everyone who is wearing one item or two items, but we have not counted those who are wearing all three. To include these people, we add back in the number of people wearing all three items: 
$$180 + \text{number of people wearing all three items}$$
We know that the total number of people on the beach is 190, so to find the number of people wearing all three items, we set up the equation: 
$$180 + \text{number of people wearing all three items} = 190$$
Solving for the number of people wearing all three items, we get: 
$$\text{number of people wearing all three items} = 190 - 180 = 10$$
Therefore, there are 10 people wearing all three items (sunglasses, bathing suit, and hat).

Extracting Answer from: 
The number of zeros at the end of a number is equivalent to the number of factors of 10 that number has. Since there are more factors of 2 than there are of 5 in a factorial, this is determined by the number of factors of 5. So, we go about computing this for each factorial separately.

To count the number of zeroes at the end of $100!$, we must count the number of factors of 5 in the product.  There are $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5}\right\rfloor$ multiples of 5 from 1 to 100. (The notation $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ means the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, so basically, $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5}\right\rfloor$ means "divide 100 by 5 and round down.")  This gives us 20 multiples of 5.  But the multiples of 25 contribute an additional factor of 5, so we have to add in the total number of multiples of 25, which gives us a total number of factors of 5 of $\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{100}{25} \right\rfloor = 20+ 4 = 24$.

Similarly, for $200!$ the contributed zeros total $\left\lfloor \frac{200}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{200}{125} \right\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$; and for $300!$, $\left\lfloor \frac{300}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{300}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{300}{125} \right\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 = 74$. So, our answer is $24 + 49 + 74 = \boxed{147}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The number of zeros at the end of an integer is equal to the highest power of 10 that divides the integer. Since 10 = 2 × 5, the number of zeros in the product of three factorials is determined by the number of factors of 5 that appear. We can count the number of multiples of 5 among the numbers in the factorials using the formula $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{5}\right\rfloor$ (the greatest integer less than or equal to $\frac{n}{5}$).

Using this formula, we find that there are $\left\lfloor\frac{100}{5}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{100}{25}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{100}{125}\right\rfloor = 20 + 4 + 0 = 24$ factors of 5 in 100!.

Similarly, there are $\left\lfloor\frac{200}{5}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{200}{25}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{200}{125}\right\rfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49$ factors of 5 in 200!, and $\left\lfloor\frac{300}{5}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{300}{25}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{300}{125}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{300}{625}\right\rfloor = 60 + 12 + 2 + 0 = 74$ factors of 5 in 300!.

Therefore, the total number of factors of 5 among the three factorials is $24+49+74 = 147$, which means that the product ends in $\boxed{147}$ zeros.

The $n$th row of Pascal's triangle has $2^{n-1}$ odd numbers. So, if a row has no odd entries other than $1$, then it has exactly one $1$. Thus we want a row that includes an even number. But the $n$th row has $k$ even numbers, where $k$ is the number of ones in the binary representation of $n$. Therefore we need to count how many $n$ have one binary digit set (since that digit will be a $1$ in the row) and at least one additional binary digit set (since that will add an even number of zeros). The former count is just the number of positive integers less than $100$ that are powers of $2$, or $6$. The latter count is just $2^{7}-2^{1}-6=122$, which is the number of $n$ having $2$ or more distinct binary digits set. Thus there are $6+122=128$ rows that meet the conditions.

All whole numbers can be written as $4k$, $4k+1$, $4k+2$, or $4k+3$ for some integer $k$. Suppose we look at the smaller of the two consecutive numbers. If it is of the form $4k$, it is a multiple of 4. If it is of the form $4k+3$, the other is $4k+4$, a multiple of 4. If on the other hand, it can be written as $4k+1$ or $4k+2$, neither number is a multiple of 4. So in two of the four equally likely cases, one of the numbers is a multiple of 4, for a probability of $2/4=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

We can do this problem using complementary counting, meaning we find the probability that neither number is a multiple of 4 and subtract from 1. 

There are $2\cdot5=10$ possible pairs of consecutive integers from 1 to 10. Out of these pairs, 2, 6, and 10 are the only numbers that are multiples of 4, which means there are 3 pairs where both numbers are multiples of 4. Therefore, there are $10-3=7$ pairs of consecutive integers where neither number is a multiple of 4. 

Therefore, the probability that neither number is a multiple of 4 is $\frac{7}{10}$, and the probability that at least one number is a multiple of 4 is $1-\frac{7}{10}=\boxed{\frac{3}{10}}$.

In all, disregarding the gender rule, there are $$\binom{12}4\binom84=\frac{12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7\cdot6\cdot5}{4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot4\cdot3\cdot2}=34650$$ways of assigning the teams. We will count the number of ways a team can have all boys or all girls and subtract from this total.

There are 2 choices for the violating gender and 3 choices for the violating color. Once these are picked, there are $\binom64=15$ ways to choose the violating team, and $\binom84=70$ ways to pick the other two teams, for a total of $2\cdot3\cdot15\cdot70=6300$ ways to choose a violating team. However, this procedure double-counts the assignments that make one team all girls and another all boys. There are 3 choices for the girls team and then 2 choices for the boys team, and $\binom64^2=225$ ways to choose the teams, for a total of $2\cdot3\cdot225=1350$ double-counted arrangements, leaving $6300-1350=4950$ ways to make a team all girls or all boys.

There are 3 jerseys of each color. Let's organize the jerseys by color and assign them to the 3 teams. Then we will worry about which team goes to which group of students.

There are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose which color jersey each team will wear. There are $\binom{12}{4}$ ways to choose which 4 students will wear the first color jersey, $\binom{8}{4}$ ways to choose which 4 of the remaining 8 students will wear the second color jersey, and $\binom{4}{4}$ ways to choose which 4 of the remaining 4 students (all of the opposite gender) will wear the third color jersey. So that's a total of $\binom{3}{1}\binom{12}{4}\binom{8}{4}\binom{4}{4}$ ways to assign the jerseys.

But we've overcounted because we didn't specify which team wears which color jersey. There are $3!=6$ ways to assign the colors to the teams. So the final answer is $$6\binom{3}{1}\binom{12}{4}\binom{8}{4}\binom{4}{4}=\boxed{3,\!105,\!024}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We will use linearity of expectation.  Let $X_i$ be the indicator variable for the event that the $i$th card is between the two jokers, for $i=1,2,\ldots,52$.  If the two jokers are in positions $a < b$ for $a,b\in\{1,2,\ldots,54\}$, then we have
\[X_i = \begin{cases} 1 &\quad\text{if $a < i < b$}\\ 0 &\quad\text{otherwise.} \end{cases}\]
The number of cards between the two jokers is $Y=b-a-1$, which satisfies $0\le Y\le 52$.  Using linearity of expectation, we find
\begin{align*}
E(Y) &= E(b-a-1) \\
&= E(b-a)-1 \\
&= E\left[\sum_{i=a+1}^{b-1} 1\right]-1 \\
&= \sum_{i=a+1}^{b-1} E(1)-1 \\
&= \sum_{i=a+1}^{b-1} P(\text{card $i$ is between the jokers})-1 \\
&= \sum_{i=a+1}^{b-1} \frac{1}{b-a-1}-1 \\
&= \frac{b-a-2}{b-a-1}.
\end{align*}
Note that $\frac{b-a-2}{b-a-1}$ is not well-defined unless $b-a>1$, but in that case, the above derivation holds.  We need to account for all possible pairs of indices $(a,b)$ such that $a<b$ and $b-a>1$.  There are $\binom{54}{2}$ ways to choose two distinct indices, but we must subtract $\binom{52}{2}$ since we do not want to include pairs that include both jokers.  Thus, there are $\binom{54}{2}-\binom{52}{2}=2016$ valid pairs $(a,b)$ to consider.  The probability that the two jokers are in positions $a$ and $b$ is $\frac{1}{\binom{54}{2}}$, so the expected value of $Y$ is
\begin{align*}
E(Y)&= \frac{1}{\binom{54}{2}}\sum_{\substack{1\le a<b\le 54\\b-a>1}}\frac{b-a-2}{b-a-1} \\
&= \frac{1}{\binom{54}{2}}\sum_{d=2}^{52}\sum_{b=a+d}^{54}\frac{d-2}{d-1} \\
&= \frac{1}{\binom{54}{2}}\sum_{d=2}^{52}(53-d)\cdot(d-2) \\
&= \frac{1}{\binom{54}{2}}\cdot\frac{50\cdot 51\cdot 48}{3} \\

If $a \geq 4$, then $a^3+b^2+c>a^3\geq 4^3>50$. But we want $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, so we must have $a=2$.  Now we substitute $a=2$ into $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, which gives $b^2+c\leq 42$. Since $b^2<42$, we know that $b$ must be one of 2, 4, or 6.

When $b=2,$ $c\leq 38$. There are 19 even positive integers less than or equal to 38, namely $2\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $\ldots$, $2\times 19$.

Notice that the cube of an even number is divisible by $8$. Therefore, $a^3 \ge 8$, and $a \ge 2$. We can set up a table of values of $a^3$.

\begin{align*}
a = 2 &\quad \Rightarrow \quad a^3 = 8 \\
a = 4 &\quad \Rightarrow \quad a^3 = 64 \\
a = 6 &\quad \Rightarrow \quad a^3 = 216 \\
a = 8 &\quad \Rightarrow \quad a^3 = 512
\end{align*}

We will do casework on $a = 2$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. 

If $a = 2$, then we want to find the number of ordered pairs $(b,c)$ of even positive integers that satisfy $8 + b^2 + c \leq 50$. Rearranging, we see that $b^2 + c \leq 42$. It follows that there are $10$ possible values of $b$, with $b \leq 6$, and there are $22$ possible values of $c$, with $c \leq 40$. Therefore, for $a = 2$, there are $10 \cdot 22 = 220$ solutions.

If $a = 4$, then we want $64 + b^2 + c \leq 50$, which gives the absurd inequality $b^2 \leq -14$. There are no solutions for $a = 4$.

If $a = 6$, then we want $216 + b^2 + c \leq 50$, which gives the absurd inequality $b^2 \leq -166$. There are no solutions for $a = 6$.

If $a = 8$, then we want $512 + b^2 + c \leq 50$, which gives the absurd inequality $b^2 \leq -462$. There are no solutions for $a = 8$. 

Putting our cases together, there are $220 + 0 + 0 + 0 = \boxed{220}$ solutions.

We have $9^3=729$, $9^4=6561$, and $9^5=59049$. A multiple of $9^3$ can be expressed in the form $729n$, where $n$ is an integer. We want to count the number of integers $n$ such that $729n$ is greater than $6561$ and less than $59049$. Dividing both sides of $729n>6561$ by $729$ gives $n>9$, and dividing both sides of $729n<59049$ by $729$ gives $n<81$. Therefore, there are $81-9=\boxed{72}$ integers $n$ that satisfy both inequalities.

The easiest approach is to consider how many times 8 can appear in the units place, how many times in the tens place, and how many times in the hundreds place.  If we put a 8 in the units place, there are 10 choices for the tens place and 10 choices for the hundreds place (including having no hundreds digit) for a total of $10\times10=100$ options, which means that 8 will appear in the ones place 100 times. (If we choose the hundreds place to be equal to 0, we can just think of that as either a two digit or a one digit number.) Likewise, if we put an 8 in the tens place, there are 10 choices for the units place and 10 choices for the hundreds place for a total of 100 options and 100 appearances of 8 in the tens place. Finally, if we put a 8 in the hundreds place, we have 10 options for the units place and 10 options for the tens place for another 100 options and 100 appearances of 8. Since $100 + 100+100=300$, there will be a total of $\boxed{300}$ appearances of 8.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can count the number of times the digit 8 appears in the ones place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.

In the ones place, there are 10 numbers that end in 8: 8, 18, 28, $\ldots$, 998. So the digit 8 appears in the ones place 10 times.

In the tens place, there are 100 numbers with 8 as the digit: 80, 81, 82, $\ldots$, 88, 89, 180, 181, $\ldots$, 188, 189, $\ldots$, 980, 981, $\ldots$, 988, 989. So the digit 8 appears in the tens place 100 times.

In the hundreds place, there are 1000 numbers with 8 as the digit: 800, 801, 802, $\ldots$, 898, 899. So the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place 1000 times.

Therefore, the digit 8 appears $10 + 100 + 1000 = \boxed{1110}$ times.

There are a total of 13 members on the committee, so the probability of choosing any member to be on the subcommittee is 1/13. 

To choose a subcommittee consisting of three Republicans, we need to choose 3 Republicans out of the 5 total Republicans. We can do this using combinations: 

${5 \choose 3} = \dfrac{5!}{3!2!} = 10$ 

There are 10 ways to choose a subcommittee consisting of three Republicans. 

The total number of ways to choose a subcommittee of 3 members is: 

${13 \choose 3} = \dfrac{13!}{3!10!} = 286$

There are $3^6=729$ possible arrangements of the six plants. To count the arrangements that satisfy the given conditions, we split into cases:

Case 1: Exactly four of the plants are aloe plants.
There are $\binom{6}{4}=15$ ways to choose which four plants will be aloe plants. For each of these arrangements, the other two plants can be either basil or violet, so we have $2^2=4$ choices for each of the 15 arrangements. Therefore, there are $15 \cdot 4 = 60$ arrangements that satisfy this case.

Case 2: Exactly five of the plants are basil plants.
There are $\binom{6}{5}=6$ ways to choose which five plants will be basil plants. For each of these arrangements, the other plant can be either aloe or violet, so we have $2$ choices for each of the 6 arrangements. Therefore, there are $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ arrangements that satisfy this case.

There are a total of 52 choices for the first card, and the probability that it is an ace is $\dfrac{4}{52}$. There are then only 3 aces remaining out of 51 cards for the second pick, so the probability that the second card is an ace given that the first card was an ace is $\dfrac{3}{51}$. Therefore, the probability that the top two cards are both aces is \[
\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}=\boxed{\frac{1}{221}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can start by selecting the first digit. Since it must be between 1 and 9, inclusive, we have 9 choices. 

Once we select the first digit, we can only choose digits that are strictly smaller. If we pick $d$ as our first digit, then we can only choose digits from 0 to $d-1$, inclusive, for the second digit. Similarly, for the third digit, we can only choose digits from 0 to whatever digit we picked for the second digit.

Therefore, the number of 3-digit descending numbers is equal to the sum of the number of choices for each possible first digit:

\begin{align*}
\text{Number of descending numbers} &= 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 \\
&= \frac{(9)(10)}{2} \\
&= \boxed{45}.
\end{align*}

In general, the number of $n$-digit descending numbers is:

$$\frac{9(10)}{2} \cdot \frac{8(9)}{2} \cdots \frac{(11-n)(10-n)}{2}$$

This formula comes from multiplying together the number of choices for each digit, using the same reasoning as above. Note that the formula only works for $n \leq 10$. For larger values of $n$, some of the products in the formula become 0.

There are four possible ways for the cubes to land: two red faces up, the first with a red face and the second with a white face up, the first with a white face and the second with a red face up, and two white faces up. So, there are two ways that the cubes can land such that there is a red face up and a white face up. The probability that we get a red face up is $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the probability that we get a white face up is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the cubes land such that there is one red face and one white face up is $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Alternate solution: After you roll the first cube, the second one must be the other color, which occurs with probability $\frac{3}{6} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can approach this problem by considering all the possible outcomes when rolling the two cubes. Each cube has six faces, and there are 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes when rolling the two cubes together.

We can list all of these outcomes using an ordered pair (r, w), where r represents the number of red faces that land face up on the first cube, and w represents the number of white faces that land face up on the second cube. For example, (2, 4) represents the outcome where the first cube lands with two red faces up, and the second cube lands with four white faces up.

Using this method, we can count the number of outcomes where one red face and one white face are up. There are two ways this can happen: either the first cube has one red face up and the second cube has one white face up, or the first cube has one white face up and the second cube has one red face up. Each of these outcomes can happen in three different ways (depending on which face is up), so there are a total of 2 x 3 x 3 = 18 outcomes where one red face and one white face are up.

Therefore, the probability of this happening is 18/36 = 1/2 (or 50%).

There are $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for Ryan to arrange the lamps, and $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways for him to choose which lamps are on, giving $20\cdot20=400$ total possible outcomes. There are two cases for the desired outcomes: either the left lamp is on, or it isn't. If the left lamp is on, there are $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are on, and $\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways to choose which other lamps are red. This gives $10\cdot10=100$ possibilities. If the first lamp isn't on, there are $\binom{5}{3}=10$ ways to choose which lamps are on, and since both the leftmost lamp and the leftmost lit lamp must be red, there are $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which other lamp is red.

First, let's find the total number of ways to arrange the 6 lava lamps on the shelf. This is simply 6!, which equals 720.

Next, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the lamps and have the leftmost lamp be red. This is the same as the number of ways to arrange the remaining 5 lamps, which is 5!. However, we need to multiply this by 3, since there are 3 red lamps that could be in the leftmost position. So the total number of ways to arrange the lamps with a red lamp in the leftmost position is 3*5! = 360.

Finally, we need to consider the number of ways to turn on the lamps such that the leftmost lamp that is turned on is red. If we assume that the leftmost red lamp is turned on, then there are 2 more red lamps that could be turned on, out of a total of 5 lamps remaining. The number of ways to choose 2 lamps out of 5 is 5 choose 2, which equals 10. Then we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the 3 lamps that are turned on. This is simply 3!, which equals 6. So there are a total of 10*6 = 60 ways to arrange and turn on the lamps such that the leftmost lamp that is turned on is red.

Putting it all together, the probability that the leftmost lamp on the shelf is red, and the leftmost lamp which is turned on is also red, is:

60/720 = 1/12

Therefore, the probability is 1/12.

We want to find the area of the set of points which also satisfies $x^2+y^2\le 4$.  The set of ordered pairs that satisfy this inequality is a circle with radius $2$ centered at the origin.

draw ((-2,0)--(2,0));
draw ((0,-2)--(0,2));

The probability that $(A,B)$ lands in this shaded region is the finite area of the shaded region divided by the total area of the square, $4.$ The area of this region can be calculated in several ways, using triangle areas, sector areas or polar integration. We'll give a simple integration method here.

For the quarter circle with center $(0,0)$ and radius 2, we are going to integrate over the part of the circle in the first quadrant, which is described by
\[x^2+y^2 \le 4\qquad\text{and}\qquad x\ge 0\qquad\text{and}\qquad y\ge 0.\]So we need to calculate the following double integral:
\begin{align*}
\int_0^2 \int_0^{\sqrt{4-x^2}} dy\,dx &= \int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^2 r \cos \theta \cdot r\,dr\,d\theta \\ &= \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos \theta \cdot \frac{2^3}{3}\,d\theta \\ &= \frac{4}{3} \cdot \left[\sin \theta\right]_0^{\pi/2} \\ &= \frac{4}{3}.
\end{align*}

Since the total area is $4$, the probability that $(A,B)$ falls inside of the shaded area is $\boxed{\frac{\pi}{3}}.$

There are $\binom{9}{2}=36$ pairs of points in $S$, and each pair determines a line. However, there are three horizontal, three vertical, and two diagonal lines that pass through three points of $S$, and these lines are each determined by three different pairs of points in $S$. Thus the number of distinct lines is $36 - 2 \cdot 8= \boxed{20}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can graph all nine points (excluding $(0,0)$ since that's unhelpful to us) to find that they form a square with dots on its vertices and dots on the midpoint of each side. Thus, any line that connects two of these points must pass through the midpoint of a side of the square.

Lines through adjacent vertices of the square pass through two dots; lines through opposite vertices of the square pass through four dots; lines through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side pass through three dots (the vertex, the midpoint closest to the vertex, and the midpoint closest to the side the vertex is opposite of).

There are $8$ lines through adjacent vertices, $2$ lines through opposite vertices, and $8$ vertices. There are $4$ sides per vertex, and each side can contribute one line, so lines through vertices contribute $32$ lines. There are $4$ midpoints per side, and each pair of midpoints on the same side can contribute one line, so lines through midpoints contribute $8$ lines.

Our final answer is $8 + 2 + 32 + 8 = \boxed{50}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are a total of 6 letters in the word CIRCLE. To find the number of ways to arrange them, we can use the formula for permutations:

$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$

where $n$ is the total number of objects and $r$ is the number of objects taken at a time.

In this case, we have $n=6$ and $r=6$, since we are arranging all 6 letters. Substituting into the formula, we get:

$$P(6,6) = \frac{6!}{(6-6)!} = \frac{6!}{0!} = 6! = 720$$

Therefore, there are 720 ways to arrange the letters in the word CIRCLE.

Note that 9 divides any factorial greater than or equal to $9!$. To count the factorials from $1!$ to $8!$, note that $9 = 3^2$ divides $6!$ and so does $3$. In general, $3$ divides $n!$ if and only if $n$ has a 3 in its decimal representation, so there are $\left\lfloor\frac{99}{10}\right\rfloor + 1 = 10$ factorials from $9!$ to $100!$.

Let's use a Venn diagram with three circles, with $A$ in the left circle, $B$ in the right circle, and $C$ in the middle. We can begin to fill in the diagram using the given information:

[asy]
label("$A$",(0,0));
label("$B$",(4,0));
label("$C$",(2,-1.8));
draw(circle((0,0),1.5));
draw(circle((4,0),1.5));

label("$?$",(2.6,0.6));
label("$7$",(2,-0.5));
label("$13$",(3.45,-0.95));
label("$3$",(1,1));
[/asy]

Since there are exactly 20 items in $A$, we label the overlapping region between $A$ and $B$ with $20-10=10.$

Now we know that the total number of items in $A$ and $B$ is $20$, and the number of items in $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $7$. We can use inclusion-exclusion to fill in more of the diagram. The number of items in $A$ and $B$ is $$|A\cap B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cup B|=20+|B|-13=|B|+7.$$The number of items in $B$ and $C$ is $$|B\cap C|=|B|+|C|-|B\cup C|=|B|+7-13=|B|-6.$$Putting it all together, we have:

We can simplify the expression inside the parentheses using the formula for combinations, ${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Writing $7!$ using this formula, we get:

So we have

$$2\left(\frac{7!}{3!4!}\right) = 2{7\choose3}$$

Using the formula for combinations again, we get:

$${7\choose3} = \frac{7!}{3!4!} = \frac{7\cdot6\cdot5}{3\cdot2\cdot1} = 35$$

Extracting Answer from: 
To solve this problem, we can first find the probability of getting exactly 0 or 1 head, and then subtract it from 1 to get the probability of getting at least 2 heads.

The probability of getting exactly 0 head is 1/2^6 = 1/64, since there are 2 possible outcomes (heads or tails) for each of the 6 coins, and they are all independent.

The probability of getting exactly 1 head is 6/2^6 = 6/64, since there are 6 ways to choose which coin will be the head, and the others will be tails.

Therefore, the probability of getting at least 2 heads is:

1 - 1/64 - 6/64 = 57/64

So the answer is 57/64, or approximately 0.891.

If each person shakes hands with exactly one other person, then there will be $\frac{23 \cdot 1}{2}$ handshakes, since two people are required to complete a handshake. This is equal to 11.5 handshakes, which is clearly impossible. We can achieve 12 handshakes by forming two rows of 11 and 12 people. Each person in the first row shakes hands a different person in the second row. This will give eleven handshakes. The leftover person must shake hands with someone, giving $\boxed{12}$ handshakes total.

From the M, we can proceed to four different As. Note that the letters are all symmetric, so we can simply count one case (say, that of moving from M to the bottom A) and then multiply by four.

From the bottom A, we can proceed to any one of three Ts. From the two Ts to the sides of the A, we can proceed to one of two Hs. From the T that is below the A, we can proceed to one of three Hs. Thus, this case yields $2 \cdot 2 + 3 = 7$ paths.

Thus, there are $4 \cdot 7 = \boxed{28}$ distinct paths.

Extracting Answer from: 
We use recursion to count the paths. Let $a_n$ be the number of paths of length $n$ that end at $A$, $t_n$ be the number of paths of length $n$ that end at $T$, and $h_n$ be the number of paths of length $n$ that end at $H$. Note that $a_1=0$, $t_1=4$, and $h_1=0$. Then, we have the following relations:
\begin{align*} a_n &= t_{n-1} \\ t_n &= a_{n-1} + h_{n-1} + 2t_{n-1} \\ h_n &= t_{n-1} \end{align*}
The first relation comes from the fact that to reach $A$, the previous step must have been a $T$. The second relation comes from the fact that to reach $T$, the previous step must have been either an $A$, a $T$, or an $H$. Finally, the third relation comes from the fact that to reach $H$, the previous step must have been a $T$. Using these relations, we can compute $a_{12}$, $t_{12}$, and $h_{12}$, which represent the number of paths of length 12 that end at $A$, $T$, and $H$, respectively. Since we must end at $H$, the total number of paths is $h_{12}=\boxed{512}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first count the number of integers from $1$ to $799$ that do not contain the digit $6$. It is easy to show that there are $8\cdot9^2=648$ such integers, since there are $8$ choices for the first digit (since $0$ cannot be chosen), and $9$ choices for each of the second and third digits.
Now, we count the number of integers from $600$ to $799$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice. To do this, we can use complementary counting. The number of integers from $600$ to $799$ that do not contain the digit $6$ is $2\cdot3\cdot9=54$. Since there are $200$ integers from $600$ to $799$, there are $200-54=146$ integers from $600$ to $799$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice.
Therefore, the total number of integers from $1$ to $800$ that contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $2\cdot 146 = \boxed{292}$.

There are $\binom{4}{3}=4$ ways to choose the three cards. 

In order for the product of the numbers on those cards to be zero, at least one of the cards must have a $0$ on it. 

There is only $1$ card with $0$ on it, so there is only $1$ way to choose $0$ and $2$ other cards from the remaining $3$. 

Otherwise, none of the cards have $0$ on them. In this case, each card must have either $2$ or $1$ zeros. 

There is only $1$ card with two zeros on it, so there are $\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose $2$ zeros and $1$ other card from the remaining $3$. 

Otherwise, there are $3$ cards with $1$ zero on them. We can choose $1$ zero in $\binom{3}{1}=3$ ways, and one of the remaining $2$ cards in $\binom{2}{1}=2$ ways. This gives a total of $3\cdot 2=6$ ways to choose $1$ zero and $2$ other cards from the remaining $3$.

Extracting Answer from: 
A number is a multiple of $11$ if and only if the sum of its first, third, fifth, etc. digits subtracted by the sum of its second, fourth, sixth, etc. digits is a multiple of 11.  (This may be proved using the factorization $10\equiv -1\pmod{11}$).  Thus the three-digit multiples of 11 are 110, 121, 132, $\ldots$, 990.  To find the number of these integers, we first take out the factor of 11 to obtain 10, 11, 12, $\ldots$, 90.  This is an arithmetic sequence.  The number of terms in the sequence is equal to $90-10=80$, and the common difference is equal to 1.  If we divide both endpoints by 11, we get the sequence 1, 10/11, 12/11, $\ldots$, 90/11.  We want to count the number of integers in this sequence, which is the same as the number of integers in the sequence 11, 12, 13, $\ldots$, 81.  This has $81-11+1=\boxed{71}$ terms.

Extracting Answer from: 
For $a$ and $b$ to satisfy the given condition, $c$ must either be an integer, in which case $A+B=C$, or it must lie strictly between two consecutive integers, in which case $A+B=C-1$ or $A+B=C+1$.  We will break the solution up into four cases and add up the probabilities.

Case 1: $c$ is an integer.  In order for $A+B=C$, we need $a$ and $b$ to be integers themselves, which has probability $1/4$.  Once we know this, $c$ is determined, so this case has probability $1/4$.

Case 2: $c$ is of the form $n+\frac{1}{2}$, where $n$ is an integer.  For this case, we need one of $a$ or $b$ to be of the form $n+\frac{1}{4}$ and the other to be of the form $n+\frac{3}{4}$.  The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$, since a number is of the form $n+\frac{1}{4}$ or $n+\frac{3}{4}$ with probability $\frac{1}{2}$.  Since there are two choices for $n$, this case has probability $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Case 3: $c$ is of the form $n+\frac{3}{2}$, where $n$ is an integer.  This case is similar to Case 2.

Case 4: $c$ is strictly between two consecutive integers.  The only way for $A+B=C$ in this case is if $a$ and $b$ round to opposite integers, which happens with probability $\frac{1}{2}$.  Once again, since $c$ is then determined, this case has probability $\frac{1}{4}$.

Adding up the probabilities for the four cases, we have a total probability of $\frac{1}{4} + 2\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + \frac{1}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.
