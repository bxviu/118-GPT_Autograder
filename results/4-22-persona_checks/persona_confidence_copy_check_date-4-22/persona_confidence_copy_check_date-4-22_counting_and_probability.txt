Extracting Answer from: 
Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\begin{aligned}{{47}\over{288}}&=
4\left({1\over6}\right)^2+2\left({1\over6}+x\right)
\left({1\over6}-x\right)\cr&=
{4\over36}+2\left({1\over36}-x^2\right)\cr&=
{1\over6}-2x^2.\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\boxed{29}$.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/counting_and_probability/1003_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
The notation $P(X=x)$ denotes the probability that $X$ takes the value $x.$

We will use states. Let $p_F=P(\text{current die ends showing }F)$ and let $p_{NF}=P(\text{current die ends showing a face other than }F).$ Without loss of generality, we assume $F=1,$ which means the number on the opposite face is 6. Now set up a system of equations using law of total probability and summing over the possible states (i.e. which die is being rolled), taking a cue from the condition that the sum of the faces is 7. 

First we note that the probability of each die being chosen is 1/2 as they are indistinguishable. Then we have  \begin{align*}
P(\text{sum is 7}) &= P(\text{die 1 shows 1})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 6})\cdot p_{NF} + P(\text{die 1 shows 6})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 1})\cdot p_{NF} \\
&\qquad +P(\text{die 1 shows 1})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 5})\cdot p_{NF} + P(\text{die 1 shows 5})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 1})\cdot p_{NF} \\
&\qquad+P(\text{die 1 shows 2})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 5})\cdot p_F + P(\text{die 1 shows 5})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 2})\cdot p_F \\
&\qquad+P(\text{die 1 shows 2})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 4})\cdot p_F + P(\text{die 1 shows 4})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 2})\cdot p_F \\
&\qquad+P(\text{die 1 shows 3})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 4})\cdot p_{NF} + P(\text{die 1 shows 4})\cdot P(\text{die 2 shows 3})\cdot p_{NF}.
\end{align*} From this, we obtain $p_F=\frac{3}{8},$ the probability that we initially roll the "biased" die.

Since $\frac{2005}{3} = 668\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{4} = 501\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{12} = 167\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.

Every multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)

To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. 

First, we will find the number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are multiples of 3 or 4. 

Multiples of 3: There are a total of 2005/3 = 668 integers between 1 and 2005 that are multiples of 3.

Multiples of 4: There are a total of 2005/4 = 501 integers between 1 and 2005 that are multiples of 4.

However, we have counted some numbers twice, specifically those that are multiples of both 3 and 4 (i.e. multiples of 12). 

Multiples of 12: There are a total of 2005/12 = 167 integers between 1 and 2005 that are multiples of 12.

To get the final answer, we need to subtract the number of multiples of 12 that we counted twice. Therefore, the total number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12 is:

668 + 501 - 167 = 1002 

Therefore, there are 1002 numbers between 1 and 2005 that are integer multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $6\times 6 = 36$ possible rolls, each of which is equally likely.  We approach the problem by computing the probability that the larger of the two numbers rolled is equal to $n$, where $n$ ranges from 1 to 6.

First, suppose that we roll a $6$.  Then the only way that the larger number can be 6 is if the other die also shows a $6$.   Therefore, we get $\frac{1}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{36}$ probability that the larger number is $6$.

Next, suppose we roll a $5$.  Then the larger number is $5$ only if the other die is equal to 5 or 6, giving a probability of $\frac{2}{6}\cdot\frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{18}$.

Proceeding this way, we see that the probability that the larger number is equal to $n$, $1\leq n\leq 6$, is equal to $\frac{n^2-(n-1)^2}{36}=\frac{2n-1}{36}$, since $n$ can appear either as the larger or the smaller number.  We thus have the expected value of the larger number rolled to be $$\begin{aligned} \frac{1}{36}\left(1\cdot2+3\cdot\frac{3}{2}+5\cdot\frac{5}{2}+7\cdot\frac{7}{2}+9\cdot\frac{9}{2}+11\cdot\frac{11}{2}\right) &=\frac{1}{36}(2+9+25+49+81+121) \\ &=\frac{287}{36}. \end{aligned}$$Therefore, the expected value of the larger of the two numbers rolled is $\boxed{\frac{287}{36}}$.

The sum of the three integers on the drawn balls is 15 minus the sum of the integers on the two balls that were left behind.  Therefore, we are looking for the probability that the two balls that were left behind sum to an even number.  There are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose these two balls.  Their sum is even only if they are both even or both odd.  The probability they are both even is $\frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that they are both odd is $\frac{3}{10}$.

There are two cases where the sum of three integers is odd: either we draw three odd integers or we draw two even and one odd integer. 

Case 1: Three odd integers

There are three odd integers and two even integers, so to choose three odd integers, we have $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ option. The probability of choosing three odd integers is therefore $\dfrac{1}{\binom{5}{3}} = \dfrac{1}{10}$.

Case 2: Two even integers and one odd integer

There are three odd integers and two even integers, so to choose two even integers and one odd integer, we need to choose 2 even integers from the 2 even integers and 1 odd integer from the 3 odd integers. We have $\binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{3}{1} = 3$ options. The probability of choosing two even integers and one odd integer is therefore $\dfrac{3}{\binom{5}{3}} = \dfrac{3}{10}$.

The probability of drawing three balls with odd sum is the sum of the probabilities from Case 1 and Case 2: 

$\dfrac{1}{10} + \dfrac{3}{10} = \boxed{\dfrac{2}{5}}$.

We tackle the problem using complementary counting.  There are $\binom{24}{8}$ ways to arrange the 8 math books, 8 history books, and 8 physics books without any restrictions.  Of these, the number of arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent math books is the number of ways to arrange 7 math books and 8 other books, which is $\binom{15}{7}$.  Similarly, there are $\binom{15}{7}$ arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent history books and $\binom{15}{7}$ arrangements with at least one pair of adjacent physics books.  However, we've counted arrangements with two adjacent forbidden types twice, so we need to subtract the number of arrangements with two adjacent forbidden types.  There are 3 types of pairs of forbidden adjacent books.  Each pair has 6 remaining books to arrange, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  Thus we need to subtract $3\cdot 6!$ from our count of allowed arrangements.  However, we have subtracted the arrangements with all three types of forbidden adjacent books three times and added them back three times, so we need to add $\binom{3}{1}\cdot 5!$ to our count.  This gives us a total of $$\binom{24}{8} - 3\binom{15}{7} + 3\cdot 5!.$$ Evaluating this expression confirms that the answer is $\boxed{229,752}$.

The only way in which there won't be two dice displaying the same number is if exactly one number between 1 and 6 isn't being displayed on any of the dice and the 5 dice all display different numbers. There are 6 different possibilities for the number that isn't being displayed, and then there are a total of $5!$ ways in which the 5 dice displaying different numbers can be arranged, so there are a total of $6\cdot5!$ outcomes that result in the dice all displaying different numbers. Since each of the 5 dice can have 6 results when rolled and all of the rolls are determined independently, there are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\dfrac{6\cdot5!}{6^5}=\dfrac{5}{54}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\dfrac{5}{54}=\boxed{\dfrac{49}{54}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The easiest way to approach this problem would be to calculate the probability of the complement event (i.e. the probability that no two dice show the same number) and then subtract it from 1.

If the first die shows any number, the probability that the second die shows a different number is 5/6 (since there are 5 remaining numbers out of 6 that it could show). Similarly, the probability that the third die shows a different number from the first two is 4/6 (since there are now 4 remaining numbers out of 6). Continuing in this way, we can see that the probability that all 5 dice show different numbers is:

(5/6) x (4/6) x (3/6) x (2/6) x (1/6) = 5!/6^5

Therefore, the probability that at least two dice show the same number is:

1 - 5!/6^5 = 1 - 0.598 = 0.402 (rounded to three decimal places)

So the probability that at least two dice show the same number is approximately 0.402 or 40.2%.

To get a constant term, the exponents of $x$ must cancel.  If we take the term with 2 $x^3$'s and 3 $\frac{1}{x^2}$'s, then they will cancel.

Extracting Answer from: 
Consider a square of side length two on the grid containing the point $(0,0)$. We can form this square from the four unit squares adjacent to $(0,0)$. We've overcounted such squares, because there exist four other unit squares that form a square of side length 2 containing the point $(1,1)$. Thus, of the $n-1$ rows of the grid containing unit squares, there are $n-3$ squares of side length 2 in each. So, there are $4(n-3)$ such squares. The number of smaller squares is simply the number of unit squares on the grid, $3n$. Finally, there is one more larger square of side length $n$ containing all other squares. So, $$4(n-3) + 3n + 1 = 70 \Longrightarrow n = \boxed{10}.$$

To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ such $n$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $*(n) = \{a,b,c,d\}$ where $a < b < c < d$.

If $d > 2n$, then the third element of $*(n)$ cannot be realized. If $c > n+2$, then the second element cannot be realized. If $b < n-2$, then the first element cannot be realized. Since the second condition requires that $b$ be either $n-1$ or $n$, we split into cases based on what $b$ is.

If $b = n-1$, then $*(n) = \{n-3, n+2, 2n, \frac{n}{2}\}$. If $\frac{n}{2} < n-3$, then the first element cannot be realized. If $2n > n+2$, then the second element cannot be realized. If $n+2 > 2n$, then the third element cannot be realized. Thus, $\frac{n}{2} < n-3 < n+2 < 2n$. If $n \leq 6$, then $\frac{n}{2} < n-3 < n+2 < 2n \leq 12$, which cannot hold. If $n > 9$, then $\frac{n}{2} > n-3 > n+2 > 2n$, which cannot hold. The only remaining possibility is $n=7$, which gives $\{4,9,14,3\}$.

If $b = n$, then $*(n) = \{n-2, n+2, 2n, \frac{n}{2}\}$. If $\frac{n}{2} < n-2$, then the first element cannot be realized. If $2n > n+2$, then the second element cannot be realized. If $n+2 > 2n$, then the third element cannot be realized. Thus, $\frac{n}{2} < n-2 < n+2 < 2n$. If $n \leq 5$, then $\frac{n}{2} < n-2 < n+2 < 2n \leq 10$, which cannot hold. If $n > 8$, then $\frac{n}{2} > n-2 > n+2 > 2n$, which cannot hold. The only remaining possibility is $n=6$, which gives $\{4,8,12,3\}$.

To begin, consider the number of ways to arrange the three countries around the circle.  We can consider the English representatives a block, the Germans another block, and the French a third block.  There are $(3-1)!=2$ ways to arrange these three blocks around a circle.  We can also see this by simply drawing the two possible arrangements: [asy]

label("F",(-.75,-1));
label("G",(.75,-1));

[/asy] Within the English group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the three representatives.  Similarly, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Germans and $2!$ ways to arrange the French representatives.

Thank you for your confidence in me! 

First we can consider the arrangements of representatives who sit together. 

The three representatives from England can sit together in $3!$ ways. The four representatives from Germany can also sit together in $4!$ ways. The two representatives from France can sit together in $2!$ ways. 

Now we need to consider the arrangement of the sets of representatives. There are 3 ways to arrange the sets of representatives, namely England, Germany, France or Germany, France, England or France, England, Germany. 

If we consider the sets of representatives to be distinct, we can arrange them around the circular table in $3!$ ways. If we consider the sets of representatives to be indistinct, each arrangement is counted three times, so we need to divide by 3. 

Putting everything together, the total number of ways is 

$$
\frac{3! \times 4! \times 2! \times 3!}{3} = \boxed{1728}

Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\frac{5}{9}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $6^3 = 216$ possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Let's count the outcomes where at least two of the dice match. 

Case 1: All three dice match. There are six ways for this to happen: $(1,1,1)$, $(2,2,2)$, $(3,3,3)$, $(4,4,4)$, $(5,5,5)$, and $(6,6,6)$.

Case 2: Exactly two of the dice match. There are ${3 \choose 2} = 3$ ways to choose which two dice match, and for each choice there are six options for the value of the matching dice and five options for the value of the non-matching die. So there are $3 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 90$ outcomes in this case.

Adding up the outcomes from the two cases, we have $6+90=96$ outcomes where at least two of the dice match. Thus, the probability of rolling at least two matching dice is $\dfrac{96}{216} = \boxed{\dfrac{4}{9}}$.

Since we only want to count integer points in the interior, we can just count integer points on the boundary and subtract from the total number of integer points in the rectangle. The rectangle has $9 \cdot 7 = 63$ integer points, because it spans $9$ units in the $x$-direction and $8$ units in the $y$-direction.

There are $5 - (-5) + 1 = 11$ integer values of $x$ and $4 - (-4) + 1 = 9$ integer values of $y$ that are contained in the rectangle. But, since we counted the vertices twice $(\pm 4, \pm 5)$ and $(\pm 5, \pm 4)$, we must subtract $4$ from $11+9=20$ to obtain the number of integer points on the boundary. Therefore, there are $16$ integer points in the interior, that is, $63 - 16 = \boxed{47}$ integer points are strictly in the interior.

If we draw two circles in the plane, they can intersect at most two points. Similarly, if we draw three circles, each pair can intersect at most two points, giving a total of at most six points. However, if we draw a fourth circle, it can intersect each of the first three circles in two points, for a total of six new points of intersection. Thus, the maximum number of points of intersection is $2+2+2+6=\boxed{12}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two ways in which the sum of the numbers obtained will be odd:

1. If the first die shows an odd number and the second die shows an even number.
2. If the first die shows an even number and the second die shows an odd number.

For the first case, the probability of the first die showing an odd number is 1/2 (since there are three odd numbers and three even numbers on the first die), and the probability of the second die showing an even number is also 1/2 (since there are three even numbers and three odd numbers on the second die). So the probability of the sum being odd in this case is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

Similarly, for the second case, the probability of the first die showing an even number is also 1/2, and the probability of the second die showing an odd number is also 1/2. So the probability of the sum being odd in this case is also 1/4.

Therefore, the total probability of the sum being odd is:

1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2

So the probability of the sum being odd is 1/2.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, let's find out the probability of getting a 6 on any given roll. Since the die is fair, there is 1/6 probability of rolling a 6.

Now, we can use the binomial distribution to find the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls. Let X be the random variable representing the number of 6's rolled. Then:

P(X ≤ 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)

P(X = 0) = (5 choose 0)(1/6)^0(5/6)^5 = 5/6^5 ≈ 0.4019
P(X = 1) = (5 choose 1)(1/6)^1(5/6)^4 = 5/6^4 ≈ 0.2679
P(X = 2) = (5 choose 2)(1/6)^2(5/6)^3 = 10/6^5 ≈ 0.0595

Therefore,

P(X ≤ 2) = 0.4019 + 0.2679 + 0.0595 = 0.7294

So, the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the 5 rolls is approximately 0.7294 or 72.94%.

The expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.

To obtain $x^2y^2$ from the expansion of the first term, we need to choose two factors of $x+y$ that contribute an $x$ and two factors that contribute a $y.$ We can choose the factors that contribute an $x$ in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways and the factors that contribute a $y$ in the same number of ways. Thus, the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the first term is $\binom{4}{2}\binom{4}{2}=36.$

Similarly, to obtain $x^2y^2$ from the expansion of the second term, we need to choose two factors of $x+2y$ that contribute an $x$ and two factors that contribute a $y.$ We can choose the factors that contribute an $x$ in $\binom{4}{2}$ ways and the factors that contribute a $y$ in the same number of ways.

There are a couple of different ways you could approach this problem, but one common method is to use subtraction. First, we need to figure out how many total rows there are in the Misty Moon Amphitheater. We know that rows 12 through 22 are reserved for the youth club, so we can subtract those rows from the total to find the number of rows that are available for other groups:

Total rows = 22 (the last reserved row) - 11 (the first reserved row) + 1 (to include row 22) 
Total rows = 12 

Now we can multiply the number of available rows by the number of seats per row to find the total number of available seats:

Total seats = 12 rows x 33 seats per row 
Total seats = 396 

Finally, we can subtract the total number of seats from the number of reserved seats to find the number of seats that are reserved for the youth club:

Reserved seats = 22 rows x 33 seats per row 
Reserved seats = 726 

Youth club seats = Reserved seats - Total seats 
Youth club seats = 726 - 396 
Youth club seats = 330 

Therefore, there are 330 seats reserved for the youth club in rows 12 through 22 of the Misty Moon Amphitheater.

There are $5!$ ways to arrange 5 beads in a line.  Since there are 5 rotations in a circle for each of these arrangements, we must divide by 5, and since there are two matching reflections for each arrangement, we must divide by 2.  So there are $\dfrac{5!}{5 \times 2} = \boxed{12}$ ways.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Fix one of the beads as a starting point.
2. Arrange the other 4 beads in a line next to the fixed bead (there are 4! = 24 ways to do this).
3. Since rotations are not treated as different arrangements, we need to divide by 5 to account for the 5 possible starting points.
4. Since flips are also not treated as different arrangements, we need to divide by 2 to account for the fact that each arrangement can be flipped.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place 5 different beads on a bracelet is:

(4! / 5) / 2 = 12.

If 6 is one of the visible faces, the product will be divisible by 6.  If 6 is not visible, the product of the visible faces will be $1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120$, which is also divisible by 6.  Because the product is always divisible by 6, the probability is $\boxed{1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We could solve this problem using complementary probability. First, let's find the probability that the product of the five visible faces is not divisible by 6. To not be divisible by 6, the product must be an odd number or a multiple of 3 but not a multiple of 6. The probability of the first die resulting in an odd number is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$ (there are three odd numbers and six numbers in total). Similarly, the probability of each of the other four dice resulting in an odd number is also $\frac{1}{2}$, so the probability that all five dice result in odd numbers is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5=\frac{1}{32}$. 

Now, let's consider the case where the product is divisible by 3 but not 6. The only way this can happen is if exactly one of the five visible faces is a 2 or a 4 (other than the face that is not visible). The probability of the first die resulting in a 2 or a 4 is $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$. Similarly, the probability of each of the other four dice resulting in an odd number or a number that is not 2 or 4 (which are not divisible by 3) is $\frac{2}{3}$, so the probability that exactly one of the five visible faces is a 2 or a 4 is $\binom{5}{1}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^4=\frac{40}{243}$.

Finally, let's consider the case where the product is divisible by 2 and 3 (which means it is divisible by 6). This can happen in three ways: (1) two of the visible faces are even and the other three are odd, (2) one of the visible faces is a 2 and the other four are odd, or (3) one of the visible faces is a 4 and the other four are odd. The probability of the first case is $\binom{5}{2}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\frac{5}{16}$. The probability of the second case is $\binom{5}{1}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4=\frac{5}{48}$. The probability of the third case is the same as the second case, so the total probability of the product being divisible by 6 is $\frac{5}{16}+\frac{5}{48}+\frac{5}{48}=\frac{35}{96}$.

Therefore, the probability that the product of the visible faces is divisible by 6 is $1-\left(\frac{1}{32}+\frac{40}{243}\right)=\frac{643}{729}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are six outcomes when you roll a die.  Three of them are prime:  2, 3, and 5.  Therefore, there are also three composite numbers:  1, 4, and 6.  The probability of rolling a composite number is 3/6 since there are three ways out of six to do so.  To determine the probability of rolling a composite number on both dice, multiply the probabilities of each outcome together:  $$\frac{3}{6} \cdot \frac{3}{6}=\frac{9}{36}.$$ Simplifying the fraction, we get $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

Let $x$ be the probability that a 1 is rolled.  Then the probability that a 2 is rolled is $2x$, the probability that a 3 is rolled is $3x$, and so on.  Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{21}(1) + \frac{2}{21}(2) + \cdots + \frac{6}{21}(6) = \frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots 6^2}{21} = \boxed{\frac{13}{3}}. \]

The probability of rolling a 1 is $p$, the probability of rolling a 2 is $2p$, and so forth, where $p$ is a constant.  We calculate $p$ by summing probabilities:

\[1\cdot p + 2\cdot 2p + 3 \cdot 3p + 4\cdot 4p + 5\cdot 5p + 6\cdot 6p = 1.\]Solving for $p$, we get $p = \frac{1}{91}.$

The expected value of a single roll is  \[\frac{1}{91}(1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) = \boxed{\frac{69}{91}}.\]

Answer from Original: 23

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/counting_and_probability/512_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
To find the answer, we can start by calculating the total value of Steve's coins:

- 1 quarter is worth 25 cents.
- 2 nickels are worth 10 cents.
- 3 pennies are worth 3 cents.

Therefore, Steve has a total of 25 + 10 + 3 = 38 cents.

Now, we can think about how many different-priced items Steve could buy with exactly 38 cents. One way to do this is to list all the possible prices, starting from 1 cent and going up to 38 cents, and check which ones Steve can pay for with his coins.

However, there is a quicker way to solve this problem. We can notice that Steve can always pay for any item that costs a multiple of 1 cent (because he has pennies), any item that costs a multiple of 5 cents (because he has nickels), and any item that costs a multiple of 25 cents (because he has a quarter). Therefore, we just need to find how many different-priced items there are that satisfy at least one of these conditions.

- Multiples of 1 cent: There are 38 different prices that are multiples of 1 cent, from 1 cent to 38 cents.
- Multiples of 5 cents: There are 7 different prices that are multiples of 5 cents, from 5 cents to 35 cents (inclusive), with a step of 5 cents.
- Multiples of 25 cents: There is only 1 price that is a multiple of 25 cents, which is 25 cents.

However, we are not done yet, because some of these prices may overlap. For example, 5 cents is both a multiple of 1 cent and a multiple of 5 cents. To avoid double-counting, we need to subtract the number of prices that are multiples of both 1 cent and 5 cents, which are the multiples of 5 cents (because they were already counted). Similarly, we need to subtract the number of prices that are multiples of both 1 cent and 25 cents, which is the multiple of 25 cents (because it was already counted). Finally, we need to subtract the number of prices that are multiples of both 5 cents and 25 cents, which is 0 (because there is no price that satisfies both conditions).

Therefore, the final answer is:

- 38 + 7 + 1 - 7 - 1 - 0 = 38

Steve can individually pay for 38 different-priced items with exact change.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping the two coins is the same, we need to count the number of ways that both coins can land heads the same number of times and divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.

There are five possible outcomes for the number of heads from flipping three coins: 0, 1, 2, or 3. There are also five possible outcomes for the number of heads from flipping four coins: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We can chart these outcomes in a table as follows:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
\hline
Coin A & 1 & 3 & 3 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
Coin B & 1 & 4 & 6 & 4 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

To find the total number of outcomes, we multiply the number of outcomes for each coin:

$${3\choose 0}\cdot{2^{3}}\cdot{4\choose 0}\cdot{2^{4}} = 2^7 \cdot 2^4 = 2^{11}.$$

So, the probability that the number of heads obtained from flipping the two coins is the same is:

$$\frac{1\cdot1 + 3\cdot4 + 3\cdot6 + 1\cdot4 + 0\cdot1}{2^{11}} = \frac{32}{2048} = \boxed{\frac{1}{64}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
The word "MISSISSIPPI" has 11 letters, with four S's, four I's, two P's, and one M.

To start, let us count the number of ways to arrange all 11 letters without any restrictions. This can be done using the permutation formula:

P(11,11) = 11!

Next, we need to consider the repeated letters. There are 4 S's, so we need to divide the total number of arrangements by 4! (the number of arrangements for the S's). Similarly, there are 4 I's, so we need to divide by 4! as well. For the 2 P's, we divide by 2! (the number of arrangements for the P's).

Therefore, the number of unique arrangements of the letters in MISSISSIPPI is:

11! / (4! * 4! * 2!) = 34,650.

The probability that the first card is a $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{13}{52}$. Given that the first card is a $\heartsuit$, the probability that the second card is also a $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{12}{51}$ (since there are now only 51 cards left in the deck, and 12 of those are $\heartsuit$s). Finally, given that the first two cards are $\heartsuit$s, the probability that the third card is also a $\heartsuit$ is $\dfrac{11}{50}$.

So the probability that all three cards are $\heartsuit$s is: $$\dfrac{13}{52} \cdot \dfrac{12}{51} \cdot \dfrac{11}{50} = \dfrac{11}{850}\approx 0.013$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Notice that the product of the two dice is greater than the sum of the two dice if and only if $(a-1)(b-1)>1$ where $a,b$ are the faces that come up.  This inequality becomes \[a+b>ab.\] We could use a truth table to compute the probability, but instead, we can use complementary counting.  The probability that $a+b \leq ab$ is easier to compute.  If $a=1$, then the inequality holds for all $b=1,2,3,\dots,8$; if $a=2$, then the inequality holds when $b=1$; if $a=3$, then the inequality holds for $b=1$ or $b =2$; if $a=4$, then the inequality holds for $b=1,2,$ or $b=3$; if $a=5,$ the inequality holds for $b=1,2,3,$ or $b=4,$ and so on up to the case $a=8$, when the inequality holds for all $b < 8$.  Thus, there are $1+1+2+3+\dots+7 = 28$ ways in which $a+b \leq ab$.  Therefore, the probability that $a+b \leq ab$ is $\frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}$.  Since the two events partition $1$, the probability that $a+b > ab$ is $1-\frac{7}{16} = \boxed{\frac{9}{16}}$.

Let's call the first digit x and the final digit y. We know that x = 3y.

Since the number is a 3-digit number, we know that x cannot be 0 or 1.

For x = 3, y can be any digit from 1 to 3 (since the final digit cannot be 0). So there are 3 possibilities for y.

For x = 6, y can be any digit from 2 to 6. So there are 5 possibilities for y.

For x = 9, y can be any digit from 3 to 9. So there are 7 possibilities for y.

Therefore, the total number of 3-digit numbers that satisfy the condition is 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Extracting Answer from: 
To form a triangle on a unit cube, we need to choose 3 distinct vertices from the 8 corners. Therefore, there are $\binom{8}{3}=56$ possible triangles we can form using the corners of the unit cube.

However, not all of these triangles are non-congruent. There are several ways we can have congruent triangles:

1. Reflections: If we reflect a triangle about a face, an edge or a vertex of the cube, we get a congruent triangle. There are 7 possible reflections (3 face, 3 edge and 1 vertex).
2. Rotations: If we rotate a triangle about an axis passing through the centroid, we get a congruent triangle. There are 3 possible axes passing through the centroid of a triangle.
3. Combinations of reflections and rotations: We can also apply a combination of reflections and rotations to a triangle to get a congruent triangle.

Now, we need to count the number of non-congruent triangles. We can do this by dividing the total number of triangles by the number of congruence classes:

$$\text{Number of non-congruent triangles}=\frac{\text{Number of total triangles}}{\text{Number of congruence classes}}=\frac{56}{7}=8.$$

Therefore, there are 8 non-congruent triangles that can be formed using the corners of a unit cube.

Extracting Answer from: 
To solve this problem, we can use a method called "stars and bars". Imagine placing the 5 identical balls in a line. We can then place 1 "divider" between the balls to represent the separation between the two boxes. For example, if we place the divider between the 2nd and 3rd ball, the first box will contain 2 balls and the second box will contain 3 balls.

We have a total of 6 items (5 balls and 1 divider), and we need to choose the position of the divider. This can be done in 5 ways, since we have 5 spaces between the 5 balls where we can place the divider:

 _B_B_B_B_ 

where "B" represents a ball and "_" represents a possible location for the divider.

However, we need to divide by 2 to correct for overcounting, since the boxes are indistinguishable. This gives us:

5/2 = 2.5

But since we cannot have a fraction of ways, we round up to the nearest whole number. So there are 3 ways to put 5 balls in 2 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes.

We begin by considering when $ab$ is negative. This is only possible if one of $a$ or $b$ is negative and the other is positive. The ratios of the lengths of the intervals $-3 \le a \le 0$ and $0 \le a \le 1$ are $\frac{3}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$, respectively. Similarly, the ratios of the lengths of the intervals $-2 \le b \le 0$ and $0 \le b \le 4$ are $\frac{2}{6}$ and $\frac{4}{6}$, respectively.

Therefore, the probability that $ab$ is negative is $$\left(\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{4}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{3}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{4}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}.$$ Since the probability that $ab$ is nonzero is $1$, the probability that $ab$ is positive is $$1-\frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$$

In general, \[(a+b)^3=a^3+3a^2b+3ab^2+b^3\]

Consider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$. From this, we find that the greatest integer less than this quantity is $\boxed{1092}$.

We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can find the probability of the complement event and then subtract from 1. The complement event is that Mike draws a card from at most two of the four suits. We can split this into two cases:

Case 1: Mike draws cards from only one suit. There are $\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose the suit, and then $\binom{13}{5}$ ways to choose the cards from that suit.
Case 2: Mike draws cards from exactly two suits. There are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose the suits, and then $\binom{26}{5}$ ways to choose the cards (since we need to draw 5 cards from 26 remaining cards after choosing 10 cards from 2 of the 4 suits).

Hence, the total number of ways to draw at most two suits is $\binom{13}{5} + 4\cdot\binom{26}{5}$. The total number of ways to draw any 5 cards is $\binom{52}{5}$. Therefore, the desired probability is:

$$1-\frac{\binom{13}{5}+4\cdot\binom{26}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}=\frac{5291}{16660}.$$

Therefore, the probability that Mike draws a card from at least three of the four suits is $\boxed{\frac{5291}{16660}}$.

26 x 25 x 10 x 9 = 58,500. 

So there are 58,500 different license plates that can be formed if every license plate has 2 different letters (A through Z) followed by 2 different one digit (0-9) numbers.

There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \[ E = \frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\frac{1}{2}. \] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\boxed{k = 15}$.

The expected loss for playing the game is equal to the probability of drawing a black ball, multiplied by $-1$, plus the probability of drawing a white ball, multiplied by $1$.  Suppose that the probability of drawing a black ball is $p$, so the probability of drawing a white ball is $1-p$.  Then the expected loss is equal to $-p+(1-p)\cdot 1=1-2p$, in dollars.  We are given that this expected loss is $0.50$, so $1-2p=0.50$, which implies that $p=0.25$.  Since the probability of drawing a black ball is $\frac{k}{5+k}$, we have $\frac{k}{5+k}=0.25$, or $k= \boxed{5}$.

The product of two integers is even unless both of the integers are odd.  Therefore, the only pair of integers from the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ whose product is odd is $\{1,3\}$.  Since there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ pairs, the probability of drawing $\{1,3\}$ is $\frac{1}{6}$.  So the probability of drawing two numbers whose product is even is $1-\dfrac{1}{6}=\boxed{\dfrac{5}{6}}$.

We can use complementary counting. The only way that two numbers multiplied together would be odd is if they were both odd (odd x odd = odd). There is exactly $1$ way to choose $2$ odd numbers out of the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, $(3,1)$ or $(3,2)$. Since there are ${4\choose2}=6$ ways to select two numbers without restriction, the probability that two randomly selected numbers, with replacement, yield an odd product is $\frac{1}{6}$. Thus, the probability of getting an even product is $1 - \frac{1}{6} = \boxed{\frac{5}{6}}$.

There is a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that a person will order a meat brat, a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a hot dog, and a $\frac{1}{3}$ probability that they will order a veggie brat. We can choose which two people we want to order meat brats in $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways, and then we want the other two to order hot dogs. Once we've set who we want to order what, there is a $\left( \frac{1}{3} \right) ^4=\frac{1}{81}$ probability that they all actually order what we want them to. Therefore, the probability that two people order meat brats and the other two hot dogs is $6\cdot \frac{1}{81}=\boxed{\frac{2}{27}}$.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/counting_and_probability/759_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are 4 people, and we are choosing 2 to order meat brats and 2 to order hot dogs. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways we can arrange the 4 people in a particular order when ordering their brats or hot dogs, which is 3^4 = 81 since each person has 3 choices.

To calculate the number of ways 2 people can order meat brats and 2 people can order hot dogs, we need to choose 2 people out of 4 to order meat brats. There are 4 choose 2 ways to do this, which is 6. Once we have chosen the 2 people to order meat brats, the other 2 people must order hot dogs.

The number of ways to order 2 meat brats and 2 hot dogs is then 6.

The probability is the number of ways to order 2 meat brats and 2 hot dogs divided by the total number of outcomes, which is:

6/81 = 2/27

Therefore, the probability that 2 of them order a meat brat, and the other two order hot dogs is 2/27.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start with a small number of vertices and work our way up. 

For 1 vertex, there are 0 triangles. 

For 2 vertices, there are 0 triangles. 

For 3 vertices, there are 2 triangles. 

For 4 vertices, there are 5 triangles. 

For 5 vertices, there are 9 triangles. 

It looks like the number of triangles increases by a consecutive odd number each time a vertex is added. This makes sense because each new vertex adds new triangles to the figure. Specifically, the new vertex adds a triangle to every pair of adjacent vertices. 

Using this pattern, we see that we need to find the sum of the first $n-2$ odd integers starting from 1, and then add 1 (for the triangle with all the vertices). We can express this as:

$1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-5) + (2n-3) + 1$

This is equal to:

$(1+1) + (3+5) + (7+9) + ... + [(2n-7)+(2n-5)]+(2n-3)$

which simplifies to:

$2 + 8 + 16 + ... + 2n^2 - 10n + 8$

We can factor out a 2 to get:

$2(1+4+8+...+n^2-5n+4)$

Now we need to find the sum of the squares of the first $n$ positive integers:

$1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$

Plugging in $n-2$ gives:

$(n-2)(n-1)(2n-3)/6$

We can simplify this to:

$(n^3 - 6n^2 + 11n - 6)/6$

Substituting this back into our original expression gives:

$2(n^3-6n^2+11n-6)/6$

$n^3-6n^2+11n-6$

Factoring, we get:

$(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)$

Since we want the value of $n$, we need to choose the solution that is greater than 3. Therefore, $n=\boxed{4}$.

There are four ways in which Dora can first leave point $A$, and two cases for her third move: either it is toward $A$, in which case her fourth move must be away from $A$; or it is toward some other vertex of the square, in which case her fourth move must be back toward $A$. We consider these two cases separately, letting $p$ denote the probability that Dora walks completely around the square given that her third move is toward $A$, and $q$ denote the probability that she walks completely around the square given that her third move takes her to a vertex of the square other than $A$. We seek $1/4(p+q)$.

The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\text{both red}) = P(\text{1st red}) \times P(\text{2nd red \textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{4}{10}\times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\text{both blue}) = P(\text{1st blue}) \times P(\text{2nd blue \textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both blue}) = \frac{6}{10}\times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \begin{align*}P(\text{both same color}) &= P(\text{both red}) + P(\text{both blue}) \\ &= \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{ \frac{7}{15}}. \end{align*}

To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of selecting two red marbles or two blue marbles.

The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10, since there are 4 red marbles out of 10 total. After the first draw, there are 9 marbles left, 3 of which are red. Therefore, the probability of selecting a red marble on the second draw, given that the first marble was red, is 3/9. So the probability of selecting two red marbles is:

(4/10) x (3/9) = 2/15

Similarly, the probability of selecting a blue marble on the first draw is 6/10, and the probability of selecting another blue marble on the second draw is 5/9. So the probability of selecting two blue marbles is:

(6/10) x (5/9) = 1/3

Finally, we add the probabilities of selecting two red marbles and two blue marbles:

2/15 + 1/3 = 1/3

Therefore, the probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is 1/3.

If $\sqrt{a+\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\leq a \leq 10$, $1\leq c\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, note that $\sqrt{a + \sqrt{b}}$ must be greater than or equal to $1$, so $a+\sqrt{b}$ must be a perfect square between $1$ and $100$. Let $c^2 = a + \sqrt{b}$ for some integer $c \geq 1$, so we have $c^2 = a + \sqrt{b}$. Rearranging gives $\sqrt{b} = c^2-a$, so $c^4 - 2ac^2 + a^2 - b = 0$.

Since we want $\sqrt{b}$ to be an integer, $c^4 - 2ac^2 + a^2 - b$ must be a perfect square. We will consider values in the range $1 \le a \le 10$ and $1 \le b \le 36$.

Plugging in $b = 1$, we get $(c^2-a-1)(c^2-a+1) = 1$. Since $c^2$ is always greater than $a$, we have $c^2 - a + 1 > c^2 - a - 1 > 0$, so we must have $c^2 - a +1 = 1$ and $c^2 - a - 1 = 1$ for $c=2$ and $a=3$. This works since $\sqrt{3+\sqrt{1}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$.

Plugging in $b = 2$, we get $(c^2-a-2)(c^2-a+2) = 4$. If we try $c = 1$, then we get $a = 1$, but this does not work since $\sqrt{1+\sqrt{2}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c = 2$, then we get $a = 4$, but this does not work since $\sqrt{4+\sqrt{2}}$ is not an integer.

For $b=3$, we get $(c^2-a-3)(c^2-a+3) = 9$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-5$, which doesn't work. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=2$, which does work since $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{4} = 2$. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=8$, which doesn't work.

For $b=4$, we get $(c^2-a-4)(c^2-a+4) = 16$. If we try $c = 1$, we get $a = -15$, which doesn't work. If we try $c = 2$, we get $a = 1$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. If we try $c = 3$, we get $a = 11$, which works since $\sqrt{11+\sqrt{4}} = \sqrt{13}$. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

For $b=5$, we get $(c^2-a-5)(c^2-a+5) = 25$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-21$, which is not within the given range. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-3$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-3+\sqrt{5}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=5$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. If we try $c=4$, we get $a=15$, which works since $\sqrt{15+\sqrt{5}} = \sqrt{20} = 4$. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

For $b=6$, we get $(c^2-a-6)(c^2-a+6) = 36$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-35$, which is not within the given range. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-8$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-8+\sqrt{6}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=2$, which does work since $\sqrt{2+\sqrt{6}}$ is an integer. If we try $c=4$, we get $a=14$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

For $b=7$, we get $(c^2-a-7)(c^2-a+7) = 49$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-48$, which doesn't work. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-13$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-13+\sqrt{7}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=7$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

For $b=8$, we get $(c^2-a-8)(c^2-a+8) = 64$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-63$, which doesn't work. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-18$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-18+\sqrt{8}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=12$, which works since $\sqrt{12+\sqrt{8}} = \sqrt{16} = 4$. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

For $b=9$, we get $(c^2-a-9)(c^2-a+9) = 81$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-80$, which is not within the given range. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-23$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-23+\sqrt{9}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=17$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

Finally, for $b=10$, we get $(c^2-a-10)(c^2-a+10) = 100$. If we try $c=1$, we get $a=-99$, which is not within the given range. If we try $c=2$, we get $a=-28$, which doesn't work since $\sqrt{-28+\sqrt{10}}$ is not an integer. If we try $c=3$, we get $a=22$, which doesn't work since we've already counted that case. If we try $c=4$, we get $a=36$, which works since $\sqrt{36+\sqrt{10}} = \sqrt{40} = 6$. There are no other values of $c$ that work.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{7}$ pairs $(a,b)$ that work: $(3,1)$, $(2,3)$, $(11,4)$, $(4,6)$, $(3,10)$, $(12,8)$, and $(6,10)$.

There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\dfrac{8 \times 5 \times 6!}{8} = 5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can solve this problem by using the technique of complementary counting. 

First, let's count the total number of seatings without any restrictions. We can start by fixing one person in place, say Alice. Then, we have 7 seats left for the remaining people to sit in. We can choose one of them to sit next to Alice in 7 ways. Once that person is seated, we have 6 seats left for the remaining 6 people to sit in. We can seat them in any order, so the total number of seatings without any restrictions is:

7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040

Now, let's count the number of seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other. We can think of Alice and Bob as a single unit, and then we have 7 units to arrange around the table. We can arrange them in 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040 ways. However, within each of these arrangements, Alice and Bob can switch places, so we need to multiply by 2 to get the total number of seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other:

2 x 5040 = 10080

Finally, we can subtract the number of seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other from the total number of seatings without any restrictions to get the number of seatings where Alice and Bob don't sit next to each other:

5040 - 10080 = -5040

Wait, that's negative! What does that mean? It means we made a mistake in our counting. The mistake is that we overcounted some of the seatings where Alice and Bob sit next to each other. Specifically, we counted each seating twice, once for Alice being next to Bob and once for Bob being next to Alice. So, we need to subtract those double-counted seatings once to get the correct answer:

5040 - 5040/2 = 2520

Therefore, there are 2520 ways to seat 8 people around a table if Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other.

We can make a table to count the possible outcomes and their probabilities:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
& 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
1 & 0 & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{8} \\ \hline

4 & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{8} & \frac{1}{8} & 0
\end{array}
\]The entry in the $i$th row and $j$th column is the probability of rolling a $i$ on one die and a $j$ on the other. Notice that there is an equal probability of rolling any nonzero number on one die.

If the player chooses a $1,$ there is a $\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$ chance of winning $2,$ a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of losing $1,$ and a $\frac{1}{4}$ chance of winning $1.$ So the expected return for choosing $1$ is $$\frac{1}{4}(2)+\frac{1}{2}(-1)+\frac{1}{4}(1)=-\frac{1}{4}.$$Similarly, the expected return for choosing $2$ is $\frac{1}{4}(2)+\frac{1}{2}(-1)+\frac{1}{4}(1)=-\frac{1}{4},$ the expected return for choosing $3$ is $\frac{1}{4}(2)+\frac{1}{2}(-1)+\frac{1}{4}(1)=-\frac{1}{4},$ and the expected return for choosing $4$ is $\frac{1}{4}(2)+\frac{1}{2}(-1)+\frac{1}{4}(1)=-\frac{1}{4}.$

Thus, the expected return for one roll of the dice is $$\frac{1}{4}\left(-1-1-1-1\right)=\boxed{-\frac{1}{1}=-1}$$dollar.

When counting forwards, every number appears once and so we know that $53$ is the $51^{st}$ counting number if and only if $52$ numbers were counted before it. So, there are $52$ counting numbers between $3$ and $53$ and so there must be $146$ between $53$ and $201$, inclusive. Thus, $53$ is the $146^{th}$ number counted when counting backwards from $201$ to $3$. Therefore, our final answer is $\boxed{146}$.

We note that $3\cdot7\cdot19=399$ is close to the largest number we can get $(3\cdot60+59=239)$, and $2\cdot7\cdot19=266$ is close to being the largest multiple of $7$ we can get. So we look at all of the multiples of $7$ from $7$ to $399$: $$7,14,21,\dots,385,392.$$ There are $57$ multiples of $7$ in this list. The probability of picking one of these multiples of $7$ at random is $\frac{57}{3\cdot60}=0.3175$. Hence the probability that Gerry's three digit number (based on a $12$-hour clock) is divisible by $7$ is $\boxed{0.3175}$.

Note: We could have also solved this problem using modular arithmetic. Another way to list multiples of $7$ is to list multiples of $7$ from $0$ to $6$ and then add multiples of $7$ to any number on this list until we get to $1000$.

We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{6} = \boxed{20}$ triangles.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's consider two cases for when segments $AB$ and $CD$ do not intersect: either $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, or they are not parallel but do not intersect.

The probability that $AB$ is parallel to $CD$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, since we can choose any two diameters of the circle as $AB$ and $CD$, and any pair of diameters is equally likely. In this case, $AB$ and $CD$ clearly do not intersect.

The probability that $AB$ and $CD$ are not parallel but do not intersect is zero. This is because given $AB$ and one point $C$, there is exactly one point $D$ such that $CD$ does not intersect $AB$. Therefore, the probability that $AB$ and $CD$ are not parallel and do not intersect is the probability that $AB$ and $CD$ intersect subtracted from the probability that $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, which is $1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Therefore, the probability that $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is $1 - \frac{1}{2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

There are 9 options for the first/last digit (1 through 9 -- the first digit cannot be 0), and there are 10 options for the second/third digit (0 through 9).  This gives us $9 \cdot 10 = \boxed{90}$ four-digit palindromes.

A four-digit palindrome is of the form ABBA, where A and B are digits between 1 and 9 inclusive. There are 9 choices for A (since 0 cannot be the first digit) and 10 choices for B (since 0 can be any other digit). Thus, there are $9\times 10 = 90$ ways to choose A and B. Once A and B are chosen, the palindrome is fixed. Therefore, there are 90 four-digit palindromes.

The Binomial Theorem says that, to find the coefficient of $x^ay^b$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^{a+b}$, we choose $a$ of the $(a+b)$ terms to contribute $x$ to the product, then the other $b$ terms contribute a $y$. Similarly, to find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in $(x+y+z)^8$, we choose 3 of the 8 $(x+y+z)$ terms in the product $(x+y+z)^8$ to contribute an $x$ (which we can do in $\binom{8}{3}$ ways), 3 of the remaining 5 terms to contribute a $y$ (which we can do in $\binom{5}{3}$ ways), and the remaining 2 terms contribute $z$'s to the product.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$, we need to consider all the ways we can obtain this term when expanding the expression using the binomial theorem.

First, observe that we can obtain a term involving $x^3y^3z^2$ by selecting three factors of $x$, three factors of $y$, and two factors of $z$ from the expression $(x+y+z)^8$. The number of ways to do this can be computed using the binomial coefficient $\binom{8}{3}\binom{5}{3}\binom{2}{2}$. The factor $\binom{8}{3}$ gives the number of ways to select three factors of $x$ from the eight factors of $(x+y+z)$, the factor $\binom{5}{3}$ gives the number of ways to select three factors of $y$ from the remaining five factors after selecting the three factors of $x$, and the factor $\binom{2}{2}$ gives the number of ways to select two factors of $z$ from the remaining two factors.

Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is:

$$\binom{8}{3}\binom{5}{3}\binom{2}{2}=56 \cdot 10 \cdot 1=560$$

Therefore, the coefficient of $x^3y^3z^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y+z)^8$ is $\boxed{560}$.

If $a \geq 4$, then $a^3+b^2+c>a^3\geq 4^3>50$. But we want $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, so we must have $a=2$.  Now we substitute $a=2$ into $a^3+b^2+c \leq 50$, which gives $b^2+c\leq 42$. Since $b^2<42$, we know that $b$ must be one of 2, 4, or 6.

When $b=2,$ $c\leq 38$. There are 19 even positive integers less than or equal to 38, namely $2\times 1$, $2\times 2$, $\ldots$, $2\times 19$.

When $b=4,$ $c\leq 26$. There are 13 even positive integers less than or equal to 26.

When $b=6,$ $c\leq 6$. There are 3 even positive integers less than or equal to 6.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to count the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ of even positive integers that satisfy $a^3 + b^2 + c \leq 50$. Since $a,b,c$ are even, we can write $a = 2x$, $b = 2y$, and $c = 2z$ for some non-negative integers $x,y,z$. Substituting, we get $8x^3 + 4y^2 + 2z \leq 50$, or equivalently, $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$. 

Let $N$ be the number of triples $(x,y,z)$ of non-negative integers that satisfy $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$. We will count $N$ using casework on the value of $z$:

Case 1: $z = 0$. In this case, we need $4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 25$. Note that since $x,y$ are non-negative, we have $4x^3 + 2y^2 \geq 0$. Thus, $4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 25$ if and only if $0 \leq x \leq 2$ and $0 \leq y \leq 2$. There are $3 \times 3 = 9$ triples $(x,y,0)$ that satisfy this condition.

Case 2: $z = 2$. In this case, we need $4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 23$. Again, note that $4x^3 + 2y^2 \geq 0$, so $4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 23$ if and only if $0 \leq x \leq 2$, $0 \leq y \leq 2$, and $2 \leq 4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 23$. The last inequality is equivalent to $1 \leq 2x^3 + y^2 \leq 11$. We can count the number of pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $2x^3 + y^2 = k$ for each $k$ between $1$ and $11$ as follows:

$2x^3 + y^2 = 1$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 2$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is even, so $2x^3 + y^2$ is even
$2x^3 + y^2 = 3$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 4$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (1,0)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 5$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (1,1)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 6$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (1,2)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 7$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 8$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (2,0)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 9$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (2,1)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 10$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (2,2)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 11$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd

Thus, there are $9$ triples $(2x,2y,2)$ that satisfy $4x^3 + 2y^2 + 2 \leq 25$.

Case 3: $z = 4$. In this case, we need $4x^3 + 2y^2 \leq 21$. By a similar argument to Case 2, we can count the number of pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy $2x^3 + y^2 = k$ for each $k$ between $1$ and $10$. We get the following counts:

$2x^3 + y^2 = 1$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 2$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is even, so $2x^3 + y^2$ is even
$2x^3 + y^2 = 3$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 4$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (1,0)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 5$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (1,1)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 6$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is even
$2x^3 + y^2 = 7$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (2,1)$
$2x^3 + y^2 = 8$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is even
$2x^3 + y^2 = 9$ has no solutions, since $2x^3$ is even and $y^2$ is odd
$2x^3 + y^2 = 10$ has one solution, namely $(x,y) = (2,2)$

Thus, there are $6$ triples $(2x,2y,4)$ that satisfy $4x^3 + 2y^2 + 4 \leq 25$.

In all other cases, we have $z \geq 6$ and thus $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \geq 4x^3 + 2y^2 + 6 > 25$. Therefore, there are no triples $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$ and $z \geq 6$.

Adding up the counts from the three cases, we get a total of $9 + 9 + 6 = 24$ triples $(a,b,c)$ that satisfy $a^3 + b^2 + c \leq 50$ and are thus counted by $N$. Each such triple corresponds to a unique triple $(x,y,z)$ of non-negative integers satisfying $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$, and vice versa. Thus, $N = 24$.

Finally, we need to find the number of even positive integers $a$ such that $(a,b,c)$ is counted by $N$ for some even positive integers $b$ and $c$. We can write $a = 2x$ for some positive integer $x$, and then $(a,b,c)$ is counted by $N$ if and only if $(x,y,z)$ satisfies $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$. Thus, we need to count the number of positive integers $x$ such that $4x^3 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$ for some non-negative integers $y,z$. Note that $4x^3 \leq 25$ if and only if $x \leq 1$, so we have two candidates for $x$: $x = 1$ and $x = 2$. 

For $x = 1$, we need to count the number of non-negative integers $y,z$ such that $2y^2 + z \leq 21$. Using casework on the value of $z$, we find that there are $46$ such pairs $(y,z)$.

For $x = 2$, we need to count the number of non-negative integers $y,z$ such that $32 + 2y^2 + z \leq 25$, or equivalently, $2y^2 + z \leq -7$. Since $y,z$ are non-negative, the only solution is $(y,z) = (0,0)$. However, this does not correspond to a valid triple $(a,b,c)$, since $a = 4$ implies $b^2 + c > 50 - 4^3 = 2$. Thus, there are no such positive integers $x$.

Therefore, the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ of even positive integers satisfying $a^3 + b^2 + c \leq 50$ is the number of $a$ that are twice positive integers and have $(a,b,c)$ counted in $N$ for some even positive integers $b,c$. There are $2$ such values of $a$ ($a = 2$ and $a = 4$), and for each such value of $a$ there are $N = 24$ corresponding triples $(a,b,c)$, giving a total of $2 \times 24 = \boxed{48}$ triples.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $3^2=9$ points in $S$. We begin by counting the number of vertical lines (i.e. lines of the form $x=c$). There are three vertical lines, each of which passes through three points in $S$. Thus, there are $\binom{9}{2}/3=12$ distinct lines of this form. Similarly, there are 12 horizontal lines. Now, suppose that $a \neq b$ and $(a,b)$ is one of the diagonal points in $S$. Then there are 4 lines passing through $(a,b)$ that are of the form $y=x+c$ and 4 lines passing through $(a,b)$ that are of the form $y=-x+c$. Thus, each diagonal point contributes 8 distinct lines. Since there are four diagonal points, there are a total of $12+12+4\cdot 8 = \boxed{56}$ distinct lines passing through at least two members of $S$.

There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the units place.

There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the tens place.

There are $8$ numbers with a $6$ in the tens place and a $6$ in the units place. (Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)

Adding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times. Therefore subtract $2$ from $28$ to get $\boxed{26}$ numbers containing the digit $6$ at least twice.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/counting_and_probability/994_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can use complementary counting and count the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ inclusive that do not contain the digit $6$ at least twice. 

We will split this into three cases:
Case 1: Two-digit numbers (from $10$ to $99$)
For a two-digit number, there are $9$ choices for the first digit (since it cannot be $0$ or $6$), and $9$ choices for the second digit (since it cannot be $6$). So there are $9\cdot 9=81$ two-digit numbers that do not contain the digit $6$ at least twice.

Case 2: Three-digit numbers (from $100$ to $999$)
Suppose a three-digit number does not contain the digit $6.$ Then its hundreds digit must be $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $7,$ $8,$ or $9,$ for $8$ choices. For the tens digit, there are $9$ choices (since it cannot be $0$ or $6$), and for the units digit, there are $9$ choices. Therefore, there are $8\cdot 9\cdot 9=648$ three-digit numbers that do not contain the digit $6$ at least twice.

Case 3: Four-digit numbers (from $1000$ to $8000$)
A four-digit number that does not contain the digit $6$ at least twice must belong to one of two mutually exclusive groups:
Group 1: those with a $1$ as the thousands digit. For a number in this group, the thousands digit is fixed at $1,$ the hundreds digit has $8$ choices (anything but $6$ or $1$), and the tens digit and units digit both have $9$ choices, for $8\cdot 9\cdot 9=648$ total numbers in this group.
Group 2: those with a digit other than $1$ as the thousands digit. For a number in this group, the thousands digit has $7$ choices (any digit other than $6$ and $1$), the hundreds digit has $9$ choices, and the tens digit and units digit also have $9$ choices, for $7\cdot 9\cdot 9\cdot 9=5103$ total numbers in this group.

Therefore, the total number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ inclusive that do not contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $$81+648+648+5103=6480.$$Therefore, the number of natural numbers from $1$ to $800$ inclusive that contain the digit $6$ at least twice is $$800-6480=\boxed{5680}.$$
