Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to convert the prices to base ten. 

$242_5 = 2(5^2) + 4(5^1) + 2(5^0) = 62$

$367_8 = 3(8^2) + 6(8^1) + 7(8^0) = 231$

Next, we can calculate the cost for labor:

$62 \cdot 3.5 = 217$

To calculate the total cost, we need to add the cost of equipment:

$217 + 231 = 448$

Therefore, Kirsty will owe the plumber $\boxed{448}$ dollars in base ten.

Jan steps on step number $s$ if $13\leq s \leq 130$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.  Jen steps on step number $s$ if $3\leq s \leq 139$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.  Therefore, we are counting the number of integers between $13$ and $130$ which leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$ and a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$. Let's check the remainders of Jan's first few steps when divided by 4. \[
13 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
16 \rightarrow 0
\] \[
19 \rightarrow 3
\] \[
22 \rightarrow 2
\] \[
25 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
\vdots
\] We see that the remainders of Jan's steps when divided by 4 cycle through the list $1,0,3,2$. Therefore, only every fourth step that Jan steps on will also be stepped on by Jen, so we are counting the number of elements in $\{19,31,43,\ldots,127\}$.  Writing this list in the form  \[\{19+0\cdot12,19+1\cdot12,19+2\cdot12,\ldots,19+9\cdot12\},\] we see that $\boxed{10}$ steps are stepped on by both Jen and Jan.

Note: This problem is essentially an application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Extracting Answer from: 
Jan begins by stepping down three steps: from 130 to 127. Then he steps down another three steps, from 127 to 124. Continuing in this pattern, he steps on every third step all the way down to step 13. There are $\frac{130-13}{3}+1=40$ such steps, so Jan steps on 40 steps.

Jen begins by stepping up four steps: from 3 to 7. Then she steps up another four steps, from 7 to 11. Continuing in this pattern, she steps on every fourth step all the way up to step 139. There are $\frac{139-11}{4}+1=33$ such steps, so Jen steps on 33 steps. 

We want to find the number of steps they both stepped on. The lowest step both could have stepped on is the greater of their starting points, which is step 130. The highest step they both could have stepped on is the smaller of their ending points, which is step 13. Note that step 13 is a multiple of 3, so Jan did step on it. The common difference between the steps they stepped on is $\text{lcm}(3,4)=12$, so the number of steps they both stepped on is the number of integers from 130 to 13 inclusive that are multiples of 12. Since $12 \times 11=132$ is greater than 130, the two numbers between 130 and 132 that are multiples of 12 are 132 and 120, so we have: $$\left\lfloor \frac{120-132}{-12} \right\rfloor+1 = 2$$  Therefore, Jan and Jen stepped on $\boxed{2}$ common steps.

Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:7$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=7k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 7 are relatively prime.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $A = 3k$ and $B = 7k$ for some positive integer $k$. Since $\text{lcm}(A, B) = 1575$, we must have $\gcd(A, B)\cdot\text{lcm}(A, B) = AB$. Substituting, we have $1575\gcd(A, B) = (3k)(7k)$. Since 3 and 7 are relatively prime, the number $3k$ must be divisible by 7, and the number $7k$ must be divisible by 3. Therefore, both $k$ and $3k$ must be divisible by 7, and both $k$ and $7k$ must be divisible by 3. This means that $k$ must be divisible by both 3 and 7, or in other words, $k$ must be divisible by 21. It follows that $\gcd(A,B) = \frac{AB}{\text{lcm}(A,B)} = \frac{(3k)(7k)}{1575} = \frac{3}{25}\cdot\frac{7}{9}\cdot k^2$. Note that $\frac{3}{25}$ and $\frac{7}{9}$ are relatively prime, so $k^2$ must be divisible by 25 and by 9. Therefore, $k$ must be divisible by both 3 and 5, or in other words, $k$ must be divisible by 15. It follows that $\gcd(A,B) = \frac{3}{25}\cdot\frac{7}{9}\cdot k^2 = \frac{3}{25}\cdot\frac{7}{9}\cdot 15^2 = \boxed{315}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The units digit of a number is the digit in the ones place, or the remainder when the number is divided by 10. We can simplify each term separately:

For the first term, we have $(972 - 268)(973 - 267)(974 - 266)$. Notice that the difference between each pair of terms is the same: $972 - 268 = 704$, $973 - 267 = 706$, and $974 - 266 = 708$. Let's find the units digit of each of these differences:

$$\begin{array}{c|c} 
\text{Difference} & \text{Units Digit} \\ \hline
704 & 4 \\
706 & 6 \\
708 & 8 \\
\end{array}$$

Multiplying the units digits of these differences gives us $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 = 192$, which has a units digit of 2. Therefore, the units digit of the first term is the same as the units digit of $(972 - 268)(973 - 267)(974 - 266) = 2$.

For the second term, we have $(968 - 272)(967 - 273)(966 - 274)$. Again, the differences between each pair of terms are the same: $968 - 272 = 696$, $967 - 273 = 694$, and $966 - 274 = 692$. Using the same process as before, the units digit of this term is the same as the units digit of $(968 - 272)(967 - 273)(966 - 274) = 4$.

For the third term, we have $(999 - 222)^3$. The units digit of $999 - 222 = 777$ is 7, so the units digit of this term is the same as the units digit of $7^3 = 343$, which is 3.

There are a total of $\binom{8}{2} = 28$ ways to choose two digits out of the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9\}.$ We can eliminate the digits $2$ and $5$ as they cannot be on the units digit of a prime number. We are then left with $\binom{6}{2} =15$ pairs of digits. We check each of these for primality:

\begin{align*}
13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71
\end{align*}

We notice that $46$ and $64$ are the only pairs that can be reversed and still produce a prime number. These two pairs, along with the other primes, yield the four desired primes: $13, 47, 59$ and $61,$ whose sum is $\boxed{180}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the residues of $N$ modulo $5$, $6$, and $7$. Since the units digit of $N$ in base $6$ is equal to $0$, it follows that $N$ is divisible by $6$. Also, we note that $N$ is congruent modulo $b-1$ to the sum of its base $b$ digits. Indeed, if $N$ can be represented as $(\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\cdots a_0})_b$, then \begin{align*}N &\equiv a_k \cdot b^k + a_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 \cdot b + a_0 \\ &\equiv a_k \cdot ((b-1) + 1)^k + \cdots + a_1 \cdot ((b-1) + 1) + a_0 \\
& \equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \pmod{b-1}.
\end{align*}It follows that $N \equiv 5+3+1+3+4+0 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ and that $N \equiv 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.$ By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, we determine that $N \equiv 31 \pmod{35}$, so that (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again) $N \equiv \boxed{66} \pmod{210}$.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/number_theory/1129_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We first find what $N$ is in base $10$. We have  \begin{align*}
N &= 5 \cdot 6^5 + 3 \cdot 6^4 + 1 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 0 \cdot 6^0 \\
&= 5 \cdot 7776 + 3 \cdot 1296 + 1 \cdot 216 + 3 \cdot 36 + 4 \cdot 6 + 0  \\
&= 38622,
\end{align*}and \begin{align*}
N &= 1 \cdot 8^5 + 2 \cdot 8^4 + 4 \cdot 8^3 + 1 \cdot 8^2 + 5 \cdot 8^1 + 4 \cdot 8^0 \\
&= 32768 + 8192 + 2048 + 64 + 40 + 4 \\
&= 43316.
\end{align*}Let's now try to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the residue of $N$ modulo $210$: \begin{align*}
N &\equiv 2 \pmod{3}, \\
N &\equiv 1 \pmod{5}, \\
N &\equiv 16 \pmod{7}, \\
N &\equiv 26 \pmod{11}, \\
N &\equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
\end{align*}Looking at the last congruence, we see that $N$ must be odd. Since $N \equiv 16 \pmod{7}$, we know that $N$ is also $\equiv 2 \pmod{4}$, so it follows that $N \equiv 2 \pmod{12}$. That means $N$ is congruent to $1$ or $7$ modulo $3$, so $N \equiv 7 \pmod{3}$, and thus we have \[
N \equiv 7 \pmod{3}, \quad N \equiv 1 \pmod{5}, \quad N \equiv 16 \pmod{7}, \quad N \equiv 26 \pmod{11}.
\]Next, we look $\bmod\  7$ and $\bmod\ 11$ to figure out what $N$ is $\bmod \ 77$: \begin{align*}
N &\equiv 16 \pmod{7} \quad \Rightarrow \quad N \equiv 12 \pmod{77} \\
N &\equiv 26 \pmod{11} \quad \Rightarrow \quad N \equiv 59 \pmod{77}.
\end{align*}Now, we treat $12$ and $59$ as if they were both positive integers between $1$ and $76$ and find by trial and error that $59 - 12 = 47$ is divisible by $7$. Hence $N\equiv 12 \pmod {77}$ and $N\equiv 2\pmod {4}$, so $N \equiv 12 \pmod{4\cdot 77}$. Thus we get \[
N \equiv 7 \cdot 77 \cdot 11 + 1 \cdot 77 \cdot 2 + 12 \cdot 5 \cdot 4\pmod{210},
\]which simplifies to $N \equiv 1637 \pmod{210}$, so the answer is $\boxed{137}$.

A three-digit palindrome must be of the form $1\Box1, 2\Box2, \cdots 9\Box9$, where $\Box$ is any digit from 0 to 9. So there are $9\cdot10=90$ three-digit palindromes. Now we look at which ones are multiples of 3. Recall that a positive integer is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. If we look at $1\Box1$, we want $1+1+\Box$ to be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 1, 4, or 7. With $2\Box2$, $2+2+\Box$ should be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 2, 5, or 8. With $3\Box3$, $\Box$ could be 0, 3, 6, or 9. The possible $\Box$ values then repeat, $4\Box4$ giving 1, 4, or 7, $5\Box5$ giving 2, 5, or 8, etc. So the number of multiples of 3 is $3\times (3+3+4)=30$. Since there are 90 three-digit palindromes in all, we get a probability of $\frac{30}{90}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To be a multiple of 3, the sum of the digits of the palindrome number must be a multiple of 3. There are 90 three-digit palindrome numbers in total (from 101 to 999), so we need to count how many of them have digits that sum to a multiple of 3.

Starting with the smallest palindrome, 101, we can list out all the palindromes with digits that sum to a multiple of 3:

* 111, 121, 131, ..., 171, 181, 191 (10 numbers)
* 202, 212, 222, ..., 272, 282 (9 numbers)
* 303, 313, 323, ..., 363, 373 (9 numbers)
* 404, 414, 424, ..., 474, 484 (9 numbers)
* 505, 515, 525, ..., 575, 585 (9 numbers)
* 606, 616, 626, ..., 676, 686 (9 numbers)
* 707, 717, 727, ..., 777, 787 (9 numbers)
* 808, 818, 828, ..., 878, 888 (9 numbers)
* 909, 919, 929, ..., 979, 989, 999 (10 numbers)

There are 9 palindromes for each congruence class modulo 3 (i.e. the 1's, 2's, and 0's), and there are 3 congruence classes. Therefore, there are a total of $3 \cdot 9 = 27$ three-digit palindromes that are divisible by 3.

The probability of choosing one of these 27 palindromes at random is:

$$\frac{27}{90} = \frac{3}{10} = 0.3 = \boxed{30\%}$$

The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2\cdot11$. So for $\frac{n}{99}$ to be in lowest terms, $n$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 11. The possible values of $n$ are from 1 to 98, inclusive, so there are 98 possible values for $n$. We can find the number of multiples of 3 and multiples of 11 and subtract from 98 to get the number of values that aren't divisible by 3 or 11. For multiples of 3, we go from 3 to 96, or $3\cdot1$ to $3\cdot32$, so there are 32 multiples of 3 from 1 to 98, inclusive. For multiples of 11, we go from 11 to 88, so there are 8 multiples of 11 from 1 to 98, inclusive. We have to make sure we don't double-count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 11: 33 and 66. So there are $32+8-2=38$ values of $n$ that are divisible by 3 or 11. That means there are $98-38=\boxed{60}$ values of $n$ for which $\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first compute the prime factorization of 2010, which is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$. Therefore, if we want $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ to be a repeating decimal, then $n^2$ cannot be divisible by 3 and 67 at the same time. If this were the case, then we could convert our fraction to $\frac{k}{10}$, where $201k = n^2$, and $\frac{k}{10}$ is clearly a terminating decimal. Conversely, no simplified terminating decimal has a factor of 3 or 67 in the denominator. It follows that if $n$ is not divisible by $3\cdot 67$, then $n$ is a repeating decimal. Therefore, we need to compute the number of values of $n$ that yield squares which are not divisible by 3 and 67. However, $n^2$ is divisible by 3 and 67 if and only if $n$ must be divisible by 3 and 67. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $3 \cdot 67=201$. There are $10$ multiplies of $201$ which are less than or equal to $2010$, so there are $2010 - 10 = \boxed{2000}$ values of $n$ that yield a fraction $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ which is a repeating decimal.

Extracting Answer from: 
We observe that for the fraction $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ to result in a repeating decimal, the denominator must have a prime factorization that does not include $2$ or $5.$ The prime factorization of $2010$ is $2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot67.$ Dividing out the factors of $2$ and $5,$ we are left with $3\cdot67.$ Note that since $n\leq2010,$ $n$ can have at most one factor of $3$ or $67.$ This is because if $n$ has two factors of $3$ or two factors of $67,$ then $n^2$ has more than one factor of $3$ or $67,$ which means the denominator does not reduce to a whole number.

Therefore, we count the integers between $1$ and $2010$ that have one factor of $3$ or one factor of $67:$
There are $\left\lfloor\frac{2010}{3}\right\rfloor=670$ multiples of $3$ less than or equal to $2010.$
There are $\left\lfloor\frac{2010}{67}\right\rfloor=30$ multiples of $67$ less than or equal to $2010.$
Note that we are double counting $2010$ itself, which has both a factor of $3$ and a factor of $67,$ so we subtract $1$ from our total. Thus, the total number of fractions $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ that have a repeating decimal is $670+30-1=\boxed{699}.$

The base-$b$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$ if and only if $2013$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $b$: that is, if $2010$ is a multiple of $b.$ Since $2010 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 67^1,$ it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ positive divisors. However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$). Therefore, the answer is $16 - 3 = \boxed{13}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
We want $2013$ to be of the form $N\cdot b+3$ for some $N$. Because we know that $2013$ ends in a $3$, $N\cdot b$ must end in $0$. Thus, because $b>3$, we see that $N$ must end in zero as well. In particular, we know that $N$ ends in $0$ in base $b$. Therefore we have $2013=N\cdot b+3=a_{n}a_{n-1}\cdots a_{1}a_{0}\cdot b+3$, where each $a_{i}$ is less than $b$. This is equivalent to $$ 2010 = a_{n}a_{n-1}\cdots a_{1}a_{0}\cdot b +  (3-b).  $$ We know that $2<b\leqslant 9$, so we try each base $5$ and above. $5$ does not work, as $2010$ is not a multiple of $4$. For $b=6$, we note that the sum of the digits of $2013$ in base $6$ is $2+0+1+3=6$, which is a multiple of $3$. We now verify that the base-$6$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$, which it does indeed. For $b\geqslant 7$, $2010$ is not a multiple of $6$, so the corresponding base $b$ number does not end in a $3$.

Therefore, only $b=\boxed{1},\boxed{6}$ work.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can first simplify the expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: $$1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100} = \frac{2^{101}-1}{2-1}.$$ Next, we want to find the remainder when $\frac{2^{101}-1}{1}$ is divided by 7. Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that $2^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$ since 7 is a prime and 2 is not divisible by 7. Thus, $2^{102} \equiv (2^6)^{17} \cdot 2^6 \equiv 2^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, so $2^{101}-1$ has a remainder of 6 when divided by 7. Therefore, the original expression has a remainder of $\boxed{6}$ when divided by 7.

If we first get a "common denominator" as if 3 and 13 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\frac 13 + \frac 1{13} \equiv \frac{13 + 3}{39} \equiv \frac{16}{2 \cdot 19 + 1} \equiv \frac {16}1 \equiv \boxed{16} \pmod{19}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \equiv 3^{-1} \pmod{19}$ and $b \equiv 13^{-1} \pmod{19}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$\textbf{Solution:}$ We will first use Fermat's Little Theorem, which tells us that $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ for any prime $p$ and any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$. This implies that $a^{-1} \equiv a^{p-2} \pmod{p}$. Hence we see that $3^{-1} \equiv 3^{17} \pmod{19}$ and $13^{-1} \equiv 13^{17} \pmod{19}$.
We then have $3^{-1}+13^{-1} \equiv 3^{17}+13^{17} \pmod{19}$. We can use Fermat's Little Theorem again to simplify this further: $$3^{17}+13^{17} \equiv 3^{-1} + 13^{-1} \equiv 3^{18-1} + 13^{18-1} \equiv 3^{3} + 13^{3} \pmod{19}.$$
Finally, we can compute $3^3$ and $13^3$ using the fact that $3^3 = 27 \equiv 8 \pmod{19}$ and $13^3 = 2197 \equiv 5 \pmod{19}$, so $$3^{3} + 13^{3} \equiv 8+5\equiv 13 \pmod{19}.$$Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{13}$.

Note that $14$, $46$, and $100$ all have a common factor of $2$, so we can divide it out: the solutions to $$14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}$$ are identical to the solutions to $$7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.$$ Make sure you see why this is the case.

Now we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $7$ to obtain $$49u \equiv 161 \pmod{50},$$ which also has the same solutions as the previous congruence, since we could reverse the step above by multiplying both sides by $7^{-1}$. (We know that $7^{-1}$ exists modulo $50$ because $7$ and $50$ are relatively prime.)

Replacing each side of $49u\equiv 161$ by a $\pmod{50}$ equivalent, we have $$-u \equiv 11\pmod{50},$$ and thus $$u \equiv -11\pmod{50}.$$ This is the set of solutions to our original congruence. The two smallest positive solutions are $-11+50 = 39$ and $-11+2\cdot 50 = 89$. Their average is $\boxed{64}$.

We can simplify the congruence by dividing both sides by $31$ to obtain \[n\equiv 31^{-1}\cdot 3 \pmod{2293}.\]We want to find the inverse of $31$ modulo $2293$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have \begin{align*}
\text{gcd}(2293, 31) &= \text{gcd}(31, 3) \\
&= \text{gcd}(3, 1) \\
&= 1.
\end{align*}Hence, by the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can find integers $a$ and $b$ such that \[\text{gcd}(2293,31)=31a+2293b.\]It follows that \[1=31a+2293b.\]Multiplying both sides by $3$, we get \[3=93a+6879b.\]It follows that $31(-93)\equiv 1 \pmod{2293}$, so the inverse of $31$ modulo $2293$ is $-93\equiv 2200$. Thus, we have  \[n\equiv 31^{-1}\cdot 3 \equiv 2200\cdot 3 \equiv 6600 \equiv \boxed{1147} \pmod{2293}.\]

We are given that $N\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ and $N\equiv 3\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ and $x\equiv 3\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer.

Let's first use the information about groups of 8. If there are $N$ students in total, then we know that $N$ is 5 more than a multiple of 8. In other words, we can write $N=8k+5$ for some integer $k$. 

Now let's use the information about groups of 6. If there are $N$ students in total, then we know that $N$ is 3 more than a multiple of 6. In other words, we can write $N=6m+3$ for some integer $m$. 

We want to find all possible values of $N$ that satisfy both of these conditions. So we can set our two expressions for $N$ equal to each other and solve for $k$: 

\begin{align*}
8k+5 &= 6m+3 \\
8k+2 &= 6m \\
4k+1 &= 3m
\end{align*}

This tells us that $4k+1$ is a multiple of 3. The first few values of $4k+1$ that are multiples of 3 are 4 (when $k=1$) and 13 (when $k=8$). We can check that both of these values of $k$ lead to a valid value of $N$: 

\begin{align*}
N &= 8k+5 \\
N &= 13 \quad \implies \quad k=2, N=21 \\
N &= 4 \quad \implies \quad k=-\frac{1}{4}, \text{ which is not possible since } k \text{ must be an integer.} \\

Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $N$ is $21$, and we are done.

Let's say the number is represented by x. 

If x is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, meaning that:

x = 5n + 3 where n is an integer 

If we multiply both sides of this equation by 2, we get:

2x = 10n + 6

Now let's divide both sides of this equation by 5:

2x ÷ 5 = (10n + 6) ÷ 5

2x ÷ 5 = 2n + 1.2

We can see that when we divide 2x by 5, the remainder is 2. 

Therefore, the remainder when twice the original number is divided by 5 is 2.

The units digit of a power of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer; that is, the tens digit, hundreds digit, etc... of the integer have no effect on the units digit of the result. In this problem, the units digit of $19^{19}$ is the units digit of $9^{19}$. Note that $9^1=9$ ends in 9, $9^2=81$ ends in 1, $9^3=729$ ends in 9, and, in general, the units digit of odd powers of 9 is 9, whereas the units digit of even powers of 9 is 1. Since both exponents are odd, the sum of their units digits is $9+9=18$, the units digit of which is $\boxed{8}.$

Let's observe the units digit of the first few powers of 9.

$\begin{array}{c|c} 19^1 & 9 \\ 19^2 & 1 \\ 19^3 & 9 \\ 19^4 & 1 \\ 19^5 & 9 \\ \vdots & \vdots \end{array}$

We see that the units digit of $19^n$ repeats in cycles of 2: 9, 1, 9, 1, $\ldots$.

By the same reasoning, the units digit of $99^n$ repeats in cycles of 2: 9, 1, 9, 1, $\ldots$.

Thus, the units digit of $19^{19} + 99^{99}$ is $9+1=\boxed{0}$.

The residue of $4n\pmod 6$ is determined by the residue of $n\pmod 6.$ We can build a table showing the possibilities: $$\begin{array}{r || c * 5 {| c}}

So, our problem is to count all $n$ between $0$ and $60$ that leave a remainder of $2$ or $5$ modulo $6.$ These integers are $$2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, \ldots, 56, 59.$$There are $\boxed{20}$ integers in this list.

We can simplify this congruence as follows: $$4n\equiv 2\pmod 6 \iff 2n\equiv 1\pmod 3.$$ Since $2$ is relatively prime to $3$, we can multiply both sides by $2^{-1}$, the modular inverse of $2$ modulo $3$. We get $$n\equiv 2\pmod 3.$$ Thus, $n$ must be of the form $n=3k+2$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer.

Since $0<n<60$, we must have $0<3k+2<60$, or equivalently, $0\leq k\leq 19$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{20}$ integers $n$ that satisfy the given congruence.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/number_theory/227_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by assigning variables to the unknowns in the problem. Let's call the total amount of milk in all the cups "m" and the total amount of coffee "c". 

We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk, so we can write an equation: 

1/4m 

And we know she drank a sixth of the total amount of coffee, so we can write another equation: 

1/6c 

We also know that each family member drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk. Let's call the number of family members "n". Then the total amount of milk and coffee combined is: 

n(8) 

But we know that the amounts of milk and coffee vary from cup to cup and are never zero, so we can write: 

m + c = n(8) 

Now we have three equations: 

1/4m = Angela's milk 
1/6c = Angela's coffee 
m + c = n(8) 

We can use algebra to solve for "n". Let's start by simplifying the equations for Angela's milk and coffee: 

1/4m = Angela's milk 
m/4 = Angela's milk 

1/6c = Angela's coffee 
c/6 = Angela's coffee 

Now we can substitute these expressions into the equation for the total amount of milk and coffee: 

m + c = n(8) 

m/4 + c/6 = n(8) 

Multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 4 and 6 (which is 12), we get: 

3m + 2c = 96n 

Now we have one equation with only "n" as the unknown: 

3m + 2c = 96n 

We can solve for "n" by dividing both sides by 96: 

3m/96 + 2c/96 = n 

n = 1/32(3m + 2c) 

This tells us that the number of family members, "n", is equal to one thirty-second of the sum of three times the total amount of milk and two times the total amount of coffee. 

At this point, we don't know the actual values of "m" and "c", so we can't calculate "n" directly. However, we can make some observations about the problem to narrow down the possibilities. 

First of all, we know that the amounts of milk and coffee are never zero, so "m" and "c" are both positive. 

Secondly, we know that "n" must be a whole number, since it represents the number of family members. This means that 3m + 2c must be divisible by 32. 

We can start by looking for small values of "m" and "c" that satisfy this condition. For example, if we let m = 4 and c = 8, then: 

3m + 2c = 3(4) + 2(8) = 24 

And 24 is divisible by 32, since 32 goes into 24 zero times with a remainder of 24. 

So in this case, the number of family members would be: 

n = 1/32(3m + 2c) = 1/32(24) = 3/4 

However, this is not a whole number, so it doesn't work. 

We can try some other values of "m" and "c" to see if we can find a solution that works. For example, if we let m = 8 and c = 12, then: 

3m + 2c = 3(8) + 2(12) = 36 

And 36 is divisible by 32, since 32 goes into 36 once with a remainder of 4. 

So in this case, the number of family members would be: 

n = 1/32(3m + 2c) = 1/32(36) = 9/4 

Again, this is not a whole number, so it doesn't work. 

We can keep trying different values of "m" and "c" until we find a combination that works. However, we can also make use of the fact that the problem has a unique solution. This means that there is only one possible value of "n" that satisfies all the equations. 

To see why this is true, suppose we have two different values of "n", say "n1" and "n2", that both satisfy the equation: 

3m + 2c = 96n 

Then we have: 

1/32(3m + 2c) = n1 

1/32(3m + 2c) = n2 

Multiplying both sides by 32, we get: 

3m + 2c = 32n1 

3m + 2c = 32n2 

Subtracting these equations, we get: 

2c - 2c = 32n1 - 32n2 

0 = 32(n1 - n2) 

This implies that n1 - n2 = 0, since 32 is not zero. Therefore, we must have n1 = n2, which means there is only one possible value of "n" that satisfies the equations. 

We can use this fact to narrow down the possibilities for "m" and "c". For example, if we find one solution that works, say m = 8 and c = 12, then we know that this is the only possible solution. 

Therefore, we can conclude that there are 9 members in Angela's family.

Thank you for your confidence! 

To find the remainder when $5^{30}$ is divided by 7, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. In this case, $p=7$, and since 5 is not divisible by 7, we have $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

So $5^{30} = (5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \pmod{7} \equiv \boxed{1} \pmod{7}$.

Since $697 = 12 \cdot 58 + 1$, each Martian year consists of 58 weeks and a day.  Therefore, for every year that passes, the first day of the year shifts to the next day of the week.  Since year 0 begins on the first day, year 1 begins on the second day, then year 2 begins on the third day, and so on.  A week consists of 12 days, so the next year that begins on the first day again will be year $\boxed{12}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first note that the total number of weeks in a Martian year is $697/12 \approx 58.$ Noting that $7$ divides $697$ leaves one day over, so year $1$ begins on the day of the week exactly one day later than year $0,$ and we can keep track of which day of the week the first day of each year falls on. After every $7\cdot 12=84$ days, we return to the same day of the week, which is $\gcd(84,58)=2$ days after the beginning of year $0.$ Therefore, the days of the week cycle through year $0$, year $1$, and show no sign of lining up; however, we will reach the same day of the week for the beginning of the year after $58 \cdot 12$ days $= 696$ days, or one day short of a Martian year, which would be the beginning of year $2.$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{2}$.

To find the units digit (the rightmost digit) of a number, we only need to consider the last digit of each of its summands. We can use this trick to simplify the problem.

The units digit of the square of any integer depends only on the units digit of the integer itself. Here are the squares of the first nine positive integers, with their units digits in parentheses:

1 (1), 4 (6), 9 (1), 16 (6), 25 (5), 36 (6), 49 (1), 64 (4), 81 (1)

Now we add up the units digits of these squares: 1 + 6 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 31

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). Since 7 is prime and 5 is not divisible by 7, we have:

5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)

Multiplying both sides by 166666:

5^999996 ≡ 1 (mod 7)

Therefore:

5^999999 = 5^999996 * 5^3 ≡ 1 * 125 ≡ 6 (mod 7)

So the remainder when 5^999999 is divided by 7 is 6.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.

If the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is
\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \dotsm (e_n + 1).\]Note that $e_i \ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.

If $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$

Otherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:
\[20 = 2 \cdot 10 = 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5.\]Thus, we have the following cases:

(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$

(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\cdot3.$

(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3^3=432.$

(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3\cdot5=240.$

Therefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\boxed{240}$ tiles.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the square tile have side length $s$. Then the area of all the rectangular figures Emma makes is $s^2$, since each rectangular figure contains $s^2$ square units. Since there are ten different figures, and each contains the same number of square units, Emma must have at least $10s^2$ square tiles. It remains to show that for some $s$, Emma can arrange $10s^2$ tiles to form the ten rectangular figures.

It follows that the total number of tiles must be a multiple of $10$, say $10k$. In this case, there are $k$ distinct pairs of the form $(m,n)$ where $mn=k$. One of these pairs must have $m+n$ minimized, and we claim that this minimized value is achievable.

To see this, let $\frac{k}{mn}$ square tiles form a rectangle of dimensions $m\times n$. Consider the quantity $|m-n|$. We show that if $|m-n|>1$, then there is another rectangle that can be formed with at least the same efficiency (using all $k$ squares) and with $m+n$ strictly smaller. Without loss of generality, suppose $m>n$. Let $m=n+x$ for some integer $x\geq 2$. Then
\begin{align*}
mn&=n(n+x)=n^2+nx\\
\frac{10k}{mn}&=\frac{10k}{n^2+nx}
\end{align*}which means we must have
\begin{align*}
10k &\mid n^2+nx\\
&\Rightarrow\qquad n^2+nx=tk \quad\mbox{for some integer }t.
\end{align*}Suppose $n=km$ for some integer $m$. Then we have
\begin{align*}
k^2m^2 +kxm &= tk\\
\Rightarrow\qquad n+kx &= tm.
\end{align*}Since $t$ and $k$ are integers, we see that $m$ is an integer as well. Thus, we have found another pair $(m',n')$ where $m'+n'<m+n$, which contradicts the minimality assumption of $m+n$. By iterating this process, we see that we must have $|m-n|=1$, or equivalently, that the two integers $m$ and $n$ differ exactly by $1$.

Therefore, either $m=n$ or $n=m-1$. In either case, $\frac{10k}{mn}$ is an integer, and it's easy to check that in either case, ten distinct rectangles can be formed, which means that Emma can achieve all ten rectangles with $10k$ tiles, where $k=mn$ or $k=(m-1)n$, respectively. Therefore, the smallest number of tiles Emma can have is $10k=\boxed{360}$.

Recall the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Thus, $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{\gcd(9999,100001)},$$so we focus on computing $\gcd(9999,100001)$.

Notice that $100001 = 99990+11 = 10(9999)+11$. Therefore, any common divisor of $100001$ and $9999$ must be a divisor of $100001-10\cdot 9999 = 11$. The possibilities are $1$ and $11$.

In fact, $9999=11\cdot 909$, so $11$ is a divisor of $9999$ and $100001$, which gives $\gcd(9999,100001) = 11$.

Therefore, \begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] &= \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{11} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Since Arnold watered his plants on Tuesday, he will water them next on  Tuesday, 9 days later. Similarly, he will feed them next on Tuesday, 60 days later. The next time he'll feed them and water them on the same day will be the next time these two days overlap. To find this day, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 60. 

The prime factorization of 9 is 3 x 3, and the prime factorization of 60 is 2 x 2 x 3 x 5. We take the highest power of each prime factor with repetition and get: 

LCM(9, 60) = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 5 = 180

So the next time Arnold will water and feed his cactus plants on the same day will be 180 days after the last time he did. From Tuesday, this is equivalent to 25 weeks and 5 days later. Therefore, the day of the week will be Tuesday + 25 weeks and 5 days = $\boxed{\text{Sunday}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To convert a number from base 4 to base 10, we need to multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 4 and add the results. We start from the rightmost digit and the power of 4 is increased by 1 for each subsequent digit. Thus, 

\begin{align*}
1230_{4} &= 0\times4^{0} + 3\times4^{1} + 2\times4^{2} + 1\times4^{3}\\
&= 0 + 3\times4 + 2\times16 + 1\times64\\
&= 0 + 12 + 32 + 64\\

First, we find $A$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $2^2 \cdot 5^3$. Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.

Now we prime factorize $7 \cdot 156 = 7 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\boxed{25}$.

First, we know that $x$ is even. Every prime number larger than $3$ is odd, so the sum of three members has to be even.

Now, $12$ does not work because $(2+10+12)+1=25$, which is not prime.

Similarly, $14$ does not work because $(2+4+14)+1=21$, which is not prime.

But $16$ works because all the possible sums involving $x=16$ generate prime results: $(2+4+16)+1=23$, $(2+10+16)+1=29$, and $(4+10+16)+1=31$.

So the smallest possible value of $x$ is $\boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We proceed by testing values of $x$. Since the set contains even integers, the sum of any three members of the set must be even, which means that the added $1$ must make the sum odd. Therefore, one of the three integers being added must be odd. The only even prime number is $2$, which can only be obtained by adding $1$ to the sum of the odd integer with two other even integers. The smallest odd integer greater than $10$ is $11$, so we test $x=12$. 

If $x=12$, we must add $1$ to the sum of three of the other integers in the set to obtain a prime. Notice that $2+4+11=17$, which is prime, and $2+4+10=16$, which equals $2\times 8$. Therefore, we need to add $1$ to $11$ and $10$ when they are added to $2$ or $4$. However, $2+4+12$ equals $2\times 9$ and adding $1$ would yield an even number. Thus, $x=12$ does not work. 

If $x=14$, we must add $1$ to the sum of three of the other integers in the set to obtain a prime. Notice that $2+4+11=17$, which is prime, and $2+4+10=16$, which equals $2\times 8$. Therefore, we need to add $1$ to either $11$ or $10$ when they are added to $2$ or $4$. The only combination that works is $2+4+15=21$. Adding $1$ yields $22$, which is not prime. Therefore, $x=14$ does not work. 

If $x=16$, we must add $1$ to the sum of three of the other integers in the set to obtain a prime. Notice that $2+4+11=17$, which is prime, and $2+4+10=16$, which equals $2\times 8$. Therefore, we need to add $1$ to either $11$ or $10$ when they are added to $2$ or $4$. The only combination that works is $4+10+17=31$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{16}$.

Let $n$ be the integer in question. Because $n$ has exactly $2$ digits in base-$6$, we have $6^1 \le n < 6^2$. Therefore, $n$ is in the range $[6, 35]$ in decimal notation. In order for $n$ to have exactly $4$ digits in its base-$3$ representation, we must have $3^3\le n < 3^4$. Thus, $n$ is in the range $[27, 81)$, so if $n \ge 35$, then $n$ has at least $5$ digits in its base-$3$ representation, a contradiction. We now count the number of $n$ in the range $[6, 34]$. For every one of the $3^2=9$ base-$6$ two-digit numbers, we have $3^2=9$ choices for the hundreds digit in base-$3$, and $3$ choices each for the tens and ones digits. This gives a total of $9\cdot 3^2\cdot 3^2 = \boxed{2430}$ possible values of $n$.

Since $B+A=10_7$, then $A+B+1=11_7$ and $A$ represents the digit 1. That tells us that $B+1=7$, so $B$ represents the digit 6. The product of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We start by examining the rightmost column of digits. Since $B$ and $A$ are digits, the sum $B+A$ must end in $0$. Therefore, $B$ and $A$ must have the same parity (i.e. they are both odd or both even). Since they are distinct digits, the only possible values for $B$ and $A$ are $2$ and $8$ in some order.

If $B=2$ and $A=8$, then the carry-over to the next column would be $1$, but there is no way to obtain a $1$ from the sum $2+8=10$ in the middle column.

Therefore, $B=8$ and $A=2$, and we have the following addition problem:

\[\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & & 2 & 8_7\\ &+ & & & 8 & 2_7\\ \cline{2-6} & & & 2 & 2 & 0_7\\ \end{array}\]

Now we look at the second column from the right. Since there was be no carry-over, we have $B+ A_7 = 2 \implies B + 1 = 2 \implies B = 1$. But $B$ is a digit, so this is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution with distinct values of $A$ and $B$.

If we allow $A=B$, then we have the following addition problem:

\[\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & & & A & A_7\\ &+ & & & A & A_7\\ \cline{2-6} & & & 2A & (A+1)_7 & 0_7\\ \end{array}\]

From the rightmost column, we already know that $2A$ ends in $0$, so $A$ must be $0$ or $5$. If $A=0$, then the sum in the middle column would be $0$, but that would require $A+1=7$, which is impossible. Therefore, $A=5$, and the sum in the middle column is $1+5+5=11$. This gives $A+1=6$, so $B=A=5$. The product $A\times B = 5\times 5=\boxed{25}$.

We first look at the hundreds place. Since $E\ne G$, it must be that $E+1=G$ in order to get $G$ in the hundreds place. Since a $1$ is carried over, we have $G+G=10+M$. Now we look at the units place. Either $M+M=M$ or $M+M=10+M$. In the second case, $2M=10+M\qquad\Rightarrow M=10$, which is not a possible digit. So it must be that $2M=M$, which is only possible if $M=0$. Now $2G=10\qquad\Rightarrow G=5$ and $E+1=G\qquad\Rightarrow E=4$. The numerical value of $E$ is $\boxed{4}$. We can check that $450+50=500$, which matches the digits in the addition problem.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by observing that there are at most two possible values for $G$ and $M$: $$\begin{array}{r c c c r c c}
& & & G & M & M & \\
+ & & G & M & & & \\
\cline{2-7}
& & (G+1) & (2M+M_i)& M+10K & M_i & \\
\end{array}$$where $K$ is $0$ or $1$ (the carry from the hundreds place) and $M_i$ is either $0$ or $1$ (the carry from the units place). Since $G+1$ has only one digit, we must have $G=8$ or $9$ (since all digits are distinct), so we will test the two cases.

Case $G=9$:
$$\begin{array}{r c c c r c c}
& & & 9 & M & M & \\
+ & & 9 & M & & & \\
\cline{2-7}
& & 1 & (2M+M_i-10)& M+10K+1 & M_i & \\
\end{array}$$Note that $2M+M_i-10$ is either $M+12$ or $M+13$. Thus $M_i$ must be $1$. Furthermore, we can't have $M=0$ since the $1$ in the thousands place would need to be carried up, so we have $$\begin{array}{r c c c r c c}
& & & 9 & 1 & 3 & \\
+ & & 9 & 3 & & & \\
\cline{2-7}
& & 1 & 2& 4 & 1 & \\
\end{array}$$and so $E=4$.

Case $G=8$:
$$\begin{array}{r c c c r c c}
& & & 8 & M & M & \\
+ & & 8 & M & & & \\
\cline{2-7}
& & 1 & (2M+M_i)& M+10K & M_i & \\
\end{array}$$Note that $2M+M_i$ is either $M+10$ or $M+11$. Thus $M_i$ must be $0$. Furthermore, we can't have $M=1$ since the $1$ in the thousands place would need to be carried up, so we have $$\begin{array}{r c c c r c c}
& & & 8 & 3 & 3 & \\
+ & & 8 & 4 & & & \\
\cline{2-7}
& & 1 & 2 & 7 & 0 & \\
\end{array}$$and so $E=2$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{2 \text{ or } 4}$ (since we had two possible cases for $G$, there are two possible values for $E$).

Extracting Answer from: 
First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \cdot 10$ palindromes.

Next, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.

Now we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$

Therefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$

Since there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\frac{10}{90}=\boxed{\frac19}$.

A four-digit palindrome can be written in the form $\underline{abba},$ where $a$ and $b$ are digits. Seeing that $1001=7\times11\times13,$ we may write \begin{align*}
\underline{abba}&=1000a+100b+10b+a\\
&=1001a+110b\\
&=7\cdot11\cdot13\cdot a+2\cdot5\cdot11\cdot b.
\end{align*}Thus $\underline{abba}$ is a multiple of $99$ if and only if $7a+2b$ is a multiple of $11.$ Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, $a$ must be one of $1,$ $2,$ $\ldots,$ $9.$ For each value of $a,$ there are exactly two values of $b$ (namely $5$ and $10$-$a$) that satisfy the divisibility condition, so there are $2\cdot9=18$ four-digit palindromes that are multiples of $99.$ Since there are $9\cdot10=90$ four-digit palindromes in all, the probability that a randomly selected four-digit palindrome is a multiple of $99$ is $\boxed{\frac{1}{5}}.$

We know that $X$ is $2$ more than a multiple of $3,$ so $X\equiv 2\pmod 3.$ In order for $X$ to have the same units digit as a number that is $4$ more than a multiple of $5,$ we know that the units digit of $X$ must be $6$ or $1$ (since the units digit of a multiple of $5$ is either $0$ or $5$). 

If the units digit of $X$ is $6,$ then we know that $X=3a+2=10b+4,$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b,$ since $X$ is two more than a multiple of $3$ and four more than a multiple of $5.$ Solving for $a$ in terms of $b,$ we get $a = \frac{10b+2}{3}.$ However, since both $a$ and $b$ are integers, $10b+2$ must be a multiple of $3,$ which is impossible since $10b$ is always one more than a multiple of $3.$ Thus, the units digit of $X$ must be $1.$

If the units digit of $X$ is $1,$ then we know that $X=3a+2=10b+5.$ We subtract $2$ from both sides to get $10b=3a+3=3(a+1).$ Thus, $a+1$ must be a multiple of $10.$ The smallest such value of $a$ is $9,$ which gives us that $X=3\cdot9+2=\boxed{29}.$

If an integer $x$ is invertible modulo $2^n$, then $x$ and $2^n - x$ are invertible, since their product is $2^n$, whose only factors are $2$. We have $2$ choices for each of the $n-1$ middle digits of a binary number less than $2^n$, but we must exclude $2^{n-1}$ since it is not invertible. Thus, $k = 2^{n-1} - 1$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the ones digit of $35^{12}$, we need to consider the pattern of the ones digit of each power of 35. 

$35^1$ ends in $5$.

$35^2$ ends in $5\times 5 = 25$.

$35^3$ ends in $5\times 5\times 3 = 75$, which has a ones digit of $5$.

$35^4$ ends in $5\times 5\times 5\times 5 = 625$, which has a ones digit of $5$.

We see that the ones digit of each power of 35 is 5, 5, 5, 5, and so on. This pattern will keep repeating itself, since the ones digit only depends on the last digit of the base, which is 5. Since $12$ is a multiple of $4$, the ones digit of $35^{12}$ is $\boxed{5}$.

16A+4B+C+200&=81A+9B+C\quad\Rightarrow\\
200&=65A+5B.
\end{align*}Notice that the $C$ cancels out on both sides, so $C$ could be any valid digit that works in both base 4 and 9 (0, 1, 2, 3). Now we maximize $A$ with $A=3$ and solve $200=65(3)+5B$ to get $B=1$. If we take any smaller value for $A$, then $B$ will be too large to be a digit. So there is only one value of $A$, one value of $B$, and four possible values for $C$. The sum is $3+1+0+1+2+3=\boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we can translate the equation into base 10 to get $64A+16B+C+200=729A+81B+9C$. This simplifies to $665A+65B-8C=200$. Since $A$ and $B$ can only be digits in base 4 and 9, respectively, we know that $A$ can be at most 3 and $B$ can be at most 8. Also note that $665A$ is divisible by 5, so $65B$ must also be divisible by 5 in order for $665A+65B$ to be divisible by 5. This means $B$ can only be 0 or 5.

Case 1: $B=0$
Plugging this into the original equation, we get $64A+C+200=729A-8C$. Rearranging this gives $(8A+5)(13A-2)=9C-400$. Since $C$ is at most 8 in base 9, $9C-400$ is at most 8 when equal to 8, 17, or 26. Testing each of these cases leads to no valid solutions.

Case 2: $B=5$
Plugging this into the original equation, we get $64A+C+200=3645A-72C$. Rearranging this gives $(33A+20)(11A-2)=9C-400$. Since $C$ is at most 8 in base 9, $9C-400$ is at most 8 when equal to 44 or 53. Testing these cases gives $A=1$, $C=4$ or $A=2$, $C=7$.

Thus, the possible values of $(A, B, C)$ are $(1, 5, 4)$ and $(2, 5, 7)$, and their sum is $1+2+5+4+7=\boxed{19}$.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/number_theory/679_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We start by adding up the amount of money earned by each girl.

\begin{align*}
\$27.47 &+ \$35.23 + \$37.37 + \$26.52 \\
&= \$126.59
\end{align*}

Next, we convert this to cents.

\begin{align*}
\$126.59 &= 126\text{ dollars and }59\text{ cents} \\
&= 126 \times 100 + 59 \\
&= 12,\!659\text{ cents}
\end{align*}

We don't know the exact number and denominations of the coins, but we do know that the maximum number of coins that can be converted to bills is 99 pennies, 24 nickels, 9 dimes, and 4 quarters (since 100 pennies, 25 nickels, 10 dimes, and 5 quarters all convert to bills).

Let $p$, $n$, $d$, and $q$ be the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters, respectively. Then we have the following system of inequalities.

\begin{align*}
p &\leq 99 \\
5n &\leq 24 \\
10d &\leq 9 \\
25q &\leq 4(10000 - 12659) \\
q &\leq 154
\end{align*}

The last inequality uses the fact that the total amount of money, in cents, before conversion to bills was $10000 - 12659 = -2659$, so we need at least 26.59 dollars' worth of quarters to convert as many coins as possible to bills.

We want to maximize the value of $p + 5n + 10d + 25q$. The largest possible value of $q$ is 154, so we start there and work backwards.

\begin{align*}
25 \cdot 154 &= 3850 \\
10000 - 12659 - 3850 &= 2881
\end{align*}

We can't use any more quarters, so we move on to dimes.

\begin{align*}
10 \cdot 9 &= 90 \\
2881 - 90 &= 2791
\end{align*}

We can't use any more dimes, so we move on to nickels.

\begin{align*}
5 \cdot 24 &= 120 \\
2791 - 120 &= 2671
\end{align*}

We have one penny left (since 2671 is not divisible by 5), so our final answer is:

\begin{align*}
p + 5n + 10d + 25q &= 1 + 5 \cdot 24 + 10 \cdot 9 + 25 \cdot 154 \\
&= 1 + 120 + 90 + 3850 \\

Let's start by finding the proper divisors of 284. The prime factorization of 284 is $2^2 \cdot 71$, so the divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, 142, and 284. The proper divisors are therefore 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142. Their sum is $1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220$. 

Now we need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 220. The prime factorization of 220 is $2^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$, so its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110. The proper divisors are everything except 220, so their sum is $1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 = 174$.

We use the property that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$.

Since $129 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$ and $96 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$, we have  $$129^{34}+96^{38} \equiv (-3)^{34}+(-3)^{38} \equiv 3^{34}+3^{38} \pmod{11}.$$Since $3^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{11},$ we can see that $3^{34} = (3^5)^{6} \cdot 3^4$ and $3^{38} = (3^5)^{7} \cdot 3^3.$

By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have $129^{10}\equiv 1 \pmod{11}$ and $96^{10}\equiv 1\pmod{11}$. Therefore, we have $129^{34}\equiv (129^{10})^3\cdot 129^4\equiv 129^4\equiv 4^4\equiv 5\pmod{11}$. Similarly, we have $96^{38}\equiv (96^{10})^3\cdot 96^8\equiv 96^8\equiv (100-4)^4\equiv 4^4\equiv 5\pmod{11}$. Thus, the remainder when $129^{34}+96^{38}$ is divided by $11$ is $5+5=\boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can simplify the expression as follows:

\begin{align*}
2^{2001} \times 5^{1950} \div 4^{27} &= 2^{2001} \times 5^{1950} \div (2^2)^{27} \\
&= 2^{2001} \times 5^{1950} \div 2^{54} \\
&= 2^{2001-54} \times 5^{1950} \\
&= 2^{1947} \times 5^{1950} \\
\end{align*}

To find the number of digits in this expression, we can take the logarithm (base 10) of the expression and add 1. This gives us the number of digits in the expression.

\begin{align*}
\log_{10}(2^{1947} \times 5^{1950}) + 1 &= \log_{10}(2^{1947}) + \log_{10}(5^{1950}) + 1 \\
&= 1947\log_{10}(2) + 1950\log_{10}(5) + 1 \\
&\approx 585.18 + 894.67 + 1 \\
&= 1481.85 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the value of the expression has 1482 digits.

We can write out what $11011_b$ means in terms of powers of $b$: $$11011_b = b^4+b^3+b+1.$$Multiplying this by $b-1$ gives \begin{align*}
11011_b &= (b-1)b^4 + (b-1)b^3 + (b-1)b + (b-1) \\
&= b^5 - b^4 + b^4 - b^3 + b^2 - b + b - 1 \\
&= b^5 - b^3 + b^2 - 1.
\end{align*}Now $$1001_b = b^3 + 1,$$so when we add this to the result above, we get $b^5+b^2$, which is written in base $b$ as $\boxed{100100}$.

Instead of taking this algebraic approach, you can also think in terms of base-$b$ long arithmetic (note that each $(b-1)$ below represents a single digit): $$\begin{array}{r *5{c@{~}}c}

\hline
& 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/number_theory/814_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can first find the value of the base-$b$ number $11011_b$ by expressing it in decimal form:
\begin{align*}
11011_b &= 1\cdot b^4 + 1\cdot b^3 + 0\cdot b^2 + 1\cdot b^1 + 1\cdot b^0 \\
&= b^4 + b^3 + b + 1.
\end{align*}
When we multiply $11011_b$ by $b-1$, we get
\begin{align*}
&(b-1)\cdot(b^4+b^3+b+1) \\
&= b\cdot(b^4+b^3+b+1) - (b^4+b^3+b+1) \\
&= b^5 + b^4 + b^2 + b - b^4 - b^3 - b - 1 \\
&= b^5 - b^3 + b^2 - 1.
\end{align*}
Adding the base-$b$ number $1001_b$ to this result gives:
\begin{align*}
&(b^5 - b^3 + b^2 - 1) + (b^3 + 1) \\
&= b^5 + b^2 + 2b - 1.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the final result is $\boxed{b^5 + b^2 + 2b - 1}$ in base $b$.

We know that each month has a maximum of $31$ days, and therefore, the tens digit of the day ranges from $0$ to $3$. It is easy to see that only $3$ months have a tens digit of $3$ in at least one of the days of the month: March, April, and May. 

For March, we have the set of possible days with a tens digit of $3$ as $\{ 03, 13, 23, 30 \}$. There are $4$ such days.

For April, we have the set of possible days as $\{ 03, 13, 23 \}$, which has $3$ possible days.

For May, we have $\{ 03, 13, 23, 31 \}$, which has $4$ possible days.

The primes between 1 and 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

We compute their residues modulo 16: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 1, 3, 7, 13, 15, 5, 9, 11, 15, 5, 11, 13, 3, 7, 9, 15, 3, 9, 1.

We multiply all of these numbers modulo 16, taking advantage of the fact that $3\cdot 5 \equiv -1 (\text{mod }16)$, $7\cdot9\equiv -1 (\text{mod }16)$, $11\cdot 13\equiv -1 (\text{mod }16)$, and $15\equiv -1(\text{mod }16)$. We find that our answer is $\boxed{6}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We need to find the product of all primes from 1 to 100, which is equivalent to finding the product of the primes from 1 to 50 squared. We can use a sieve to find all the primes from 1 to 50:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.

There are 15 primes, so the product of all primes from 1 to 50 is $p = 2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13\cdot17\cdot19\cdot23\cdot29\cdot31\cdot37\cdot41\cdot43\cdot47$.

Now we need to find the remainder of $p$ when divided by 16. Let's compute $p$ modulo 8 and 2 separately, using the fact that $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ implies $ac \equiv bc \pmod{n}$:

- $p \equiv 1\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7\cdot3\cdot5\cdot1\cdot3\cdot7\cdot5\cdot7\cdot1\cdot1\cdot11\cdot15 \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$.
- $p \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$.

Therefore, $p \equiv \boxed{11} \pmod{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We perform the subtraction digit by digit, regrouping as needed. The units digit $1_{11}-2_{11}$ requires regrouping, so we borrow one from the $1$ in the $11$s place in the top number. This becomes $11_{11}$ after borrowing from the $9_{11}$ in the $121_{11}$'s place. Thus we have \begin{align*}
&\begin{array}{@{}c@{\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c}
& &\cancelto{1}{1}&9&1_{11}\\
& -&1&3&9_{11}\\
\cline{2-5}
&& 1&6&2_{11}\\
\end{array}\end{align*} Thus $2911_{11}-1392_{11}=\boxed{162}_{11}$.

Since we know that $5^4=625<700<5^5=3125$, the largest power of 5 that is less than or equal to $700$ is $5^4$. This means that there will be digits in the $5^4$ place, the $5^3$ place, the $5^2$ place, the $5^1$ place, and the $5^0$ place when $700_{10}$ is converted to base 5. Therefore, there will be $\boxed{5\text{ digits}}$ in the base 5 number that corresponds to $700_{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To convert $700_{10}$ to base 5, we repeatedly divide by 5, keeping track of the remainders as the digits in the new base, until the quotient is less than 5. Doing this, we have: $$\begin{array}{c|c|c} \multicolumn{2}{r|}{\text{Division}} & \text{Remainder (digit)} \\ \cline{2-3} 700 & 5 & 0 \\ 140 & 5 & 0 \\ 28 & 5 & 3 \\ 5 & 5 & 0 \\ 1 & & 1 \\ \end{array}$$ So the base 5 representation is $10300_5$. This number has $\boxed{5}$ digits.
