If the stamp's offer price doubles every three years, then in 12 more years, the offer price will double four times.  To double the offer price once, we multiply by $2$, so to double four times, we multiply $1.25$ by $2$ four times: $$1.25\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2=1.25\cdot 16=\boxed{20}.$$ Thus, he will be offered $\$20$ in 12 more years.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by expanding the left side of the equation:$$\begin{aligned} (2x+5)(x-3) &= 2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15 \\ &= 2x^2 - x - 15 \end{aligned}$$So we want to solve the equation $2x^2 - x - 15 = 14$, or equivalently, $2x^2 - x - 29 = 0$. To use the quadratic formula, we have $a=2$, $b=-1$, and $c=-29$. Thus, the solutions are:$$x = \frac{-(-1)\pm\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4\cdot2\cdot(-29)}}{2\cdot2} = \frac{1\pm\sqrt{233}}{4}$$So the sum of the possible values of $x$ is:$$\frac{1+\sqrt{233}}{4} + \frac{1-\sqrt{233}}{4} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$$

Original File: datasets/MATH/MATH/test/algebra/1164.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Since the points $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points.  The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \[a(x-2)^2+k.\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\] or  \[9a+k=0.\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \[5=a(0-2)^2+k\] or  \[4a+k=5.\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.

Since $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\boxed{-55}.\]

We have a system of three equations using the fact that the parabola passes through each point. \begin{align*}
a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c &= 0\\
a(0)^2 + b(0) + c &= 5\\
a(5)^2 + b(5) + c &=0
\end{align*} Simplifying we get,
\begin{align*}
a-b+c &= 0\\
c &= 5\\
25a+5b+c &= 0

Answer from Original: 286

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/algebra/1210_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
The $n$th term of this arithmetic progression is $13+7(n-1)$, so we want to find how many $n$ satisfy $13+7(n-1)\leq 2008 < 13+7n$.

Simplifying, that inequality becomes $7n-6\leq 286<n+4$, or $7n\leq 292<n+10$. Since $7n$ is always a multiple of 7, we must have $n\leq 41\frac{5}{7}$. Meanwhile, $n+10>41$, so $n$ must be at least 42.

To find the sixth term, we add 1010 to the fifth term:
2222, 3232, 4242, 5252, 6262, 7272

So the sixth term is 7272.

To find the seventh term, we add 1010 to the sixth term:
7272 + 1010 = 8282

The sum of the sixth and seventh terms is therefore:

7272 + 8282 = 15554

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's first solve for $x$ in the first equation $18x^2+25x-3=0$ by factoring or using the quadratic formula:

\begin{align*}
18x^2+25x-3 &= (6x-1)(3x+3)\\
&=0
\end{align*}

This gives us two possible values of $x$: $x=\frac16$ or $x=-1$.

Now we can check whether either of these values satisfy the second equation $4x^2+8x+3=0$:

\begin{align*}
4\left(\frac16\right)^2+8\left(\frac16\right)+3 &= \frac{4}{36} + \frac{8}{6} + 3 = \frac13 + \frac{24}{3} + 3 = 0\\
4(-1)^2+8(-1)+3 &= 4 - 8 + 3 = -1 \neq 0
\end{align*}

So the only value of $x$ that satisfies both equations is $\boxed{\frac16}$.

real g(real x)

{

return -x^2+8.75;

}

draw(graph(g,-3,3), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

We first find the $x$ values at which the two equations intersect. When $x\ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$. Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}\Rightarrow x^2+x-\frac{35}{4}=0$. Factoring the left hand side gives $\left(x+\frac{7}{2}\right)\left(x-\frac{5}{2}\right)=0$, so $x=2.5$ (since we stated that $x$ was non-negative). By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2.5$. So we just have to consider the integer $x$ values between these two bounds and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.

For $x=-2$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=2$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{19}{4}=4.75$, so all $y$ values between 2 and 4 inclusive work, for a total of 3 points. For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{31}{4}=7.75$, so all $y$ values between 1 and 7 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points. For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{35}{4}=8.75$, so all $y$ values between 0 and 8 inclusive work, for a total of 9 points. By symmetry, when $x=1$, there are 7 points that work, and when $x=2$, there are 3 points that work.

In total, there are $3+7+9+7+3=\boxed{29}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary.

First we find the x-intercepts of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ by setting $y=0$, giving $x=\pm\frac 52$. Therefore, the lattice points on the boundary consist of $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,0)$, $(-1,1)$, and $(-2,0)$.

Now we need to count the lattice points inside the region. Consider a horizontal line $y=k$, where $k$ is an integer. If $k\geq 0$, then the number of lattice points on this line that are inside the region is $k+1$ (from $x=-k$ to $x=k$). If $k<0$, then the number of lattice points on the line that are inside the region is $1$ (the origin). Therefore, the total number of lattice points inside the region is:

Extracting Answer from: 
To solve this problem, we can use the method of elimination. We will add the three given equations to eliminate one of the variables, and then we will substitute the remaining values to find the value of $abc$.

Adding the three equations, we get:

$(a+b) + (b+c) + (a+c) = 8 - 3 - 5$

Simplifying both sides, we get:

$2a+2b+2c = 0$

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

$a+b+c=0$

Now we can substitute $c = -a-b$ into the second equation $b+c=-3$, to get: 

$b + (-a-b) = -3$

Simplifying, we get:

$a+2b=3$

Finally, we substitute $c = -a-b$ and $a+b=8-c$ into the third equation $a+c=-5$, to get:

$a + (-a-b) = -5$

Simplifying, we get:

$b-5=-c$

Substituting $c=-a-b$ again, we get:

$b-5=a+b$

Substituting $a+b=8-c$ again, we get:

$b-5=8-c$

Substituting $c=-a-b$ one last time, we get:

$b-5 = 8+a+b$

Simplifying, we get:

$a = -13$

Now, we can substitute $a=-13$ into $a+b=8-c$ to find $b$.

$a+b=8-c$

$-13+b=8-(-a-b)$

$b+13=8+a+b$

$b+13=8-13$

$b=-5$

Finally, we can substitute $a=-13$, $b=-5$, and $c=-a-b=18$ into the expression $abc$ to get:

$abc = (-13)(-5)(18) = 1170$

Thus, the value of the product $abc$ is $\boxed{1170}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The distance between the points $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$ is $\sqrt{(-4-1)^2 + (10+2)^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = 13.$

Since the two points are adjacent vertices of a square, the other two vertices must be found by moving the same distance away from each of these points at right angles to the line connecting them.

To find the coordinates of these two points, we can use the fact that the slope of the line connecting $(1,-2)$ and $(-4,10)$ is $-2,$ so the slopes of lines perpendicular to it are $\frac{1}{2}.$

One of the points is $\left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 13, -2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 13\right) = (-2,-28),$ and the other point is $\left(-4 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 13, 10 + \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot 13\right) = (7,-6).$

Thus, the side length of the square is the distance between $(1,-2)$ and $(-2,-28),$ which is $\sqrt{(-2-1)^2 + (-28+2)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 26^2} = \sqrt{685}.$ The perimeter of the square is $4\sqrt{685}.$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{4\sqrt{685}}.$

The points of intersection of the line $y = 7$ and $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$, by substitution, are found when $2x^2 + 8x + 4 = 7 \Longrightarrow 2x^2 + 8x - 3 = 0$. By the quadratic formula, $$x = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-3)}}{2 \cdot 2}.$$We want to find the difference of these roots to find the difference of the x-coordinates of the point of intersection, which will give a side length of the square. The difference is given by $\frac{\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-3)}}2 = \frac{\sqrt{88}}{2} = \sqrt{22}$. Thus, the area of the square is $\boxed{22}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the square has a side on the line $y=7$, one of its vertices is $(a,7)$ for some $a$. Since the other side of the square lies on the parabola $y = 2x^2 + 8x + 4$, it passes through a point on this parabola - call the point $(b, 2b^2 + 8b + 4)$. Since the square has four sides of equal length, there is a second vertex on the line $y=7$ that is a distance $\sqrt{(b-a)^2 + (2b^2 + 8b - 3)^2}$ from $(a,7)$.

By the distance formula, the distance between the two points $(a,7)$ and $(b, 2b^2 + 8b + 4)$ is $\sqrt{(b-a)^2 + (2b^2 + 8b - 3)^2}$. Since the opposite sides of a square are parallel and of equal length, we know that the perpendicular distance between the lines $y=7$ and $y=2x^2+8x+4$ must be the same at both of the square's vertices. The perpendicular distance between these lines is $\left|(2)(a)-8 - 1\right|/\sqrt{2}$ at the vertex $(a,7)$ and $\left|(2)(b)-8 - 1\right|/\sqrt{2}$ at the vertex $(b,2b^2+8b+4)$. Hence we have
$$\frac{\left|(2)(a)-8 - 1\right|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\left|(2)(b)-8 - 1\right|}{\sqrt{2}}.$$Multiplying by $\sqrt{2}$ and simplifying gives
$$\left|2a - 9\right| = \left|2b-9\right|.$$By symmetry, the side length of the square is $|2a-9|$. We need to find $|2a-9|$.

If $2a - 9 \ge 0$ then $a \ge \frac{9}{2}$; if $2a - 9 < 0$ then $a < \frac{9}{2}$. If $a \ge \frac{9}{2}$ then $b$ satisfies 
\begin{align*}
2b^2 + 8b + 4 &= 7 \\
0 &= 2(b^2 + 4b - 1) \\
b &= -2 \pm \sqrt{5},
\end{align*}but both of these values make $2a-9$ negative, which means that they don't satisfy $2a-9\ge 0$. If $a < \frac{9}2$ then $b$ satisfies
\begin{align*}
2b^2 + 8b + 4 &= 7 \\
2b^2 + 8b - 3 &= 0\\
b &= \frac{-8\pm\sqrt{8^2-4(2)(-3)}}{4}\\
&= -1 \text{ or } \frac{3}{2}.
\end{align*}
The second root yields a positive value of $2a-9$. Therefore, if $a < \frac{9}{2}$, the side length of the square is $|2\cdot \frac32 - 9| = \frac32$, and if $a \ge \frac{9}{2}$, there is no possible square, so the area of the square is $\boxed{0}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the minimum height, we need to find the vertex of the parabola. We can do this by finding the $t$-value of the vertex, which is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

In this case, $a=2$ and $b=-5$, so the $t$-value of the vertex is:

$$t = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-5}{2(2)} = \frac{5}{4}$$

To find the minimum height, we substitute this value into the equation:

$$2\left(\frac{5}{4}\right)^2 - 5\left(\frac{5}{4}\right) + 29 \approx 28\text{ feet}$$

Therefore, Ben's minimum height off the ground is approximately $28$ feet.

Let the number of rides Simon paid for be $x$. Then, the total cost for Simon can be represented as:

\begin{align*}
\text{total cost} &= \text{entry fee} + \text{cost of rides} \\
&= 2.25 + 1.5x \\
\end{align*}

We know that the total cost is $\$12.75$, so we can write an equation:

\begin{align*}
2.25 + 1.5x &= 12.75 \\
1.5x &= 10.5 \\
x &= 7 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, Simon paid for 7 rides.

Setting $x = 0,$ we get $f(0) = 9.$ Since $9 > 3,$ $f(9) = 9a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(0)) = f(9) = 9a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $9a + b = 0.$

Setting $x = 1,$ we get $f(1) = 7.$ Since $7 > 3,$ $f(7) = 7a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(1)) = f(7) = 7a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $7a + b = 1.$

Subtracting the equations $9a + b = 0$ and $7a + b = 1,$ we get $2a = -1,$ so $a = -1/2.$ From $9a + b = 0,$ we get $b = -9a = 9/2.$ Hence, $$a + b = -1/2 + (9/2) = \boxed{4}.$$

If $x \leq 3,$ then $f(x) = 9 - 2x$ and $f(f(x)) = f(9 - 2x) = a(9 - 2x) + b.$

If $x > 3,$ then $f(x) = ax+b,$ so $f(f(x)) = a(ax+b) + b = a^2x + ab + b.$

If $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ then $a(9-2x) + b = x$ for $x \leq 3.$ Hence, $-2a = 1$ and $9a + b = 0.$

Also, $a^2 x + ab +b = x$ for $x>3.$ Hence, $a^2=1$ and $ab+b=0.$ Since $a \neq - \frac{1}{2},$ we must have $a = 1.$

Thus, $9a+b = 0$ implies $b=-9,$ giving us that $a+b = \boxed{-8}.$

We focus on the portion of the floor that is left unpainted. After one day, $\frac12$ of the floor is left unpainted. After two days, $\frac1{2^2}$ of the floor is left unpainted, and so on. After $n$ days, $\frac1{2^n}$ of the floor is unpainted. The floor has area $15^2 = 225$ square feet, so we look for the least number of days $n$ when at most $\frac1{225}$ of the floor is left unpainted: \begin{align*}
\frac1{2^n} &\leq \frac1{225}\\

Zeno will initially paint half of the area of the square, which is $(15\times 15)/2 = 112.5$ square feet. The remaining half will have an area of $112.5$ square feet as well, so he will paint half of that the next day, which is $56.25$ square feet. Continuing this pattern, he will paint:

$$112.5, 56.25, 28.125, 14.0625, 7.03125, \ldots$$

square feet on successive days. We see a pattern emerging: he will paint half of the remaining unpainted area each day. So he will paint a total of:

$$\begin{aligned} &112.5 + 56.25 + 28.125 + 14.0625 + 7.03125 + \ldots \\ &= 112.5\left(1+\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{4}+\dfrac{1}{8}+\dfrac{1}{16}+\ldots\right) \end{aligned}$$

square feet. This series is a geometric series with first term $1$ and ratio $1/2$, so its sum is:

$$112.5\left(\dfrac{1}{1-\frac{1}{2}}\right) = \boxed{225}\text{ square feet}$$

Since he finishes the job on the same day he has $1$ square foot or less left, he will finish in $6$ days.

If the given quadratic equation has one solution, it follows that its discriminant must be equal to $0$. The discriminant of the given quadratic is given by $m^2 - 4(m+n)$, and setting this equal to zero, we obtain another quadratic equation $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$. Since the value of $m$ is unique, it follows that again, the discriminant of this quadratic must be equal to zero. The discriminant is now $4^2 - 4(-4n) = 16 + 16n = 0$, so it follows that $n = \boxed{-1}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The quadratic formula tells us that the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$
For the equation $x^2 + mx + (m+n) = 0$, we have $a = 1$, $b = m$, and $c = m+n$. The discriminant is therefore
$$b^2 - 4ac = m^2 - 4(m+n).$$
For there to be only one real root, the discriminant must be equal to 0. That is,
$$m^2 - 4(m+n) = 0.$$
Solving for $n$, we get
\begin{align*}
m^2 - 4(m+n) &= 0 \\
m^2 - 4m - 4n &= 0 \\
4n &= m^2 - 4m \\
n &= \frac{1}{4}m^2 - m \\
n &= \boxed{\frac{1}{4}} \left(m - 2\right)^2 - 1.

As the center of the circle is at the point $(-5,2)$ and its radius is $r$, the equation for the circle is $(x+5)^2+(y-2)^2=r^2$. Expanding this, \begin{align*}
x^2+10x+25+y^2-4y+4 &= r^2 \\
x^2 + y^2+10x-4y &= r^2-29.
\end{align*}Now, this equation must match the form $Ax^2 + 2y^2 + Bx + Cy = 40,$ so we see that we can multiply the above by two so that the coefficients for $y^2$ match: $$2x^2 + 2y^2+20x-8y= 2r^2-58.$$Thus, $A=2$, $B=20$, and $C=-8$. Also, $2r^2-58=40 \Rightarrow 2r^2=98 \Rightarrow r^2=49$. As $r$ is the radius, it must be positive, so $r=7$.
Therefore, $A+B+C+r= 2+20-8+7= \boxed{21}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the center of the circle is $(-5,2),$ we know that $-B/(2A)=-5$ and $-C/(2)=2.$ Hence, $B=10A$ and $C=-4.$

Furthermore, for any point on the circle, we have that the distance to the center is $r.$ That is, $$r^2 = (x + 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2.$$Rearranging gives us $x^2 + 10x + y^2 - 4y = r^2-41.$

Substituting our above values for $B$ and $C$ and collecting terms, we have $$Ax^2+2y^2+10Ax-4y = 40.$$But $Ax^2+2y^2+10Ax-4y = Ax^2+10Ax+2y^2-4y= (x+5)^2+(y-1)^2-51,$ so $$r^2-41=(x+5)^2+(y-1)^2-51,$$or $$r^2=(x+5)^2+(y-1)^2-10.$$Thus, $r^2 = (x + 5)^2 + (y - 2)^2$ and $r^2 = (x + 5)^2 + (y - 1)^2 - 10,$ so $(y - 2)^2 = (y - 1)^2 - 10,$ which simplifies to $y^2 - 6y + 9 = y^2 - 2y - 1$. Therefore, $y = 5$. Plugging $y = 5$ into our previous equations, we find that $x = -5 \pm \sqrt{11}$.

Since the equation of the circle is $Ax^2 + 2y^2 + Bx + Cy = 40$, we have $A(\sqrt{11})^2 + 2(5)^2 + 10A(\sqrt{11}) - 4(5) = 40$. Solving this gives $A = -\frac{1}{11},$ so the equation of the circle can be written as $$-\frac{1}{11}x^2 + 2y^2 +10x - 4y = 40.$$The radius of the circle is $\sqrt{( \sqrt{11}-5)^2 + 25} = 6 - \sqrt{11},$ so the answer is $$A+B+C+r = -\frac{1}{11} + 10\left(-\frac{1}{11}\right) - 4 + 6-\sqrt{11}=\boxed{\frac{73}{11}-\sqrt{11}}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We can begin by solving for $x$ and $y$ in terms of constants. Rearranging the given equations, we have:

\begin{align*}
725x &= 1500 - 727y \\
x &= \frac{1500}{725} - \frac{727}{725}y \\
\\
729x &= 1508 - 731y \\
x &= \frac{1508}{729} - \frac{731}{729}y \\
\end{align*}

Setting the two expressions for $x$ equal to each other, we have:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1500}{725} - \frac{727}{725}y &= \frac{1508}{729} - \frac{731}{729}y \\
\frac{1500 \cdot 729 - 727 \cdot 725}{725 \cdot 729}y &= \frac{1508 \cdot 725 - 731 \cdot 725}{725 \cdot 729} \\
y &= -\frac{8}{4} \\
y &= -2 \\
\end{align*}

Plugging this value of $y$ into either of the equations we were given, we have:

\begin{align*}
725x + 727(-2) &= 1500 \\
725x &= 2954 \\
x &= \frac{2954}{725} \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, $x - y$ is:

\begin{align*}
x - y &= \frac{2954}{725} - (-2) \\
&= \frac{2954}{725} + 2 \\
&= \frac{2954 + 2 \cdot 725}{725} \\
&= \frac{4404}{725} \\
&= \frac{17616}{2900} \\

Let's begin by finding $f(x)$ for $x = 101, 102, \ldots, 110.$ 

If we plug in $x = 101,$ then $\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \sqrt{101} \rfloor = 10.$ So $f(101) = 101 - 10^2 = 1.$ 

If we plug in $x = 102,$ then $\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor = \lfloor \sqrt{102} \rfloor = 10.$ So $f(102) = 102 - 10^2 = 2.$ 

Continuing in this manner, we get:

\begin{align*}
f(103) &= 103 - 10^2 = 3, \\
f(104) &= 104 - 10^2 = 4, \\

The absolute value of the product of two numbers is the product of their absolute values, so we can write  \[
|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|x+4|\,|x-4|.
\]Since $|x^2-16|$ is written as the product of two positive integers, it is composite unless one of the integers is $1$.  Solving $|x+4|=1$, we observe that either $x+4=1$ or $x+4=-1$, which give solutions of $x=-3$ and $x=-5$.  Similarly, solving $|x-4|=1$ we find $x=3$ or $x=5$.

First we bring all the $x$ and $y$ terms to the left, and put all the other terms on the right.  This makes our system \begin{align*} 3x+2y &=8,\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \end{align*}Multiplying the first equation by 2 makes its coefficients of $x$ and $y$ match those of the second equation: \begin{align*} 6x+4y &=16,\\ 6x+4y&= 2a-7. \end{align*}If $2a-7=16$, these equations will be the same, so the system will have infinitely many solutions. If $2a-7$ does not equal 16, then this system will have no solutions, since $6x+4y$ cannot equal two different numbers.  Solving $2a-7=16$ gives us $a=\boxed{\frac{23}{2}}$.

We can start by solving the second equation for $y$: \begin{align*}
6x &= 2a - 7 - 4y\\
4y &= 2a - 7 - 6x \\
y &= \frac{1}{2}a - \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2}x.
\end{align*}

Now we can substitute this expression for $y$ into the first equation and solve for $x$: \begin{align*}
3x + 2 \left( \frac{1}{2}a - \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{2}x \right) &= 8\\
3x + a - 9 - 3x &= 8\\

Let's simplify this expression step by step. 

First, we can simplify the expression inside the first set of parentheses: 

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{3}{2}(4x-6) &= \frac{3}{2}\cdot 4x - \frac{3}{2}\cdot 6 \\ &= 6x - 9\end{aligned}$$ 

So we can rewrite the expression as: 

$$\left(2x + 6x - 9\right) - 4\left(-(2-x) + \frac{x}{2}\right)$$ 

Next, we can distribute the negative sign inside the second set of parentheses: 

$$\left(2x + 6x - 9\right) - 4\left(-2 + x + \frac{x}{2}\right)$$ 

We can simplify the expression inside the second set of parentheses: 

$$-4\left(-2 + x + \frac{x}{2}\right) = -4\left(-2 + \frac{3}{2}x\right) = 8 - 6x$$ 

So now we have: 

$$\left(2x + 6x - 9\right) - (8 - 6x)$$ 

When we distribute the negative sign in front of the second set of parentheses, we need to remember to change the sign of every term inside the parentheses. 

Combining like terms, we get: 

$$8x - 1$$ 

So the simplified expression is $\boxed{8x-1}$.

There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).

The other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \boxed{11}$.

We can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \boxed{11}$.

First, we can simplify the denominator under the radical sign using the fact that $\sqrt{a^2b}=a\sqrt{b}$ for any $a$ and $b$: $$\begin{aligned} 3\sqrt{3}+7\sqrt{27} &= 3\sqrt{3}+7\sqrt{3^3} \\ &= 3\sqrt{3}+7\cdot3\sqrt{3}\\ &=3\sqrt{3}+21\sqrt{3}\\ &= 24\sqrt{3}. \end{aligned}$$ So, our expression becomes $$\frac{8}{3\sqrt{3}+7\sqrt{27}}=\frac{8}{24\sqrt{3}}.$$Finally, we can simplify by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 8:  $$\frac{8}{24\sqrt{3}}=\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}.$$Thus, the simplified and rationalized form of the given expression is $\boxed{\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}}$.

Since these equations look symmetric, at least on the left-hand side, we add all three together.  This gives us  \begin{align*}
&a(x+1+y)+b(y+x+1)+c(1+y+x)\\

\end{align*} We then factor out $(1+x+y)$ on the left and simplify the right side to get \begin{align*}
(1+x+y)(a+b+c)&=7x+7y+7, \text{ so}\\
(1+x+y)(a+b+c)&=7(1+x+y).

Extracting Answer from: 
We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.

Adult tickets sell for $\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.

We now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.

We multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \rightarrow 4y=260 \rightarrow y=65$.

Therefore, $\boxed{65 \text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.

Let $a$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $c$ be the number of children's tickets sold. Then we know that $a+c=100$ and $9a+5c=640$. We want to solve for $c$. 

We can rearrange the first equation to get $a=100-c$. Substituting that into the second equation gives us $9(100-c)+5c=640$. Simplifying gives $900-9c+5c=640$. Combining like terms gives $4c=260$, so $c=\boxed{65}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $\Delta p$ be the original error in momentum measurement and $\Delta x$ be the corresponding minimum error in position measurement. Then we have:

$$\Delta p \cdot \Delta x \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$

Suppose the error in the measurement of momentum is halved, so the new error is $\frac{1}{2}\Delta p$. Let $\Delta x'$ be the corresponding minimum error in position measurement. Then we have:

$$\frac{1}{2}\Delta p \cdot \Delta x' \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$

Dividing the two inequalities, we get:

$$\frac{\Delta x'}{\Delta x} \geq 2$$

So the minimum error in position measurement must increase by at least $100\%$ (or double) when the error in momentum measurement is halved.

We can start by using the given information to set up an equation with one variable. Let $x$ be the number of calories needed to fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement. Then, according to the problem, we have:

$$40 = 0.02x$$

To solve for $x$, we can isolate it by dividing both sides by $0.02$:

$$x = \frac{40}{0.02} = 2000$$

Therefore, a person needs $2000$ calories to fulfill their daily caloric requirement.

We see that $x^2 + 4x + 4 = (x + 2)^2$. If $x$ must be positive, we can see that this expression can take on the value of any perfect square that is greater than or equal to $(1+2)^2=9$. The possible values between 10 and 50 are thus 16, 25, 36, and 49, achieved when $x=2,3,4,5$ respectively. So, there are $\boxed{4}$ positive integers $x$ for which $x^2+4x+4$ is between 10 and 50.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can factor the expression $x^2+4x+4$ as $(x+2)^2$. So, we want to find how many positive integers $x$ result in $(x+2)^2$ being between 10 and 50.

Starting with 10, we have $x+2=\sqrt{10}$, which gives us $x\approx1.162$. Since $x$ is a positive integer, this doesn't work.

Next, we have $x+2=\sqrt{11}$, which gives us $x\approx1.317$. Again, this doesn't work.

Continuing in this way, we find that $x+2$ is between $\sqrt{10}$ and $\sqrt{50}$, inclusive, starting at $x=1$ and going up to $x=6$. Therefore, there are $\boxed{6}$ positive integers $x$ that satisfy the inequality.

We first simplify $f(x)$:
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x^{(x+1)}(x+2)^{(x+3)}\\

If $x^2 + kx + 15= (x+a)(x+b)$, then \[x^2 + kx + 15 = x^2 + ax +bx +ab = x^2 +(a+b)x + ab.\]Therefore, we must have $ab = 15$, and for any such $a$ and $b$, we have $k = a+b$.   There are four pairs of integers that multiply to 15.  They are 1 and 15 (which give $k=16$), 3 and 5 (which give $k=8$), $-1$ and $-15$ (which gives $k=-16$), and -3 and -5 (which give $k=-8$).

Thus the possibilities for $(a,b)$ are $(1,15)$, $(3,5)$, $(-1,-15)$, $(-3,-5)$, $(15,1)$, $(5,3)$, $(-15,-1)$, and $(-5,-3)$. The corresponding values of $k$ for each pair are $16$, $8$, $-16$, $-8$, $16$, $8$, $-16$, and $-8$, respectively.

The three-digit number $abc$ is maximized when $a$ is maximized, and $a$ is maximized when $b$ is maximized, since 4, $a$, $b$ is a geometric sequence.  The largest digit is 9, so we'd like to find a digit $a$ such that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence.  The condition that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence is equivalent to $\frac{9}{a}=\frac{a}{4}$, which by clearing denominators is equivalent to $36=a^2$, which has solutions $a=\pm 6$.  One of these solutions is a digit, so $a=6$ and $b=9$ are the maximum values of $a$ and $b$.  If $b$, $c$, 5 is an arithmetic sequence, then the $c$ equals the average of $b$ and $5$, which is $(9+5)/2=7$.  So, $abc=\boxed{697}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $r$ be the common ratio between $4$, $a$, $b$. We know that $b = ar$ and $c = b+d$ for some common difference $d$. Then $c = ar + d$, and $5 = b + 2d = ar + 2d$. Simplifying the last equality gives $b = ar - 2d$. Substituting, we have $c = ar + b = 2ar - 2d$.

Since $a,b,c$ are digits, we have $1 \leq a < 5$ (since $4,a,b$ forms a geometric sequence) and $0 \leq d < 5$ (since adding the common difference cannot result in carrying). It follows that $5 \leq c < 10$.

We can also write $4 = \frac{b}{r^2}$, so $b = 4r^2$. Substituting, we have $ar = 4r^2$ and $c = 2ar - 2d = 8r^2 - 2d$.

Since $a,b,c$ are digits, $r$ must be a power of $2$ or a power of $\frac{1}{2}$. If $r = 2$, then $a = 8$, which is not a digit, so $r = \frac{1}{2}$ and $a = 2$. Then $b = 4$, $c = 10-2d$, and $c = 2ar - 2d = 8 - 2d$. Thus $d = 2$ and $c = 6$.

The greatest three-digit number $abc$ is $\boxed{206}$.

If the numerator has a factor of $x - 4$, then by the factor theorem, it must be 0 when $x = 4$.  Hence, $4^2 + 5 \cdot 4 + \alpha = 0$, which means $\alpha = -36$.

If the numerator has a factor of $x + 11$, then it must be 0 when $x = -11$.  Hence, $(-11)^2 + 5 \cdot (-11) + \alpha = 0$, which means $\alpha = -66$.

Extracting Answer from: 
If the function can be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions, then the denominator must have two distinct linear factors. We can factor the denominator as $(x-4)(x+11)$, so the function can be expressed in the form \[\frac{x^2+5x+\alpha}{x^2+7x-44} = \frac{a}{x-4} + \frac{b}{x+11}\]for some constants $a$ and $b$. 

Multiplying both sides by the denominator $(x-4)(x+11)$, we have \[x^2+5x+\alpha = a(x+11) + b(x-4).\]Setting $x=4$, we get $\alpha = 15a$, and setting $x=-11$, we get $\alpha = -7b$. Therefore, $15a = -7b$, so $b=-\frac{15}{7}a$. 

Thus, \[\frac{x^2+5x+\alpha}{x^2+7x-44} = \frac{a}{x-4} - \frac{15a/7}{x+11} = \frac{22}{39}\cdot\frac{a}{x-4} + \frac{17}{39}\cdot\frac{a}{x+11}.\]So the set $S$ consists of all the values of $\alpha$ for which this equation can be satisfied for some constant $a$. For a particular value of $\alpha$ to work, the coefficients in the expression above (i.e. $\frac{22a}{39}$ and $\frac{17a}{39}$) must both be nonzero. Therefore, $S$ is the set of all $\alpha$ such that $a\neq 0$. Since $a$ and $\alpha$ are related by $\alpha = 15a$, this means $\alpha$ can be any nonzero real number, and the sum of the elements of $S$ is the sum of all nonzero real numbers, which is $\boxed{\text{undefined}}$.

Since $h(1)=5$, we have $a\cdot 1 + b= 5$, so $a+b=5$. Since $h(-1) = 1$, we have $a\cdot (-1) + b = 1$, so $-a + b=1$. Adding these two equations gives $2b=6$, so $b=3$.  From $a+b=5$, we find $a=2$. Therefore, $h(x) = 2x+3$, so $h(6) = 2\cdot 6+3=\boxed{15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that $h(1)=5$ and $h(-1)=1$.  Plugging $x=1$ into $h(x)=ax+b$, we get $5=h(1)=a(1)+b=a+b$.  Plugging $x=-1$ into $h(x)=ax+b$, we get $1=h(-1)=a(-1)+b=-a+b$. 

Adding these equations gives $6=2b$, which means $b=3$.

Substituting $b=3$ into $5=a+b$ gives $a=2$. Thus $h(x) = 2x+3$ and $h(6) = 2(6)+3 = \boxed{15}$.

x^2 - 6x + y^2 + 2y &= 6\\
(x^2 - 6x + 9) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) &= 6 + 9 + 1\\
(x-3)^2 + (y+1)^2 &= 16

Let $z$ be the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$. We have
$$\frac{2}{z} = \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x+y}{xy} = \frac{14}{19}.$$Solving yields $z=\frac{38}{7}$. Now that we have the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means, we can use the well-known inequality:
$$\frac{2}{\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}} \le \sqrt{\frac{1}{x^2} + \frac{1}{y^2}},$$which yields that $\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \ge \frac{2xy}{x+y} = \frac{38\sqrt{19}}{49}$. Now we find an equality case, which by intuition or guess and check can be $x = \frac{\sqrt{65}+\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $y = \frac{\sqrt{65}-\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Thus,
$$x^2+y^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2}(x+y)\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}(x-y)\right)^2 = \boxed{\frac{589}{2}}.$$

We start by simplifying the expression $x^2+4x+4$ by factoring it as $(x+2)^2$. Setting this expression less than $20$ gives us $$(x+2)^2<20.$$ Taking the square root of both sides, we get $$x+2<2\sqrt{5}\approx 4.47,$$ which means $$x<2\sqrt{5}-2\approx 0.47.$$ Since $x$ is a positive integer, there are no positive integers $x$ that satisfy the inequality.

Let the energy of a photon equal $E$ and the wavelength equal $\lambda$.  Since the wavelength is inversely proportional to the energy, the product $E\lambda$ must be equal to some constant, say $k$.  Given photons of red light with a wavelength of $7\times10^{-7}$, we can write: \begin{align*}
E(7\times10^{-7})&=k\\
\Rightarrow\qquad 7\times10^{-7}&=\frac{k}{E}

To recuperate the cost of installing green technology, we need to figure out how long it takes for the energy savings to add up to $\$10,\!000.$

Let $x$ be the number of years it takes to break even. In $x$ years, the energy savings will be $x(\$1200) = \$1200x.$ The maintenance costs will be $650x$, and the total cost will be $\$10,\!000 + 650x.$

Setting these equal, we have:

\begin{align*}
1200x &= 10000 + 650x \\
550x &= 10000 \\
x &= \frac{10000}{550} \approx 18.18

After adding half the smallest term to each term, they become $\frac32a$, $\frac32a+7$, and $\frac32a+14$. Their sum is $\frac92a+21=120$, which gives $\frac92a=99$ or $a=\boxed{22}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the smallest term "x", and the common difference between terms "d". Then we can express the other two terms in the sequence as "x + d" and "x + 2d". We know that the largest and smallest terms differ by 14, so:

x + 2d - x = 14

This simplifies to:

2d = 14
d = 7

Now we can express the three terms after we add half of the smallest term to each:

(x/2) + x + 7 + (x/2) + 14 = 120

Simplifying this equation:

2x + 45 = 120
2x = 75
x = 37.5

Therefore, the original smallest term is 37.5.

The expansion of $(x+m)^2-63$ is $x^2+2mx+m^2-63$, which has a constant term of $m^2-63$. This constant term must be equal to the constant term of the original quadratic, so $m^2-63 = 1$, which yields the possibilities $m=8$ and $m=-8$.

If $m=8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2+16x+1$. If $m=-8$, then $(x+m)^2-63 = x^2-16x+1$. Of these two possibilities, only the first conforms to our information that $b$ was a positive number. So, the original quadratic was $x^2+16x+1$, giving $b=\boxed{16}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We begin by expanding $(x+m)^2 - 63$.

$$(x+m)^2-63 = x^2 + 2mx + m^2 - 63.$$

Comparing this with $x^2 + bx + 1$, we see that we must have $2m = b$, so this gives $m = \frac{b}{2}$. Substituting this into $(x+m)^2-63$, we get $x^2 + bx + 1 = \left(x+\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - 63$. This gives us $1 = \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - 63,$ so solving for $b$ gives $b=\boxed{16}$.

Let the constant term of Charles's quadratic be $c$, and the constant term of Eric's quadratic be $d$. Then Charles's discriminant is $(4)^2-4(1)(c)=16-4c$, and Eric's discriminant is $(4)^2-4(1)(d)=16-4d$. We're given that $$\frac{\text{Discriminant}_{\text{Eric}}}{\text{Discriminant}_{\text{Charles}}}=\frac{\text{Constant}_{\text{Charles}}}{\text{Constant}_{\text{Eric}}},$$or $\frac{16-4d}{16-4c}=\frac{c}{d}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the polynomial Eric thought of be $x^2+4x+ax+b$ and the polynomial Charles thought of be $x^2+4x+cx+d$. Then, we are given that \[\frac{(4)^2-4(a)(b)}{(4)^2-4(c)(d)}=\frac{d}{b}.\]

Simplify the left-hand fraction slightly, by dividing numerator and denominator by $4^2$. Note that $4^2-4(a)(b)=(2)^2[(2)^2-(ab)],$ and $4^2-4(c)(d)=(2)^2[(2)^2-(cd)]$, so that our equation becomes \[\frac{(2)^2-(ab)}{(2)^2-(cd)}=\frac{d}{b}.\] Suppose WLOG that $b$ is nonzero, so that dividing by $b$ is valid. Cross multiply to obtain \[(2)^2b^2-(ab)d=(2)^2d^2-(ab)d.\] Rearranging this equation gives \[(ab-d^2)=4d^2-4b^2=(2d+2b)(2d-2b).\] However $4(b+d)^2-4(b-d)^2=16bd+16b^2+16bd+16d^2-16b^2+16bd-16d^2+16b^2=32bd$ so that $(b+d)/(b-d)=8$. Also, multiplying the first equation by $b$ yields \[ab - bd = \left( b - \frac{d^2}{b} \right)  = \frac{4 d^2 - 4 b^2}{b} = 4\frac{b+d}{b}\cdot\frac{b-d}{b},\]so $\tfrac{d}{b}$ and $b+d$ have the same sign.

Now, observe that $b>d$; otherwise, since $b$ is not zero, we would have $d/b < 1$, hence \[\frac{d}{b} < \frac{(2)^2}{(2)^2} = 1.\] Thus, $b-d$ is negative, so $b+d$ must be as well; hence, we have $b+d=-8$ and $b-d=\frac{4b}{d}$. Substituting, we get $-16=4b\cdot\frac{1}{d}$, so $bd=-4$. And, since \[\frac{d}{b} = \frac{(2)^2-(ab)}{(2)^2-(cd)},\]we have \[\frac{d}{b}=\frac{4-ab}{4-cd}=\frac{4-ab}{4-c\left(\frac{-4}{c}\right)}=\frac{4-ab}8=\frac{2-ab}4.\]Substituting in our values for $bd$ and $\frac{d}{b}$ gives \[\frac{2-ab}4=\frac{d}{b}=\frac{-1}{4},\]so $ab=10$.

Again, we have \[(ab-d^2 )=4d^2-4b^2=(2d+2b)(2d-2b),\]so \[10-d^2=16(b+d)=16(-8)=-128,\]which again gives us $d^2=138$. And finally, the sum of their constant terms is simply $b+d=\boxed{-8}$.

Adding all three equations together yields $\log\frac{x}{y} + \log\frac{y}{z} + \log\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7$. From the identity $\log (x) + \log (y) = \log (xy)$, we obtain $\log\left(\frac{x}{y}\cdot\frac{y}{z}\cdot\frac{z}{x}\right) = a + 8$. Cancelations result in $\log(1) = a + 8$.

We use the logarithmic identity $\log a - \log b = \log \frac{a}{b}$ on each of the given equations:

\begin{align*}
\log \frac{x}{y} &= a, \\
\log \frac{y}{z} &= 15, \text{ and} \\
\log \frac{z}{x} &= -7. \\
\end{align*}

We can now write $\log \frac{x}{z}$ as $\log \frac{x}{z} = \log \frac{x}{y} + \log \frac{y}{z} = a + 15.$

Note that $\frac{x}{z}$ is positive. Therefore $\log \frac{x}{z}$ is defined, and we can use $\log \frac{x}{z} = -7$ to obtain:

\begin{align*}
