Extracting Answer from: 
To find the mean of these six test scores, we need to sum up all of the scores and divide by the total number of scores, which is 6.

The sum of the six test scores is:

70 + 80 + 90 + 75 + 80 + 85 = 480

So the mean is:

480 / 6 = 80

Therefore, the mean of these six test scores is 80.

Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the number of losses and wins for the original set of games 3x and 2x, respectively (since the ratio of losses to wins is 3 to 2). 

If the team had won twice as many games, they would have won 4x games (since 2x * 2 = 4x). So they would have lost (3/2) * 4x = 6x games (since the ratio of losses to wins is still 3 to 2). 

Therefore, the ratio of losses to wins for the new set of games would be 6x/4x = 3/2.

So the answer is $\boxed{\frac32}$.

Since the triangle on the left side of the diagram is a $30^\circ$-$60^\circ$-$90^\circ$, we can label its sides as shown:

[asy]
import olympiad;
draw((0,0)--(sqrt(3),0)--(0,sqrt(3))--cycle);
draw((0,0)--(-3,0)--(0,sqrt(3))--cycle);
label("8",(-3/2,sqrt(3)/2),NW);

draw("$30^{\circ}$",(-2.45,0),NE);
draw(rightanglemark((0,sqrt(3)),(0,0),(sqrt(3),0),5));
[/asy]

Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \begin{align*}
x^2 + (4\sqrt{3})^2 &= 8^2 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x^2 &= 8^2 - (4\sqrt{3})^2 \\
&= 64 - 48 = 16.

Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$.  Since there are four times as many right-handed boys, the number of right-handed boys is $4x$.  Since there are twice as many left-handed girls as left-handed boys, and there are $x$ left-handed boys, there are $2x$ left-handed girls.  We place all of this in a Venn diagram:

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/prealgebra/1176_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by assigning variables to the different groups of people:

Let x = the number of left-handed boys
Then 4x = the number of right-handed boys
And 2x = the number of left-handed girls
So, there are 3x = the number of right-handed girls

Now let's translate the problem into an equation:

x + 4x + 2x + 3x = 36

Simplifying this equation, we get:

10x = 36

So, x = 3.6

Since we can't have a fraction of a person, we know that x must be a whole number. Therefore, we need to round up to x = 4.

Now we can find the number of right-handed boys:

4x = 4(4) = 16

So there are 16 right-handed boys on the team.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's start by figuring out when each girl's total mileage surpasses that of each boy. We can set up an equation:

3 + 6x > 5x

where x is the number of days of practice. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3 > -x

x > -3

Since we can't have negative days of practice, we know that each girl's total mileage will surpass each boy's after 3 days of practice. 

Now, let's calculate the total mileage for each girl after 3 days of practice. 

On the first day, each girl runs 3 miles. 
On each of the next two days, each girl runs 6 miles. 

Total mileage for each girl after 3 days of practice:
3 + 6 + 6 = 15 miles

Therefore, each girl will have run 15 miles by the time the coach orders the new equipment.

This question is asking us to find the smallest common multiple of $18$ and $42.$ 

We can start by finding the prime factorizations of $18$ and $42:$

\begin{align*}
18 &= 2 \cdot 3^2 \\
42 &= 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7
\end{align*}

The prime factorization of the smallest common multiple must include all of the prime factors of both $18$ and $42$ raised to their highest powers:

\begin{align*}
\text{lcm}(18,42) &= 2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7 \\
&= 2 \cdot 9 \cdot 7 \\
&= \boxed{126}.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the smallest number of marbles that could be divided up either into bags of $18$ marbles or into bags of $42$ marbles, with no marbles left over in each case, is $126.$

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $\angle CAB=30^\circ$ and since the exterior angle at $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, \[\angle ABC=180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ.\]Angle $x$ and $\angle{BCA}$ are vertical angles and their measures are therefore equal. So, it suffices to find the measure of $\angle{BCA}$.

Since $\ell$ is parallel to $k$, we know that $\angle BAC = \angle CEF$.  Therefore, $\angle ACD = \angle CEF - 90^\circ$.  Also, $\angle ADC = \angle EFB = 90^\circ$.  Therefore, $$x = \angle CDB = \angle ACD + \angle ADC = (\angle CEF - 90^\circ) + 90^\circ = \boxed{30^\circ}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call the original price of the shirt $x$. We know that the sale price is $\$14.40$. 

We also know that the sale price is $60\%$ off the original price. To find the original price, we need to add back that $60\%$ discount to the sale price.

To add back a $60\%$ discount, we need to multiply the sale price by $(100\% - 60\%)$, which is the same as multiplying it by $40\%$ or $0.4$ as a decimal. 

So, $x = \frac{\$14.40}{0.4} = \$36$. 

Therefore, the original price of the shirt was $\$36.

Clearly the long light and dark gray strips along the four sides are identical, so they have the same area.  The only leftover dark gray pieces are the four $1\,\mathrm{in}\times 2\,\mathrm{in}$ pieces in the corners.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the width of each rectangle is 1 inch and the inner gray rectangle has an area of 100 $\text{in}^2$, the dimensions of the inner gray rectangle are $(7-2)(5-2)$, or $5\text{in}\cdot 3\text{in}$. This leaves us with the outer two gray rectangles surrounding the inner gray rectangle.

Each of these rectangles has a width and height increased by 2 inches from the inner rectangle. Thus, the width of each gray strip is $7+2=9$ inches and the height is $5+2=7$ inches. The area of each strip can be found by multiplying the width and height, so the area of one strip is $9\text{in}\cdot 7\text{in} = 63\text{in}^2$. Since there are two gray strips in total, the area of both strips combined is $2\cdot 63\text{in}^2 = 126\text{in}^2$. 

Therefore, the area of the outer dark gray strip is $126\text{in}^2 - 100\text{in}^2 = \boxed{26\text{in}^2}$.

We can begin by simplifying the given decimals. Let $x = 0.\overline{3}$. Multiplying both sides of $x$ by $10$, we get $$10x = 3.\overline{3}.$$ Subtracting the equation $x=0.\overline{3}$ from $10x=3.\overline{3}$ yields $$9x = 3,$$ so $x=\frac{1}{3}$. 

Similarly, let $y = 0.8\overline{3}$. Multiplying both sides of $y$ by $10$, we get $$10y = 8.\overline{3}.$$ Subtracting the equation $y=0.8\overline{3}$ from $10y=8.\overline{3}$ yields $$9y = 8,$$ so $y=\frac{8}{9}$. 

Therefore, $$\frac{0.\overline{3}}{0.8\overline{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{8}{9}}.$$ Inverting and multiplying the denominator by $3$ gives $$\frac{0.\overline{3}}{0.8\overline{3}} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{9}{8} = \boxed{\frac{3}{8}}.$$

Also, each player plays one game against each of the other three players in his or her own school. Each school has four players, so each school will have a total of $4 \times 3/2 = 6$ of these games. Since there are three schools, there are $3 \times 6 = 18$ games played within each school.

The number 1 to any power is always 1, so no matter how many times Hypatia and Euclid cube their numbers, they will both always have the number 1. Thus, Hypatia and Euclid both write down the number 1.


Now, lets take a look at Pythagoras. He keeps cubing his result 20 times starting with the number 2. The numbers he has are \begin{align*}
2^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}8 \\
8^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}512 \\
512^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}134217728 \\
\vdots
\end{align*}We can see that these numbers get out of hand pretty quickly (no wonder it took them so long), so instead, we look at the sum of the results because that is what we are trying to find. Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$. Because the number Ptolemy chose is the negation of what Pythagoras chose, after a certain number of cubes, whatever Pythagoras has, Ptolemy will have the opposite of that. Thus, whatever gigantic number Pythagoras has at the end of the game, Ptolemy will have the negation of that number, and they will add to zero.

Thus, our desired sum is  \begin{align*}1+1&+(\text{some huge number}) + (-\text{the same huge number})\\
&=1+1+0=\boxed{2}.

Extracting Answer from: 
Hypatia's number is 1 cubed 20 times which is simply 1. The same goes for Euclid's number.

Ptolemy's number is -2 cubed 20 times. Since -2 multiplied by itself an even amount of times is always positive, we can first find 2 cubed 20 times, and then negate it. 

2 cubed is 8, which cubed again is 512, and then cubed again is 134,217,728. Since Ptolemy chose -2, the final number is -134,217,728.

Pythagoras's number is 2 cubed 20 times, which is simply 2 to the power of 60. We can simplify this by using the fact that $2^6=64$ and $2^{10}=1024$ are both powers of two that are close to powers of ten. 

$2^{60} = 2^{6\cdot10} = (2^6)^{10} = 64^{10} \approx 10^{16}$. So Pythagoras's number is approximately $10^{16}$.

Adding up all the numbers we get:

$$1+1+(-134,\!217,\!728)+10^{16}$$

which is approximately $10^{16} - 134,\!217,\!726$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the average of the $6$ tests Heidi has already taken. Then, her total points prior to the final exam is $6x$. 

Since the final exam counts as two tests, it is worth twice as much as each of the other six tests. Therefore, the total weight of all the tests is equivalent to $6+2=8$ tests. 

We know that Heidi needs a $90$-point average for the semester, and she has already scored a total of $6x$ points. Thus, the total number of points she needs (including the final exam) is $8\times 90 = 720$, or $$6x+2\cdot 99 = 720.$$ Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get $$x=\frac{720-2\cdot 99}{6} = 107.$$ Therefore, Heidi has scored an average of $\boxed{107}$ points on each of her six tests prior to the final exam.

The area of each of the $12^{\prime \prime}$ diameter pizza's slices is $\frac{1}{8}$ the area of the full circle, which is $\frac{\pi (6^{\prime\prime})^2}{8} = 9\pi$ square inches. Since Jane ate three slices, she consumed a total of $3\cdot 9\pi = 27\pi$ square inches of pizza. 

Similarly, the area of each of the $16^{\prime\prime}$ diameter pizza's slices is $\frac{1}{8}$ the area of the full circle, which is $\frac{\pi (8^{\prime\prime})^2}{8} = 16\pi$ square inches. Since Mark ate three slices, he consumed $3\cdot 16\pi = 48\pi$ square inches of pizza. 

Therefore, Mark ate $48\pi - 27\pi = \boxed{21\pi}$ square inches more pizza than Jane.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we can simplify the inequality by dividing both sides by 1.2: $t \leq 8$. This tells us that the largest possible integer value for $t$ is 8. To find the sum of all positive integer values of $t$ that satisfy this inequality, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: $S = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms in the series, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.

In this case, the first term is 1 and the last term is 8, so we have:

$S = \frac{8-1+1}{2}(1+8) = \frac{8 \cdot 9}{2} = \boxed{36}$

Therefore, the sum of all positive integers $t$ that satisfy the inequality $1.2t \leq 9.6$ is 36.

We can begin by multiplying all parts of the inequality by 5 to get rid of the fraction: $$\frac{2}{3} \cdot 5 < x < \frac{6}{7} \cdot 5.$$ Simplifying: $$\frac{10}{3} < x < \frac{30}{7}.$$ To get an integer solution, we want to choose the smallest integer $x$ that satisfies this inequality. So, we need to round up on the left inequality and round down on the right inequality. Thus, $$x = 4.$$ We can check that this solution works: $$\frac{2}{3} < \frac{4}{5} < \frac{6}{7}.$$

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use a proportion to solve the problem. Let's set up the proportion using the distance and time values we know:

1.7 miles / 0.5 hours = 17 miles / x hours

where x is the number of hours it would take Aditi to walk 17 miles.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

1.7 miles * x hours = 0.5 hours * 17 miles

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = (0.5 hours * 17 miles) / 1.7 miles
x = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take Aditi 5 hours to walk 17 miles at the same constant speed.

Checking, we see that the value $n = 4$ indeed works: the original equation becomes $11x + 1 = 11x + 1$, which is always true, so any value of $x$ is a solution. Note that we can also obtain more than one solution if we simplify \[4x + 6 + 7x - 9 = 12x - 7 - x + n\]to get \[11x - 3 = 11(x - 1) + n,\]which holds for any value of $n$ if we choose $x = 1.$

Let's first convert Drinkets to Blinkets:
- 3 Blinkets = 7 Drinkets
- 1 Blinket = 7/3 Drinkets (divide both sides by 3)

So, to convert 56 Drinkets to Blinkets:
- 1 Blinket = 7/3 Drinkets
- 56 Drinkets = (7/3) x 56 Blinkets = 392/3 Blinkets

Now we can convert Blinkets to Trinkets:
- 4 Blinkets = 1 Trinket
- 1 Blinket = 1/4 Trinket (divide both sides by 4)

So, to convert 392/3 Blinkets to Trinkets:
- 1 Blinket = 1/4 Trinket
- 392/3 Blinkets = (1/4) x 392/3 Trinkets = 98/3 Trinkets

From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\frac{10}{2} =\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon.

Extracting Answer from: 
A convex pentagon has 5 vertices. To draw a diagonal, we need to choose 2 vertices such that they are not adjacent (we don't want to draw sides of the pentagon). 

Choosing any 2 non-adjacent vertices will give us a diagonal, so we start with $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ possible choices. However, we need to subtract the 5 sides of the pentagon itself, which are not diagonals. 

Therefore, the number of distinct diagonals of a convex pentagon that can be drawn is:

$\binom{5}{2} - 5 = 10 - 5 = \boxed{5}$

\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive.

We begin by solving the inequality $4n + 3 < 25$. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we obtain $4n < 22$, and dividing by 4 we have $n < 5.5$. Similarly, we solve $-7n + 5 < 24$ by subtracting 5 from both sides and then dividing by $-7$. This gives $n > -3$. Therefore, we want to find the integers $n$ that satisfy $n>-3$ and $n<5.5$. The integers that satisfy these inequalities are $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, so there are $\boxed{8}$ integers that satisfy both inequalities.

The next pair cancels out in the same way: $x^3 + x^4 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^4 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  Now, it is easy to see that the pattern continues for every pair of powers, all the way up to $x^{2009} + x^{2010}$.  Notice that $x^{2011}$ is the only power that hasn't been canceled out.

We need to remember the order of operations: first we do any calculations inside parentheses, then exponents, then multiplication and division (working from left to right), and finally addition and subtraction (working from left to right).

To simplify the given expression, we must first evaluate $3\cdot 7$ and $64\div 2$ using multiplication and division from left to right:

\begin{align*}
182+3\cdot 7-64\div 2+27\div 3&=182+21-32+9\\

First, we simplify the left side.  We have  \[3p-2(p-4) = 3p - 2p + 8 = p + 8,\] so we can write the original equation as $p+8 = 7p + 6$.  Subtracting $p$ from both sides gives $8=6p+6$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2 = 6p$.  Finally, dividing by 6 gives $p = 2/6 = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we can simplify the left side of the equation by distributing the negative sign: 

$3p - 2p + 8 = 7p + 6$

Combining like terms on both sides gives: 

$p + 8 = 7p + 6$

Next, we can isolate the variable $p$ on one side of the equation by subtracting $p$ from both sides: 

$8 = 6p + 6$

Subtracting 6 from both sides gives: 

$2 = 6p$

Finally, we can solve for $p$ by dividing both sides by 6: 

$p = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is $p = \frac{1}{3}$.

Convert both decimals into fractions. \begin{align*}

\Rightarrow x &= \frac{2}{9}.
\end{align*}Likewise, $.\overline{6}=\frac{6}{9}$. Adding the two fractions yields $\frac{2}{9} + \frac{6}{9}=\frac{8}{9}$. The reciprocal of this is $\frac{1}{\frac{8}{9}}=\frac{9}{8}$. To convert this to a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 125. Doing so, we get \[\frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{125}{125} = \frac{9 \cdot 125}{8 \cdot 125} = \frac{1125}{1000}=\boxed{1.125}.\]

If we can express this number as a single power of 10, then we can directly find the number of zeroes at the end of the numbers. Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it. We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\left( a^m \right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$. Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \begin{align*}
(10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div \left(10^{15}\right)^4 &= (10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $97$ is the largest prime less than $100$, all the numbers from $2$ through $96$ are composite.  We list the primes between $2$ and $96$: $$\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c} 2&3&5&7&11&13&17&19&23 \\ 29&31&37&41&43&47&53&59&61 \\ 67&71&73&79&83&89&97 \\ \end{array}$$ Note that $97$ is also on the list.  Any factor of $97!$ must be a product of numbers from the list, some of which may be repeated.  To find the largest possible prime factor of $97!$, then, we begin by trying to include as many copies of each prime on the list as possible.  For example, the prime factor $89$ appears in the list, but it is possible to use only one factor of $89$, since $89$ appears only once on the list, whereas we can include $2$ factors of $83$, since both $83$ and $166$ appear on the list.  So far we have:\begin{align*} 97! &= 2^{48} \: \cdot \: 3^{30} \: \cdot \: 5^{19} \: \cdot \: 7^{13} \: \cdot \: 11^8 \: \cdot \: 13^7 \: \cdot \: 17^5 \: \cdot \: 19^5 \: \cdot \: 23^4 \\ &\qquad\qquad  \cdot\: 29^3 \: \cdot \: 31^3 \: \cdot \: 37^2 \: \cdot \: 41^2 \: \cdot\: 43^2 \: \cdot \: 47^2 \: \cdot \: 53 \: \cdot \: 59 \: \cdot \: 61 \: \cdot \: 67 \\ &\qquad\qquad  \cdot\: 71 \: \cdot \: 73 \: \cdot \: 79 \: \cdot \: 83^2 \: \cdot \: 89 \: \cdot \: 97. \end{align*} We need to find the largest prime factor of the number above, which is $\boxed{97}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
In a 30-60-90 right triangle, the shorter leg is half the length of the hypotenuse and the longer leg is $\sqrt{3}$ times the shorter leg. Let $x$ be the length of the shorter leg. Then, the longer leg has length $\sqrt{3}x$ and the hypotenuse has length $2\sqrt{6}$. Since this is a right triangle, we have $x^2+(\sqrt{3}x)^2=(2\sqrt{6})^2$. Simplifying gives $4x^2=24$, so $x^2=6$. Therefore, $x=\sqrt{6}$.

The sum of the lengths of the two legs is $x+\sqrt{3}x=x(1+\sqrt{3})=\sqrt{6}(1+\sqrt{3})$. This is approximately equal to $\boxed{4.1}$ centimeters.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/prealgebra/2086_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
First, we need to find the conversion rates for daps and baps in terms of yaps. 

From the given information, we know that 4 daps = 7 yaps and 5 yaps = 3 baps. 

To find the conversion rate between daps and baps, we can substitute the first equation into the second: 

5 yaps = 3 baps 

5/7 * 4 daps = 3 baps 

20 daps = 21 baps 

Now, we know that 20 daps equal 21 baps. To find how many daps equal 42 baps, we can set up a proportion: 

20 daps / 21 baps = x daps / 42 baps 

Cross-multiplying: 

20 daps * 42 baps = 21 baps * x daps 

840 daps = 21 baps * x daps 

Simplifying: 

x daps = 840 daps / 21 baps 

x daps = 40 daps 

Therefore, 40 daps equal 42 baps.

We want to find $1 \cdot (3x-4) + 2 \cdot (3x-9) + 3 \cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$.

Let's start by finding the cost of one rambutan. We know that rambutan costs $2x$ more than dragonfruit, which costs $x-4$. So the cost of rambutan is:

$$
x-4+2x = 3x-4
$$

Next, we need to find the cost of two starfruit. We know that starfruit is five dollars less expensive than rambutan, which we just found to be $3x-4. So the cost of one starfruit is:

$$
3x-4-5=3x-9
$$

And the cost of two starfruit is:

$$
2(3x-9)=6x-18
$$

Finally, we need to find the cost of three dragonfruit, which cost $x-4$ each. So the cost of three dragonfruit is:

$$
3(x-4)=3x-12
$$

To find the total cost, we add up the cost of one rambutan, two starfruit, and three dragonfruit:

$$
3x-4 + 6x-18 + 3x-12 = \boxed{12x-34}
$$

So the expression that represents the total cost is $12x-34.

GPT File: datasets/persona_confidence_copy/persona_confidence_copy/prealgebra/247_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
We can use a series of conversions to figure out how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops. 

First, we know that 3 ballops = 11 fallops. Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to find that 30 ballops = 110 fallops. 

Next, we know that 6 wallops = 5 ballops. Therefore, we can use this conversion to find that 36 wallops = 30 ballops. 

Putting these two conversions together, we can find how many wallops are equivalent to 110 fallops: 

36 wallops = 30 ballops
30 ballops = 110 fallops

Therefore:
36 wallops = 30 ballops = 110 fallops/3

Multiplying both sides by 10, we get:
360 wallops = 1100 fallops 

Therefore, 110 fallops are equivalent to 360 wallops.

Thank you for the vote of confidence! Let's break down the problem in order of operations:

1. First, we have to calculate what's inside the parentheses: $3 \times 5$ is simply 15.
2. We then divide 45 by 15, which gives us 3.
3. We now substitute 15 and 3 in the expression: $92 - 3 - 5^2$.
4. Next, we calculate $5^2$, which is 25.
5. Finally, we perform the subtraction: $92 - 3 - 25$, which gives us 64.

Therefore, $92 - 45 \div (3 \times 5) - 5^2$ simplifies to 64.

Extracting Answer from: 
To stack the books in a different order, we have to consider the first position for the first book, the second position for the second book, and so on. 

For the first position we could put any of the 5 books. For the second position, there would be 4 books left to choose from since we can't repeat the one that we put in the first position. For the third position, there would be 3 books left to choose from, and so on until we get to the last position where there would be only 1 book left to choose from.

So the total number of ways to stack 5 different books on a shelf is:

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

Therefore, there are 120 ways to stack 5 different books on a shelf.

Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call my age now "x". According to the problem, my brother is 4 times as old as me, so his age is "4x". 

Six years from now, my age will be "x + 6", and my brother's age will be "4x + 6". According to the problem, my brother will be twice as old as me then: 

4x + 6 = 2(x + 6) 

We can simplify and solve for x: 

4x + 6 = 2x + 12 

2x = 6 

x = 3 

So my age now is 3, which means my brother's age is 4 times as old: 

4x = 4(3) = 12 

Therefore, my brother is currently 12 years old.

At 3:20, the hour hand is at 3, which is 1/4 of the way between 3 and 4. Each hour mark represents 30 degrees on a clock, so the hour hand is at 1/4 * 30 degrees = 7.5 degrees past 3.

The minute hand is at 4, which represents 120 degrees on a clock. At 20 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 1/3 of the way between 4 and 5. Each minute mark represents 6 degrees on a clock, so the minute hand is at 1/3 * 6 degrees = 2 degrees past 4.

To find the acute angle between the hands, we subtract the smaller angle from the larger angle. The larger angle is between the minute hand and the 12, which is 120 degrees. The smaller angle is between the hour hand and the 4, which is 7.5 degrees.

The acute angle between the hands is therefore 120 degrees - 7.5 degrees - 2 degrees = 110.5 degrees.

Extracting Answer from: 
If 450 juniors drink 1500 cartons of milk in 5 days, then each junior drinks (on average) 1500/450 = 3.33 cartons of milk per week. 

Therefore, the total number of cartons of milk that the 600 seniors would drink per week is 3.33 cartons/junior x 600 juniors = 1998 cartons of milk per week. 

To find the average number of cartons of milk that the seniors drink each school day, we need to divide this total by the number of school days in a week. 

Assuming a standard 5-day school week, the seniors would drink an average of 1998 cartons/5 days = 399.6 cartons of milk per day. Rounded to the nearest whole number, the average number of cartons of milk the 600 seniors drink each school day is 400.

There are $12$ inches in a foot, so the length of the rectangular section of floor is $36$ inches and its width is $24$ inches. It would take $36 \div 6 = 6$ tiles to cover the length of the floor and $24 \div 6 = 4$ tiles to cover the width, so a total of $6 \times 4 = \boxed{24}$ tiles are needed to cover the whole rectangular section of the floor.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will first convert the dimensions of the rectangular section of floor from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so the rectangular section of floor is 3 feet x 12 inches per foot = 36 inches wide and 2 feet x 12 inches per foot = 24 inches long. 

Next, we need to determine how many tiles are needed to cover the rectangular section of floor. Each tile has an area of 6 inches x 6 inches = 36 square inches. To calculate the number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the rectangular section of floor by the area of one tile.

The total area of the rectangular section of floor is 36 inches x 24 inches = 864 square inches. 

To cover this area, we need 864 square inches ÷ 36 square inches per tile = 24 square tiles.

Therefore, we need 24 six-inch by six-inch square tiles to cover a three-foot by two-foot rectangular section of floor.

We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{2}{5} - \frac{5}{12}.\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.

To get this common denominator for the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\frac{48}{120}$.

To get the common denominator for $\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{48}{120} - \frac{50}{120} = \frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \frac{22}{120}.\]Notice that $\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\frac{2\cdot11}{2\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$.

We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\!321/3=\boxed{18,\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321, we can start by dividing 54,321 by the largest possible factor, which is itself. 

54,321 ÷ 54,321 = 1 

Since 1 is a factor of all numbers, including 54,321, we need to move on to the next largest possible factor, which is half of 54,321. 

54,321 ÷ 2 = 27,160.5 

However, 27,160.5 is not a whole number, so we need to find the next largest integer factor. 

54,321 ÷ 3 = 18,107 

18,107 is a whole number and a factor of 54,321, so it is the largest factor of 54,321 that is less than 54,321. 

Therefore, the answer is 18,107.

It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\overline{3}$: \[
10 \cdot .0\overline{3} = .\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow .0\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \div 10 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30}.
\]Next, $.\overline{03}$: \[
99 \cdot .\overline{03} = (100-1) \cdot .\overline{03} = 3.\overline{03} - .\overline{03} = 3\\
\Rightarrow .\overline{03} = \frac{3}{99} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 33} = \frac{1}{33}.
\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3} \div .\overline{03} &= \frac{1}{30} \div \frac{1}{33}= \frac{1}{30} \cdot \frac{33}{1}\\
&= \frac{33}{30} = \frac{3 \cdot 11}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{11}{10}\\

To find the class average, we need to find the total number of points earned on the test, then divide by the total number of students.

- 20 students scored 80, so they earned a total of 20 x 80 = 1600 points.
- 8 students scored 90, so they earned a total of 8 x 90 = 720 points.
- 2 students scored 100, so they earned a total of 2 x 100 = 200 points.

Thus, the total number of points earned by the class is 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520.

Since there are 30 students in the class, the class average is 2520 / 30 = 84.

Therefore, the class average on this test was 84.

Since the two angles together form a line, we have $(x + 26^\circ)+ (2x+10^\circ) = 180^\circ$.  Simplifying gives $3x + 36^\circ = 180^\circ$, so $3x = 144^\circ$ and $x = \boxed{48^\circ}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The diagram shows a straight line and two angles that are adjacent to each other. Since the sum of the two angles is equal to $180^\circ$, we have

$$(x+26^\circ)+(2x+10^\circ)=180^\circ$$

Simplifying the equation gives:

$$3x+36^\circ=180^\circ$$

Subtracting $36^\circ$ from both sides, we get:

$$3x=144^\circ$$

Therefore, $x=48^\circ$.

Remember that $\frac{25}{4}$ divided by $\frac{1}{12}$ is the same as $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$. We can rewrite $\frac{25}{4} \cdot \frac{12}{1}$ as $25 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot 12$, which can then be expressed as $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$. Twelve divided by four is three, so $25 \cdot \frac{12}{4}$ is the same thing as $25 \cdot 3$, which equals $\boxed{75}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
To find the actual distance between the cities, we need to use the scale given in the question. 

According to the scale, 0.5 centimeters on the map represent 1 kilometer in real life. 

Therefore, we can set up a proportion: 

0.5 cm on the map = 1 km in real life 

4 cm on the map = x km in real life 

Cross multiplying, we get: 

0.5 * x = 4 

x = 8 

So the cities are actually 8 kilometers apart.
