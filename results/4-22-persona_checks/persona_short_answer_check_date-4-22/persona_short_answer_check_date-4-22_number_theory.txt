Answer: Convert the given prices to base ten. 

$242_5 = 2(5^2)^1 + 4(5^1)^1 + 2(5^0)^1 = 2 \cdot 25 + 4 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 1 = 56$
$367_8 = 3(8^2)^1 + 6(8^1)^1 + 7(8^0)^1 = 3 \cdot 64 + 6 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 1 = 231$

Then, multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours worked, add the cost of equipment, and convert the result to base ten: 

$(56 \cdot 3.5) + 231 = 196 + 231 = 427_{10}$

Therefore, Kirsty will owe the plumber $\boxed{\$427}$ in base ten dollars.

Jan steps on step number $s$ if $13\leq s \leq 130$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.  Jen steps on step number $s$ if $3\leq s \leq 139$ and $s$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$.  Therefore, we are counting the number of integers between $13$ and $130$ which leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$ and a remainder of $3$ when divided by $4$. Let's check the remainders of Jan's first few steps when divided by 4. \[
13 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
16 \rightarrow 0
\] \[
19 \rightarrow 3
\] \[
22 \rightarrow 2
\] \[
25 \rightarrow 1
\] \[
\vdots
\] We see that the remainders of Jan's steps when divided by 4 cycle through the list $1,0,3,2$. Therefore, only every fourth step that Jan steps on will also be stepped on by Jen, so we are counting the number of elements in $\{19,31,43,\ldots,127\}$.  Writing this list in the form  \[\{19+0\cdot12,19+1\cdot12,19+2\cdot12,\ldots,19+9\cdot12\},\] we see that $\boxed{10}$ steps are stepped on by both Jen and Jan.

Note: This problem is essentially an application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Since the ratio of $A$ to $B$ is $3:7$, there is an integer $k$ for which $A=3k$ and $B=7k$. Moveover, $k$ is the greatest common divisor of $A$ and $B$, since 3 and 7 are relatively prime. Recalling the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[A,B]\cdot\gcd(A,B)=AB$, we find that $1575k=(3k)(7k),$ which implies $k=1575/21=\boxed{75}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let's call $A=x$ and $B=y$. We know that $\text{lcm}(x,y)=1575$, and that $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{3}{7}$.

We can use the fact that $\text{lcm}(x,y)\cdot \gcd(x,y)=xy$ for any positive integers $x$ and $y$. Substituting our given values, we get:

$$1575 \cdot \gcd(x,y) = xy$$

Next, we can substitute $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{3}{7}$ into this equation and simplify:

\begin{align*}
1575 \cdot \gcd(x,y) &= x \cdot y \\
1575 \cdot \gcd(3y,7y) &= 3y \cdot 7y \\
1575 \cdot \gcd(3,7) \cdot y &= 21y^2 \\
225 \cdot y &= 21y^2 \\
y &= 75
\end{align*}

Finally, we can substitute $y=75$ into $\frac{x}{y}=\frac{3}{7}$ to find that $x=225$, and the $\gcd(x,y) = \gcd(225,75) = \boxed{75}$.

The greatest common divisor of $2^a3^b5^c\cdots$ and $2^{a'}3^{b'}5^{c'}\cdots$ is $$2^{\min\{a,a'\}}3^{\min\{b,b'\}}5^{\min\{c,c'\}}\cdots.$$That is, each prime occurs with the smaller of the two exponents with which it occurs in the prime factorizations of the original two numbers.

In this case, the prime $11$ occurs with exponent $11$ in both of the original numbers, while all other primes occur with an exponent smaller than $11$ in one of the original numbers. Specifically, \begin{align*}

The units digit of each term in the sum is determined only by the units digits of the two numbers being multiplied. In each product $AB,$ the units digit only depends on the units digit of $A$ and $B.$ Therefore, we can simply compute the units digits of all the terms individually and add them together.

$(972 - 268)(973 - 267)(974 - 266)$ has units digit $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 = 192,$ so its units digit is 2.
$(968 - 272)(967 - 273)(966 - 274)$ has units digit $6 \cdot 1 \cdot 6 = 36,$ so its units digit is 6.
$(999 - 222)^3$ has units digit $7^3 = 343,$ so its units digit is 3.
Therefore the units digit of the entire expression is $2 + 6 - 3 = \boxed{5}.$

The prime factorization of $210 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the residues of $N$ modulo $5$, $6$, and $7$. Since the units digit of $N$ in base $6$ is equal to $0$, it follows that $N$ is divisible by $6$. Also, we note that $N$ is congruent modulo $b-1$ to the sum of its base $b$ digits. Indeed, if $N$ can be represented as $(\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\cdots a_0})_b$, then \begin{align*}N &\equiv a_k \cdot b^k + a_{k-1} \cdot b^{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 \cdot b + a_0 \\ &\equiv a_k \cdot ((b-1) + 1)^k + \cdots + a_1 \cdot ((b-1) + 1) + a_0 \\
& \equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + \cdots + a_1 + a_0 \pmod{b-1}.
\end{align*}It follows that $N \equiv 5+3+1+3+4+0 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$ and that $N \equiv 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.$ By the Chinese Remainder Theorem and inspection, we determine that $N \equiv 31 \pmod{35}$, so that (by the Chinese Remainder Theorem again) $N \equiv \boxed{66} \pmod{210}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem, combined with some basic properties of numbers written in different bases.

Since $N$ can be written in base $6$ as $531340_6$, we know that in base $10$, $$N = 5 \cdot 6^5 + 3 \cdot 6^4 + 1 \cdot 6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 4 \cdot 6^1 + 0 \cdot 6^0.$$ To see why this is true, note that the rightmost digit of the base $6$ expression represents the units digit of the number, the next digit to the left represents the digit in the $6^1$ place, and so on.

Similarly, since $N$ can be written in base $8$ as $124154_8$, we know that in base $10$, $$N = 1 \cdot 8^5 + 2 \cdot 8^4 + 4 \cdot 8^3 + 1 \cdot 8^2 + 5 \cdot 8^1 + 4 \cdot 8^0.$$ 

Thus, we know that $N$ leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by $6$, since the units digit of the base $6$ expression is $0$. We also know that $N$ leaves a remainder of $2$ when divided by $8$, since the units digit of the base $8$ expression is $4$.

To find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $35$, we now have to solve the system of congruences $$\begin{aligned} N &\equiv 0 \pmod 6, \\ N &\equiv 2 \pmod 8. \end{aligned}$$The first congruence tells us that $N$ must be divisible by $6$, so we can write $N = 6k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $$6k \equiv 2 \pmod 8,$$which simplifies to $$3k \equiv 1 \pmod 4.$$The solution to this congruence is $k \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, so we can write $k = 4j + 3$ for some integer $j$. Substituting this back into $N = 6k$, we get $$N = 6k = 6(4j + 3) = 24j + 18.$$Thus, $N$ leaves a remainder of $18$ when divided by $35$.

Finally, we note that $210 = 6 \cdot 35$, so by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, any number that leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by $6$ and a remainder of $18$ when divided by $35$ will leave the same remainder when divided by $210$. Therefore, the remainder when $N$ is divided by $210$ is $\boxed{18}$.

A three-digit palindrome must be of the form $1\Box1, 2\Box2, \cdots 9\Box9$, where $\Box$ is any digit from 0 to 9. So there are $9\cdot10=90$ three-digit palindromes. Now we look at which ones are multiples of 3. Recall that a positive integer is a multiple of 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. If we look at $1\Box1$, we want $1+1+\Box$ to be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 1, 4, or 7. With $2\Box2$, $2+2+\Box$ should be a multiple of 3, so $\Box$ could be 2, 5, or 8. With $3\Box3$, $\Box$ could be 0, 3, 6, or 9. The possible $\Box$ values then repeat, $4\Box4$ giving 1, 4, or 7, $5\Box5$ giving 2, 5, or 8, etc. So the number of multiples of 3 is $3\times (3+3+4)=30$. Since there are 90 three-digit palindromes in all, we get a probability of $\frac{30}{90}=\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}$.

The prime factorization of 99 is $3^2\cdot11$. So for $\frac{n}{99}$ to be in lowest terms, $n$ cannot be divisible by 3 or 11. The possible values of $n$ are from 1 to 98, inclusive, so there are 98 possible values for $n$. We can find the number of multiples of 3 and multiples of 11 and subtract from 98 to get the number of values that aren't divisible by 3 or 11. For multiples of 3, we go from 3 to 96, or $3\cdot1$ to $3\cdot32$, so there are 32 multiples of 3 from 1 to 98, inclusive. For multiples of 11, we go from 11 to 88, so there are 8 multiples of 11 from 1 to 98, inclusive. We have to make sure we don't double-count the numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 11: 33 and 66. So there are $32+8-2=38$ values of $n$ that are divisible by 3 or 11. That means there are $98-38=\boxed{60}$ values of $n$ for which $\frac{n}{99}$ is in lowest terms.

Extracting Answer from: 
We first compute the prime factorization of 2010, which is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 67$. Therefore, if we want $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ to be a repeating decimal, then $n^2$ cannot be divisible by 3 and 67 at the same time. If this were the case, then we could convert our fraction to $\frac{k}{10}$, where $201k = n^2$, and $\frac{k}{10}$ is clearly a terminating decimal. Conversely, no simplified terminating decimal has a factor of 3 or 67 in the denominator. It follows that if $n$ is not divisible by $3\cdot 67$, then $n$ is a repeating decimal. Therefore, we need to compute the number of values of $n$ that yield squares which are not divisible by 3 and 67. However, $n^2$ is divisible by 3 and 67 if and only if $n$ must be divisible by 3 and 67. Therefore, $n$ cannot be divisible by $3 \cdot 67=201$. There are $10$ multiplies of $201$ which are less than or equal to $2010$, so there are $2010 - 10 = \boxed{2000}$ values of $n$ that yield a fraction $\frac{n^2}{2010}$ which is a repeating decimal.

Let $n^2/2010$ have a repeating decimal representation with period $k$. Then $n^2/2010 = \overline{a_1a_2\dots a_k}.\overline{a_1a_2\dots a_k} \ldots$ where the overline denotes the repeating decimal, and $0 \leq a_i \leq 9$.

Multiplying both sides by $10^k$, we get
\begin{align*} \frac{10^k n^2}{2010} &= a_1a_2\dots a_k.\overline{a_1a_2\dots a_k} \ldots \\  \frac{10^k n^2}{2010} &= \overline{a_1a_2\dots a_k} + \frac{a_1a_2\dots a_k}{10^k-1}.  \end{align*}
Hence $\frac{10^k n^2}{2010} - \frac{a_1a_2\dots a_k}{10^k-1}$ is an integer. But
$$\left| \frac{a_1a_2\dots a_k}{10^k-1} \right| \leq \frac{9}{10^k-1} < 10^{\log_{10} (k+1)}.$$
Hence $10^k n^2/2010$ must be within a distance of $10^{\log_{10} (k+1)}$ from an integer, or $$\left|\frac{10^k n^2}{2010} - m\right| < 10^{\log_{10} (k+1)}$$ for some integer $m$. This implies that
$$\frac{n^2}{2010} - \frac{m}{10^k} = \frac{10^k n^2}{2010} - m - \frac{a_1a_2\dots a_k}{10^k}$$
is small. Specifically,
$$\left| \frac{n^2}{2010} - \frac{m}{10^k} \right| \leq \frac{1}{10^k (2010-1)} + \frac{9}{10^k (10^k-1)} \leq \frac{10}{2010 \cdot 10^k}.$$Hence we need $\frac{10}{2010 \cdot 10^k} < \frac{1}{10^6}$ or $k < 4$.

There are $\boxed{111}$ possible values of $n$.

The base-$b$ representation of $2013$ ends in $3$ if and only if $2013$ leaves a remainder of $3$ when divided by $b$: that is, if $2010$ is a multiple of $b.$ Since $2010 = 2^1 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^1 \cdot 67^1,$ it has $(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 16$ positive divisors. However, since $3$ is a valid digit in base $b,$ we must have $b > 3,$ so we must subtract $3$ from our count (since $1,$ $2,$ and $3$ are all divisors of $2010$). Therefore, the answer is $16 - 3 = \boxed{13}.$

Extracting Answer from: 
Since the base-$b$ expansion of $2013$ ends in the digit $3$, $2013$ is one more than a multiple of $b$.  If $2013 = a b + 1$ for some integer $a$, then $$2013^{2} = (a b + 1)^{2} = a^{2} b^{2} + 2 a b + 1.$$Since we know that $b$ divides $a b$, we see that $b$ divides $(a b + 1)^{2} - (a b)^{2} = 2 a b + 1.$  Hence, $$2a \equiv -1 \pmod{b}.$$In particular, $2a > b$.

Also, from $(2676)_{9}$, we see that $b \le 8$, since $(2676)_{9} = 2 \cdot 9^{3} + 6 \cdot 9^{2} + 7 \cdot 9 + 6 = 2013$ is the base-$9$ representation of $2013$.

Now, we find the pairs $(a,b)$ that work for $b \le 8$.  If $b = 2$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}$, which is impossible.

If $b = 3$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.  We try $a = 1$ and $a = 2$, and find that $a = 1$ works: $2 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$.

If $b = 4$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, which is impossible.

If $b = 5$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, which implies $a \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$.  We try $a = 2$, $7$, and $12$, and find that $a = 7$ works: $14 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$.

If $b = 6$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$, which is impossible.

If $b = 7$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}$, which implies $a \equiv 11 \pmod{7}$.  We try $a = 11$ and $a = 18$, and find that $a = 11$ works: $22 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

If $b = 8$, then $2a \equiv -1 \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$, which is impossible.

Therefore, there are $\boxed{3}$ such values of $b$, namely $3$, $5$, and $7$.

If we first get a "common denominator" as if 3 and 13 represent real numbers rather than residues, we get $$\frac 13 + \frac 1{13} \equiv \frac{13 + 3}{39} \equiv \frac{16}{2 \cdot 19 + 1} \equiv \frac {16}1 \equiv \boxed{16} \pmod{19}.$$We can justify this as follows: let $a \equiv 3^{-1} \pmod{19}$ and $b \equiv 13^{-1} \pmod{19}$. Then $39a \equiv 13 \pmod{19}$ and $39b \equiv 3 \pmod{19}$. Summing these congruences shows that $39(a+b) \equiv a+b \equiv 13 + 3 \equiv 16 \pmod{19}$, so $a+b \equiv 16 \pmod{19}$, as desired.

Note that $14$, $46$, and $100$ all have a common factor of $2$, so we can divide it out: the solutions to $$14u \equiv 46 \pmod{100}$$ are identical to the solutions to $$7u \equiv 23 \pmod{50}.$$ Make sure you see why this is the case.

Now we can multiply both sides of the congruence by $7$ to obtain $$49u \equiv 161 \pmod{50},$$ which also has the same solutions as the previous congruence, since we could reverse the step above by multiplying both sides by $7^{-1}$. (We know that $7^{-1}$ exists modulo $50$ because $7$ and $50$ are relatively prime.)

Replacing each side of $49u\equiv 161$ by a $\pmod{50}$ equivalent, we have $$-u \equiv 11\pmod{50},$$ and thus $$u \equiv -11\pmod{50}.$$ This is the set of solutions to our original congruence. The two smallest positive solutions are $-11+50 = 39$ and $-11+2\cdot 50 = 89$. Their average is $\boxed{64}$.

Divide both sides by 31 to get $$n\equiv 31^{-1}\cdot 3\pmod{2293}.$$We seek the inverse of 31 modulo 2293. It suffices to find integers $p$ and $q$ such that $$31p+2293q=1.$$This is a linear Diophantine equation with solutions given by the extended Euclidean algorithm: $$\begin{array}{r@{=}c@{=}l}

We are given that $N\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ and $N\equiv 3\pmod{6}$.  We begin checking numbers which are 5 more than a multiple of 8, and we find that 5 and 13 are not 3 more than a multiple of 6, but 21 is 3 more than a multiple of 6. Thus 21 is one possible value of $N$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $x$ satisfying $x\equiv 5\pmod{8}$ and $x\equiv 3\pmod{6}$ are those of the form $x=21+\text{lcm}(6,8)k = 21 + 24 k$, where $k$ is an integer. Thus the 2 solutions less than $50$ are 21 and $21+24(1) = 45$, and their sum is $21+45=\boxed{66}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the amount of milk and coffee that each person drank be $m$ and $c$ respectively. Let $x$ be the number of people in the family. Then we know that each person drank an 8-ounce mixture, so $m+c=8$. We also know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee, so:

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{4}\cdot mx &= \frac{1}{6}\cdot cx\\
\frac{3}{4}\cdot mx &= \frac{5}{6}\cdot cx\\
3mx &= 10cx\\
3m &= 10c.
\end{align*}

We can substitute $c=\frac{8-m}{1}$ and $m=\frac{3}{10}c$ to get:

\begin{align*}
3m &= 10c\\
3\left(\frac{3}{10}c\right) &= 10\left(\frac{8}{10}c-\frac{1}{10}m\right)\\
\frac{9}{10}c &= \frac{16}{10}c - \frac{1}{10}m\\
\frac{1}{10}m &= \frac{7}{10}c\\
m &= 7c.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $k$ be the number of tiles.  There are two cases: If $k$ has twenty divisors, then we can divide them into ten pairs, which gives us 10 ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers.  Alternatively, if $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ is a square.  So other than the square case, there are $(19 - 1)/2 = 9$ ways to write $k$ as the product of two positive integers, which gives us a total of $9 + 1 = 10$ ways.

If the prime factorization of $k$ is $p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \dotsm p_n^{e_n},$ then the number of divisors of $k$ is
\[(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \dotsm (e_n + 1).\]Note that $e_i \ge 1$ for each $i,$ so each factor $e_i + 1$ is at least 2.

If $k$ has 19 divisors, then $k$ must be of the form $p^{18},$ where $p$ is prime.  The smallest number of this form is $2^{18} = 262144.$

Otherwise, $k$ has 20 divisors.  We want to write 20 as the product of factors, each of which are least 2.  Here are all the ways:
\[20 = 2 \cdot 10 = 4 \cdot 5 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5.\]Thus, we have the following cases:

(i). $k=p^{19}$ for some prime $p.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p=2,$ which gives $k=2^{19}.$

(ii). $k=pq^9$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2$ which gives $k=2^9\cdot3.$

(iii). $k=p^3 q^4$ for distinct primes $p$ and $q.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3$ and $q = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3^3=432.$

(iv). $k=pqr^4$ for distinct primes $p,$ $q,$ and $r.$ The smallest such $k$ is attained when $p = 3,$ $q = 5,$ and $r = 2,$ which gives $k=2^4\cdot3\cdot5=240.$

Therefore, the least number of tiles Emma could have is $\boxed{240}$ tiles.

Recall the identity $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b]\cdot \gcd(a,b)=ab$, which holds for all positive integers $a$ and $b$. Thus, $$\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] = \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{\gcd(9999,100001)},$$so we focus on computing $\gcd(9999,100001)$.

Notice that $100001 = 99990+11 = 10(9999)+11$. Therefore, any common divisor of $100001$ and $9999$ must be a divisor of $100001-10\cdot 9999 = 11$. The possibilities are $1$ and $11$.

In fact, $9999=11\cdot 909$, so $11$ is a divisor of $9999$ and $100001$, which gives $\gcd(9999,100001) = 11$.

Therefore, \begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{lcm}}[9999,100001] &= \frac{9999\cdot 100001}{11} \\
&= 909\cdot 100001 \\

First, we find $A$. The prime factorization of $500$ is $2^2 \cdot 5^3$. Therefore,  $$A=(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)=(7)(156).$$To see why $(1+2+2^2)(1+5+5^2+5^3)$ equals the sum of the divisors of 500, note that if you distribute (without simplifying), you get 12 terms, with each divisor of $2^2\cdot 5^3$ appearing exactly once.

Now we prime factorize $7 \cdot 156 = 7 \cdot 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 13$. The sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+7+13=\boxed{25}$.

First, we know that $x$ is even. Every prime number larger than $3$ is odd, so the sum of three members has to be even.

Now, $12$ does not work because $(2+10+12)+1=25$, which is not prime.

Similarly, $14$ does not work because $(2+4+14)+1=21$, which is not prime.

But $16$ works because all the possible sums involving $x=16$ generate prime results: $(2+4+16)+1=23$, $(2+10+16)+1=29$, and $(4+10+16)+1=31$.

So the smallest possible value of $x$ is $\boxed{16}$.

From the addition problem, we know that in the units digit, it's impossible to have $B+A=0_7$, so it must be that $B+A=10_7=7$. That means we carry a 1 to the next column and get $A+B+1=AA_7$. Since $B+A=10_7$, then $A+B+1=11_7$ and $A$ represents the digit 1. That tells us that $B+1=7$, so $B$ represents the digit 6. The product of $A$ and $B$ is $\boxed{6}$.

\]A cube that is a factor has a prime factorization of the form $2^p\cdot 3^q\cdot 5^r\cdot 7^s$, where $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$ are all multiples of 3. There are 3 possible values for $p$, which are  0, 3, and 6. There are 2 possible values for $q$, which are $0$ and $3$. The only value  for $r$ and for $s$ is 0.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $3!\cdot 5!\cdot 7!$ is $2^{10}\cdot 3^5\cdot 5^2\cdot 7^2$. The only cubes that divide this number are those whose powers of 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all multiples of 3. This leaves the exponents $3^3,$ $2^3\cdot 3,$ and $2\cdot 3^2$ for 3, and the possibilities of having either $2^3$ or $2\cdot 3$ (but not both) for 2. Thus we have $2$ choices for each of the prime factors except 5 and 7. In those cases, we may choose 0 or 3 as the power of $5$ or $7.$ Thus, the answer is $2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot (2\cdot 3)\cdot (3+1)\cdot (1+1) = \boxed{768}$.

Now we look at the units place. Either $M+M=M$ or $M+M=10+M$. In the second case, $2M=10+M\qquad\Rightarrow M=10$, which is not a possible digit. So it must be that $2M=M$, which is only possible if $M=0$. Now $2G=10\qquad\Rightarrow G=5$ and $E+1=G\qquad\Rightarrow E=4$. The numerical value of $E$ is $\boxed{4}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \cdot 10$ palindromes.

Next, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.

Now we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$

Therefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$

Since there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\frac{10}{90}=\boxed{\frac19}$.

$\textbf{Solution:}$ Observe that $9999$ is a multiple of $99$; therefore, all four-digit palindromes which are divisible by $99$ are multiples of $111,$ namely $1001,$ $1111,$ $1221,$ $1331,$ $1441,$ $1551,$ $1661,$ $1771,$ $1881,$ $1991,$ and $2222.$ There are $9$ four-digit palindromes which begin with $1$ or $2,$ and $90$ four-digit palindromes total ($9$ choices for the first digit, $10$ choices each for the next two, and $1$ choice for the last since it is already determined).

Suppose that 300 has $d$ divisors. The divisors of 300 can be split into $d/2$ pairs in such a way that the product of each pair is 300: $\{1,300\}, \{2,150\},$ etc. Thus $A=300^{d/2}$, which implies that $A$ has the same prime divisors as 300. Since the prime factorization of $300$ is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$, the sum of the prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+5=\boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The prime factorization of $300$ is $2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5^2$. Therefore, the divisors of $300$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the $2\cdot2\cdot 3 = 12$ ways to choose an exponent of $0$ or $1$ for each of the prime factors. We have that $\sigma_0(300) = 12$, since there are $12$ divisors of $300$. Let $d_1, d_2,\ldots, d_{12}$ represent the divisors of $300$. From this list of divisors, we can pair each divisor with another divisor such that their product is $300$. For example, $\{1, 300\}$ is a pair, and $\{10,30\}$ is another pair. There will be exactly six pairs. We can multiply all of the pairs together to get $300$ as a factor again, since $(d_i)(300/d_i) = 300$. Thus $A = 300^6$. The prime factorization of $300^6$ is $2^{12} \cdot 3^6\cdot 5^6$. Therefore, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$ is $2+3+5 = \boxed{10}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
The units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 can only be 4 or 9. Hence, the units digit of $X$ can only be 4 or 9. Let's start by assuming that the units digit is 4. In that case, $X$ is of the form $3k + 2$ for some integer $k$, and the number with units digit 4 that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 is of the form $5n + 4$ for some integer $n$. Equating the units digits of $X$ and $5n + 4$ gives us $k \equiv 2\pmod{5}$. The smallest possible integer $k$ of that form is $k = 2$, which gives us $X = 8$, which is not a valid solution (since 8 is not 2 more than a multiple of 3). The next possible value of $k$ is $k = 7$, which gives us $X = 23$. This is a valid solution, since 23 is 2 more than a multiple of 3 and its units digit is 4 more than a multiple of 5. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{23}$.

Since $2^n$ is a power of $2$, its only prime factor is $2$. So every odd integer is invertible modulo $2^n$ and every even integer is non-invertible modulo $2^n$. Among the positive integers less than $2^n$, there are precisely $\frac{2^n}{2}=2^{n-1}$ odd integers. Thus, \[k=2^{n-1}\equiv 2^{-1}2^n\equiv 7\cdot 3\equiv 21\equiv \boxed{8}\pmod {13}\]

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that an integer $a$ is invertible mod $2^n$ if and only if $\gcd(a,2^n)=1.$ So we want to count the number of integers less than $2^n$ which are relatively prime to $2^n$ where $2^n \equiv 3\pmod{13}$. Since $2^n\equiv3\pmod{13}$, we know that $2^n\equiv3\pmod{13}$ for all $n\geq 1$. This means that $2, 2^2, 2^3,\ldots$ are all equivalent to $3\pmod{13}$. We now compute the pattern of integer residues mod $13$:

$2^1\equiv3$
$2^2\equiv9$
$2^3\equiv5$
$2^4\equiv11$
$2^5\equiv7$
$2^6\equiv1$
$2^7\equiv2$
$\vdots$

We notice that the values of $2^n$ mod $13$ cycle through 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 11, 9, 5, 10, 7 with each cycle having 12 terms. Since $2^n\equiv 3\pmod{13}$, $n$ must lie in the sixth cycle. So we need to count the number of positive integers less than $2^6$ which are relatively prime to $2^6=64$. Using the standard technique for computing Euler's Totient Function yields $\phi(64)=32$.

Therefore, $k$ is a multiple of 32, so $k \equiv \boxed{0} \pmod{13}$.

\end{align*}Notice that the $C$ cancels out on both sides, so $C$ could be any valid digit that works in both base 4 and 9 (0, 1, 2, 3). Now we maximize $A$ with $A=3$ and solve $200=65(3)+5B$ to get $B=1$. If we take any smaller value for $A$, then $B$ will be too large to be a digit. So there is only one value of $A$, one value of $B$, and four possible values for $C$. The sum is $3+1+0+1+2+3=\boxed{10}$.

If $n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$, then we can write $n = 7k + 2$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this into $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$, we get \begin{align*}
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) &= (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6)\\
&= (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\\
&= 7(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(k + 1).
\end{align*} Since $7k + 4$ and $7k + 6$ are consecutive integers, one of them is divisible by 2, so $(7k + 4)(7k + 6)$ is divisible by 8. Also, either $k+1$ is divisible by 7, or $7k+4$ or $7k+2$ is divisible by 7, so $7(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(k + 1)$ is divisible by $7 \cdot 8$. Therefore, the remainder when $ (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7 is $\boxed{0}$.

Convert each dollar amount to cents and then add them up: $(27.47+35.23+37.37+26.52)\times 100 = 126590$. Thus, there was a total of $126590$ cents. We can ignore the dollar bills that they got from converting coins, since we're only looking for how many cents were leftover.

Prime factorize $284=2^2\cdot71$. The sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is
\begin{align*}
1+2+2^2+71+2 \cdot 71 &= (1+2+2^2)(1+71)-284 \\
&= 220 \\
&= 2^2\cdot5\cdot11.
\end{align*}Here we have used the observation that multiplying out $(1+2+2^2)(1+71)$ by distributing yields an expression which is the sum of all $6$ factors of $284.$ Applying this observation again, we find that the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $$(1+2+2^2)(1+5)(1+11)-220=7\cdot 6\cdot 12-220=\boxed{284}.$$

The sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220. The proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, and their sum is 284. Therefore, the sum of the proper divisors of the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is the sum of the proper divisors of 220, which is 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 = $\boxed{174}$.

We use the property that $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$ implies $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{m}$.

Since $129 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$ and $96 \equiv -3 \pmod{11}$, we have  $$129^{34}+96^{38} \equiv (-3)^{34}+(-3)^{38} \equiv 3^{34}+3^{38} \pmod{11}.$$Since $3^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{11},$ we can see that $3^{34} = (3^5)^{6} \cdot 3^4$ and $3^{38} = (3^5)^{7} \cdot 3^3.$

Then,  \begin{align*}

Extracting Answer from: 
$129 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$ and $96 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}$. So $129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 7^{34} + (-1)^{38} \pmod{11}$. We have $7^2 \equiv 5$, so $7^4 \equiv 3$, so $7^8 \equiv 9$, so $7^{16} \equiv 4$, and finally $7^{32} \equiv 5$. Therefore, $7^{34} \equiv 7^{32} \cdot 7^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 3 \pmod{11}$. Since $(-1)^n$ is always $1$ if $n$ is even and $-1$ if $n$ is odd, we have $(-1)^{38} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$. Adding modulo $11$, we find that $129^{34} + 96^{38}  \equiv 3 + 1 \equiv \boxed{4} \pmod{11}$.

We can write out what $11011_b$ means in terms of powers of $b$: $$11011_b = b^4+b^3+b+1.$$Multiplying this by $b-1$ gives \begin{align*}
11011_b &= (b-1)b^4 + (b-1)b^3 + (b-1)b + (b-1) \\
&= b^5 - b^4 + b^4 - b^3 + b^2 - b + b - 1 \\
&= b^5 - b^3 + b^2 - 1.
\end{align*}Now $$1001_b = b^3 + 1,$$so when we add this to the result above, we get $b^5+b^2$, which is written in base $b$ as $\boxed{100100}$.

Instead of taking this algebraic approach, you can also think in terms of base-$b$ long arithmetic (note that each $(b-1)$ below represents a single digit): $$\begin{array}{r *5{c@{~}}c}
&& 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\

\hline
& 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0

$P$ is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Since 16 is less than or equal to double 13, we only need to consider the factors of P up to 13. $P \equiv 0 \pmod{2}$, $P \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, $P \equiv 5 \pmod{5}$, $P \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$, and $P \equiv 11 \pmod{11}$. We also know that we only have to consider when $P \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{16}$ due to Euler's Totient theorem (since $\varphi(16) = 8$), so we need to look for the value of $P$ that satisfies these three congruences. Testing small values, we find that $P \equiv 11 \pmod{16}$ works. Thus, the remainder when $P$ is divided by 16 is $\boxed{11}$.
