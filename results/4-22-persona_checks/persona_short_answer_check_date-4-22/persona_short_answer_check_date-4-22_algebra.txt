Original File: datasets/MATH/MATH/test/algebra/1164.json
Extracting Answer from: 
Since the points $(-1,0)$ and $(5,0)$ have the same $y$-value, the axis of symmetry of the parabola must be between these 2 points.  The $x$-value halfway between $-1$ and $5$ is $x=2$.  Therefore the vertex of the parabola is equal to $(2,k)$ for some $k$ and the parabola may also be written as  \[a(x-2)^2+k.\] Now we substitute.  The point $(5,0)$ gives  \[0=a(5-2)^2+k,\] or  \[9a+k=0.\] The point $(0,5)$ gives  \[5=a(0-2)^2+k\] or  \[4a+k=5.\] Subtracting the second equation from the first gives  \[(9a+k)-(4a+k)=0-5\] so $5a=-5$, giving $a=-1$.

Since $a=-1$ and $9a+k=0$ we know that $k=9$ and our parabola is  \[ax^2+bx+c=-(x-2)^2+9.\] In order to compute $100a+10b+c$ we can substitute $x=10$ and that gives  \[100a+10b+c=-(10-2)^2+9=\boxed{-55}.\]

Answer from Original: -55

GPT File: datasets/persona_short_answer/persona_short_answer/algebra/1164_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
$-1$ is a root of the quadratic, so we know that $a(-1)^2+b(-1)+c=0$, which becomes $-a+b-c=0$.

We know that $(0,5)$ is on the parabola, so $a(0)^2+b(0)+c=5$, which tells us that $c=5$.

Finally, we know that $5$ is a root of the quadratic, so $a(5)^2+b(5)+c=0$, which becomes $25a+5b+c=0$.

Substituting for $c$ in the equations $-a+b-c=0$ and $25a+5b+c=0$, we get a system of two equations in two variables: \[\begin{aligned} -a+b-5&=0, \\ 25a+5b+5&=0. \end{aligned}\]Solving this system gives us $a=-\frac{1}{5}$ and $b=\frac{21}{5}$, so $100a+10b+c=\boxed{216}$.

We begin by factoring both quadratics. We find that the $18x^2+25x-3=0$ factors to: \[ (2x+3)(9x-1)=0. \]Thus, the only values of $x$ that satisfy this equation are $-\frac32$ and $\frac19$. When we factor the second quadratic, $4x^2+8x+3=0$, we find that it is equal to: \[ (2x+1)(2x+3)=0. \]Thus, the only values that satisfy this equation are $-\frac12$ and $-\frac32$. Since $-\frac32$ is the only root both polynomials have in common, the answer must be $\boxed{-\frac32}$

The solutions to the first equation can be found by factoring: 
$$18x^2+25x-3=(2x-1)(9x+3)=0.$$ 

The solutions to the second equation can also be found by factoring:

The graph of the two equations is shown below:

[asy]
Label f;

xaxis(-4,4,Ticks(f, 2.0));

yaxis(-1,9,Ticks(f, 2.0));

real f(real x)

}

draw(graph(f,-4,4), linewidth(1));
real g(real x)

{

return -x^2+8.75;

}

draw(graph(g,-3,3), linewidth(1));
[/asy]

We first find the $x$ values at which the two equations intersect. When $x\ge 0$, $y=|x|=x$. Plugging this into the second equation to eliminate $y$, we get $x=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}\Rightarrow x^2+x-\frac{35}{4}=0$. Factoring the left hand side gives $\left(x+\frac{7}{2}\right)\left(x-\frac{5}{2}\right)=0$, so $x=2.5$ (since we stated that $x$ was non-negative). By symmetry, the $x$ value of the left intersection is $x=-2.5$. So we just have to consider the integer $x$ values between these two bounds and find all integer $y$ values that make the point $(x,y)$ fall inside the region.

For $x=-2$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=2$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{19}{4}=4.75$, so all $y$ values between 2 and 4 inclusive work, for a total of 3 points. For $x=-1$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=1$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{31}{4}=7.75$, so all $y$ values between 1 and 7 inclusive work, for a total of 7 points. For $x=0$, the value of $y=|x|$ is $y=0$ and the value of $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ is $y=\frac{35}{4}=8.75$, so all $y$ values between 0 and 8 inclusive work, for a total of 9 points. By symmetry, when $x=1$, there are 7 points that work, and when $x=2$, there are 3 points that work.

In total, there are $3+7+9+7+3=\boxed{29}$ lattice points in the region or on the boundary.

label("$y=x$",(4.5,4.5),N,UnFill);
label("$y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$",(2,6.5),E,UnFill);
[/asy]

From the graph, we see that the region we're interested in is a triangle formed by $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$, $y=|x|$, and the $x$-axis. We split the analysis of the number of lattice points in the region into three parts: on and below $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$, on and above $y=|x|$, and in between the two curves.

First, we consider the region on and below $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$. We can think of this region as the set of lattice points under a parabolic arch. Since the vertex of this parabola is at $(0,\frac{35}{4})$, we can ignore the region where $y<0$ since there are no lattice points there. Similarly, we can ignore the quadrants with negative $x$ because we can reflect them to the positive side without losing any lattice points. Thus, we only need to consider the lattice points in the first quadrant.

Note that for any integer $x$ from 0 to 3, the quadratic $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ takes on integer values between $1$ and $8$. That means we have $8$ lattice points in the region of interest.

Second, we consider the region on and above $y=|x|$. We can think of this region as the set of lattice points above the two straight lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$. Note that if we reflect this region across the $y$-axis, we get the region from part 1. Thus, the number of lattice points in this region is also 8.

Finally, we consider the region in between the two curves. For any integer $x$ from $0$ to $2$, we have two integer values of $y$ since $y=-x^2+\frac{35}{4}$ intersects $y=|x|$. For $x=3$, we have $y=|x|$ intersecting the parabola at $(3,3)$ and $(-3,3)$, giving us a total of $5$ lattice points in the region in between the two curves.

In total, we have $8+8+5=\boxed{21}$ lattice points in the region.

Setting $x = 0,$ we get $f(0) = 9.$ Since $9 > 3,$ $f(9) = 9a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(0)) = f(9) = 9a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $9a + b = 0.$

Setting $x = 1,$ we get $f(1) = 7.$ Since $7 > 3,$ $f(7) = 7a + b.$ Hence, $$f(f(1)) = f(7) = 7a + b.$$But $f(f(x)) = x$ for all $x,$ so $7a + b = 1.$

Subtracting the equations $9a + b = 0$ and $7a + b = 1,$ we get $2a = -1,$ so $a = -1/2.$ From $9a + b = 0,$ we get $b = -9a = 9/2.$ Hence, $$a + b = -1/2 + (9/2) = \boxed{4}.$$

From $f(f(x)) = x,$
\begin{align*}
f(f(x)) &= f(\, f(x) \, ) \\
&= f(\, f(f(f(x))) \, ) \\
&= f(\, f(f(f(f(f(x)))) \, ) \\
&= f(\, f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x))))))) \\
& \quad \vdots
\end{align*}We can see that, as long as $x$ lies in the domain of the piecewise definition of $f,$ the result $x$ will eventually be obtained after repeating the composition $f(f(\dots(f(f(x)))\dots))$ enough times. Thus, we just need to find $f(x)$ and $f(f(x))$ for $x \le 3$ and $x > 3,$ and we will have found $a + b.$

If $x \le 3,$ then
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= 9 - 2x, \\
f(f(x)) &= f(9 - 2x) \\
&= a(9 - 2x) + b \\
&= 9a + (-2a)x + b.
\end{align*}Thus, we need $9a + b = 3$ and $-2a = -1,$ so $a = \frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -\frac{15}{2}.$

If $x > 3,$ then
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= ax + b, \\
f(f(x)) &= f(ax + b) \\
&= a(ax + b) + b \\
&= a^2 x + ab + b.
\end{align*}Thus, we need $a^2 = 1$ and $ab + b = 0.$ Since $a > 0,$ we have $a = 1.$ Then $b = 0,$ so $a + b = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$

Stripped String: 
From$f(f(x))=x,$\begin{align*}f(f(x))&=f(\,f(x)\,)\&=f(\,f(f(f(x)))\,)\&=f(\,f(f(f(f(f(x))))\,)\&=f(\,f(f(f(f(f(f(f(x)))))))\&\quad\vdots\end{align*}Wecanseethat,aslongas$x$liesinthedomainofthepiecewisedefinitionof$f,$theresult$x$willeventuallybeobtainedafterrepeatingthecomposition$f(f(\dots(f(f(x)))\dots))$enoughtimes.Thus,wejustneedtofind$f(x)$and$f(f(x))$for$x\le3$and$x>3,$andwewillhavefound$a+b.$If$x\le3,$then\begin{align*}f(x)&=9-2x,\f(f(x))&=f(9-2x)\&=a(9-2x)+b\&=9a+(-2a)x+b.\end{align*}Thus,weneed$9a+b=3$and$-2a=-1,$so$a=\frac{1}{2}$and$b=-\frac{15}{2}.$If$x>3,$then\begin{align*}f(x)&=ax+b,\f(f(x))&=f(ax+b)\&=a(ax+b)+b\&=a^2x+ab+b.\end{align*}Thus,weneed$a^2=1$and$ab+b=0.$Since$a>0,$wehave$a=1.$Then$b=0,$so$a+b=\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.$

If the given quadratic equation has one solution, it follows that its discriminant must be equal to $0$. The discriminant of the given quadratic is given by $m^2 - 4(m+n)$, and setting this equal to zero, we obtain another quadratic equation $m^2 - 4m - 4n = 0$. Since the value of $m$ is unique, it follows that again, the discriminant of this quadratic must be equal to zero. The discriminant is now $4^2 - 4(-4n) = 16 + 16n = 0$, so it follows that $n = \boxed{-1}$.

As the center of the circle is at the point $(-5,2)$ and its radius is $r$, the equation for the circle is $(x+5)^2+(y-2)^2=r^2$. Expanding this, \begin{align*}
x^2+10x+25+y^2-4y+4 &= r^2 \\
x^2 + y^2+10x-4y &= r^2-29.
\end{align*}Now, this equation must match the form $Ax^2 + 2y^2 + Bx + Cy = 40,$ so we see that we can multiply the above by two so that the coefficients for $y^2$ match: $$2x^2 + 2y^2+20x-8y= 2r^2-58.$$Thus, $A=2$, $B=20$, and $C=-8$. Also, $2r^2-58=40 \Rightarrow 2r^2=98 \Rightarrow r^2=49$. As $r$ is the radius, it must be positive, so $r=7$.
Therefore, $A+B+C+r= 2+20-8+7= \boxed{21}$.

\[(x+5)^2 + 2(y-2)^2 = r^2+25.\]Thus, the radius of the circle is $\sqrt{r^2+25}$ and we can rewrite the equation of the circle as
\[\frac{(x+5)^2}{\sqrt{r^2+25}} + \frac{2(y-2)^2}{\sqrt{r^2+25}} = 1.\]This is the equation of an ellipse with center $(-5,2)$ and semi-axes $\sqrt{r^2+25}$ and $\sqrt{\frac{r^2+25}{2}}.$

Thus, we have $A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+25}}$ and $B = C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}}.$ It follows that $A+B+C+r = \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+25}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}} + r.$ Multiplying the numerator and denominator of the second term by $\sqrt{2}$ gives a common denominator, so we can combine the two fractions to get
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2+25}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}} &= \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}}.
\end{align*}Therefore, the answer is $\frac{\sqrt{2}+1}{\sqrt{2(r^2+25)}}+r.$

\Rightarrow\qquad 4x+4y &= 8\\
\Rightarrow\qquad x+y &= 2.
\end{align*}Multiplying this equation by 725 and subtracting this equation from $725x+727y=1500$ gives \begin{align*}
(725x+727y) - 725(x+y) &= 1500-725(x+y) \implies \\

The absolute value of the product of two numbers is the product of their absolute values, so we can write  \[
|x^2-16|=|(x+4)(x-4)|=|x+4|\,|x-4|.
\]Since $|x^2-16|$ is written as the product of two positive integers, it is composite unless one of the integers is $1$.  Solving $|x+4|=1$, we observe that either $x+4=1$ or $x+4=-1$, which give solutions of $x=-3$ and $x=-5$.  Similarly, solving $|x-4|=1$ we find $x=3$ or $x=5$. Among the possible solutions $\{-5,-3,3,5\}$, only $\{-3,3\}$ yield a prime value for $|x+4|\,|x-4|$.  Therefore, the product of the integer values of $x$ for which $|x^2-16|$ is a prime number is $\boxed{-9}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two ways to do this quickly: Set $\frac{n^2-n}{2} = 55$, multiply both sides by 2, so that you have $n^2 - n = 110$.  Then, quickly notice that $n = 11$ is the only number conceivably close enough such that that equation will work (namely, $n = 10$ is too small, and $n = 12$ is too big, since 144 is way greater than 110.)  If you do the problem in this manner, you should do it all in your head so as to be able to do it more quickly (and you gain nothing from writing it out).

The other way is to quickly factor the numerator to $n(n-1)$, and once again multiply both sides by 2.  Then, you'll have $n(n-1) = 110$, from which you should recognize that both 10 and 11 are factors, from which you get $n = \boxed{11}$.

We can also solve this as a quadratic equation. $n(n-1) = 110$ becomes $n^2 - n - 110 = 0$. Factoring, we find that $(n - 11)(n + 10) = 0.$ This gives us $n = 11$ or $n = -10,$ but $n$ must be positive, so $n = \boxed{11}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are many ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to set up an equation based on the given formula and solve for $n$. We have:

$(n^2 - n)/2 = 55$

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

$n^2 - n = 110$

Rearranging and applying the quadratic formula yields:

$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 110}}{2}$

Simplifying under the square root gives:

$n = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{441}}{2}$

Since we want a positive integer solution, we take the positive root and simplify further:

$n = \frac{1 + 21}{2} = 11$

Therefore, there are 11 teams in the round-robin tournament.

$\textbf{Solution:}$ Given that $a,b,c,d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence, we can write $b=a+x$, $c=a+2x$ and $d=a+3x$ for some $x>0$. Also, $a,b,d$ form a geometric sequence, so we have $\dfrac{b}{a}=\dfrac{d}{b}\implies b^2=ad$. Substituting for $b$ and $d$, we get $(a+x)^2=a(a+3x)$. Simplifying, we get $x^2=2ax$, so $2x=a$.

Hence, $d=a+3x=a+6x/2=4a$. Thus, $\dfrac{a}{d}=\dfrac{a}{4a}=\boxed{\dfrac{1}{4}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$f^{-1}(x+4)=2f^{-1}(x)+1$ is an interesting equation. It hints at a recursive definition of $f^{-1}$. To see why, let $n$ be a non-negative integer and let $x$ be any real number. If we apply $f^{-1}$ to the left-hand side of the equation $n$ times, we get \begin{align*}
f^{-1}(x+4n)&=2f^{-1}(f^{-1}(x+4n-4)+1)+1 \\
&=2f^{-1}(f^{-1}(\dots f^{-1}(x+1)\dots)+1)+1\\
&=2^{n+1}f^{-1}(x)+2^n-1.
\end{align*} In particular, if we take $n=3$ and $x=f(2)$, we get $$f^{-1}(17)=2^4f^{-1}(5)+2^3-1=16f^{-1}(5)+7.$$ Our strategy is now to find $f^{-1}(5)$ and we can do that by inputting $x=5$ into the original equation $f^{-1}(x+4)=2f^{-1}(x)+1$.  This gives \begin{align*}
f^{-1}(9)&=2f^{-1}(5)+1, \\
f^{-1}(13)&=2f^{-1}(9)+1, \qquad\text{and} \\
f^{-1}(17)&=2f^{-1}(13)+1.
\end{align*} Since $f^{-1}(2)=5$ and we are given values of $f(2)$ and not $f^{-1}(5)$, we apply $f$ to both sides of $f^{-1}(2)=5$ to get $2=f(5)$ and $4=f(9)$ (by repeatedly applying $f^{-1}(x +4)=2f^{-1}(x)+1$). Finally, \begin{align*}
f^{-1}(5)&=\tfrac{1}{2}(f^{-1}(9)-1)=\tfrac{1}{2}(\tfrac{1}{2}(f^{-1}(13)-1)-1), \\

Extracting Answer from: 
We make the variable $x$ the number of adult patrons and $y$ the number of children patrons. Since the movie theater is full and seats $100$, $x+y=100$.

Adult tickets sell for $\$9.00$ each, so a total of $9x$ dollars were collected from adults. Children tickets sell for $\$5.00$ each, so a total of $5y$ dollars were collected from children. A total of $\$640$ were collected, so $9x+5y=640$.

We now have two equations, $x+y=100$ and $9x+5y=640$. We now solve for $y$.

We multiply the first equation by $9$ so that we can eliminate the $x$ term: $9x+9y=900$. Then, we subtract the second equation from it to get $9x+9y-(9x+5y)=900-640 \rightarrow 4y=260 \rightarrow y=65$.

Therefore, $\boxed{65 \text{ children tickets }}$ were sold.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the number of adult tickets sold and $y$ be the number of children's tickets sold. We have two equations based on the given information: 
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 100 \\
9x + 5y &= 640 \\
\end{align*}
Solving for $y$ in the first equation, we get $y = 100 - x$. Substituting this into the second equation, we get $9x + 5(100-x) = 640$, which simplifies to $4x = 140$ and $x=35$. Therefore, $y = 100 - x = 65$. So, $65$ children's tickets were sold.

Extracting Answer from: 
The minimum error in the measurement of the position of a particle is proportional to the uncertainty in its momentum, as given by Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Therefore, if the error in the measurement of the momentum of a particle is halved, the minimum error in the measurement of its position must double. To find the percentage increase, we calculate the difference between the new and old minimum errors and divide by the old minimum error, then multiply by 100 to get a percentage. Let $x$ be the old minimum error, then the new minimum error is $2x$, and the percentage increase is:
$$ \frac{2x - x}{x} \times 100\% = 100\% $$

Therefore, the minimum error in the measurement of the particle's position increases by 100%.

The three-digit number $abc$ is maximized when $a$ is maximized, and $a$ is maximized when $b$ is maximized, since 4, $a$, $b$ is a geometric sequence.  The largest digit is 9, so we'd like to find a digit $a$ such that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence.  The condition that 4, $a$, 9 is a geometric sequence is equivalent to $\frac{9}{a}=\frac{a}{4}$, which by clearing denominators is equivalent to $36=a^2$, which has solutions $a=\pm 6$.  One of these solutions is a digit, so $a=6$ and $b=9$ are the maximum values of $a$ and $b$.  If $b$, $c$, 5 is an arithmetic sequence, then the $c$ equals the average of $b$ and $5$, which is $(9+5)/2=7$.  So, $abc=\boxed{697}$.

Pam bought $5$ tickets with a $30\%$ discount: $$5 \times \$20 = \$100$$With a $30$ percent discount, she paid $\$100 * .70 = \$70.$

Thus Pam paid $\$70 - \$60 = \$\boxed{10}$ more than Susan.

Extracting Answer from: 
Pam pays $100-100(0.30)=70\%$ of the full price for each ticket, which is $\$14$ per ticket.

Susan pays $75\%$ of the full price for each ticket, which is $\$15$ per ticket.

Therefore, the difference in the cost of the tickets for Pam and Susan is $(14-15)\cdot 5 = -5.$

Thus, Susan pays $\$5$ less than Pam.

We complete the square for the first equation by adding $(-24/2)^2$ and $(-32/2)^2$ to both sides, which gives \[
(x^2-24x +144) +(y^2-32y +256)-16=0,
\] which is also equivalent to \[
(x-12)^2 +(y-16)^2 =4^2.
\] Similarly, the equation for the second circle is \[
(x+12)^2 +(y+16)^2 =4^2.
\] Hence, the centers of the circles are $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ respectively. Furthermore, the radii of the circles are equal to $4$.  Now the distance between the points $(12,16)$ and $(-12,-16)$ by the distance formula or similarity of $3-4-5$ triangles is $40$.  Therefore, to find the shortest distance between the two circles, we must subtract from $40$ the distances from the centers to the circles.  Thus, the shortest distance between the circles is $40-4-4 = \boxed{32}$.

We notice that both equations define circles centered at $(12,-16)$ and $(-12,16)$ respectively with radius of $\sqrt{16^2-384}=8\sqrt{10}$. The distance between the two centers is $\sqrt{(12-(-12))^2+(-16-16)^2}=32$. Since $32>2(8\sqrt{10})$, the circles aren't touching, and the distance is simply $32-2(8\sqrt{10})=\boxed{32-16\sqrt{10}}$.

First, we factor the denominator, to get \[\frac{x^2+5x+\alpha}{x^2 + 7x - 44} = \frac{x^2 + 5x + \alpha}{(x - 4)(x + 11)}.\]If this fraction can be expressed as a quotient of two linear functions, then the numerator must have either a factor of $x - 4$ or $x + 11$.

If the numerator has a factor of $x - 4$, then by the factor theorem, it must be 0 when $x = 4$.  Hence, $4^2 + 5 \cdot 4 + \alpha = 0$, which means $\alpha = -36$.

If the numerator has a factor of $x + 11$, then it must be 0 when $x = -11$.  Hence, $(-11)^2 + 5 \cdot (-11) + \alpha = 0$, which means $\alpha = -66$.

Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $\alpha$ is $-36 + (-66) = \boxed{-102}$.

Complete the square in the denominator: \[x^2+7x-44 = (x+3.5)^2 - 4.25.\]Thus the function becomes \[\frac{x^2+5x+\alpha}{(x+3.5)^2-4.25} = \frac{(x-p)(x-q)}{(x+3.5)^2-4.25}\]for some real numbers $p$ and $q.$

Expanding the right-hand side gives  \[x^2+5x+\alpha = A(x-p)(x-q)+B(x+3.5)^2+C\]for some constants $A,$ $B,$ and $C.$ Expanding the right-hand side and matching coefficients gives  \[\begin{aligned} A &= 1 \\ B &= A \\ -3.5^2A+C &= -4.25A+qA-pA+\alpha \\ C &= pBq. \end{aligned}\]Substituting the value of $A$ in the third equation gives $C = 2.25p,$ so then \[\alpha = -pA--qA-4.25A+2.25p=-3q-3p+3.25A.\]Thus we need to find all possible values of $\alpha.$ Since $p$ and $q$ are the roots of the quadratic, they are real numbers, so $3q+3p$ and $3.25A$ are real numbers as well, and thus $\alpha$ is a real number. Conversely, if $\alpha$ is a real number, then we can choose $A=1$, $p=0$, and $q=-\frac{\alpha}{3}$ to get such a quadratic.

Therefore, the set of all possible values of $\alpha$ is $\boxed{\text{all real numbers},}$ and the sum of all the elements of $S$ is undefined.

Extracting Answer from: 
First, we set $x^4=7x^2-10$, so $x^4-7x^2+10=0$. Note that $x=\pm 1$ is not a solution to this equation because $1^4-7\cdot 1^2+10=4$ and $(-1)^4-7\cdot (-1)^2+10=14$.

One way to proceed is to recognize that $x^4-7x^2+10=(x^2+a)(x^2+b)$ for constants $a$ and $b$ that we can find by expanding this product, so we have $x^4-7x^2+10=(x^2+a)(x^2+b)=x^4+(a+b)x^2+ab$. Therefore, we want to find constants $a$ and $b$ that satisfy $a+b=-7$ and $ab=10$. Notice that $a$ and $b$ must both be negative, since their product is positive and their sum is negative. Looking for two negative factors of 10 that add up to $-7$, we find $-2$ and $-5$, so $a=-2$ and $b=-5$. Thus, $x^4-7x^2+10=(x^2-2)(x^2-5)$, and we have $\sqrt{m}=\sqrt{5}$ and $\sqrt{n}=\sqrt{2}$, so $m-n=5-2=\boxed{3}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We are told that the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength. Thus, if we have a photon whose energy is $2000$ times greater than that of a photon of red light, the wavelength of the higher-energy photon will be $1/2000$th that of the wavelength of red light. So, the wavelength of the high-energy photon is $$\frac{1}{2000} \cdot 7 \times 10^{-7} = 3.5 \times 10^{-10}.$$Therefore, $a+b=3+(-10)=\boxed{-7}$.

Then the total cost by that time is $$10000+650x,$$ and the total amount saved in energy bills is $$1200x.$$ Since we want to know when the two are equal, we have the equation $$10000+650x = 1200x.$$ Solving for $x$, we get $$x=\frac{10000}{550}=18.\overline{18}.$$ Rounding up, we see it takes $\boxed{19}$ years to recuperate the cost.

Let the constant term of Charles's quadratic be $c$, and the constant term of Eric's quadratic be $d$.

Extracting Answer from: 
$ab=(a+b)^2-(a^2+2ab+b^2)= 4(a+b)-\big((a+b)^2-4ab\big)=4(a+b)-(b^2-4ac)$.
Hence $\frac{b^2-4ac}{a+b}=\frac{k}{4}$ for some constant $k$.
Thus, $4a+4b=\frac{4ac+k}{b^2-4ac}=\frac{4kc}{b^2-4ac}$, so that
\[16(a+b)^2=16(a+b)\cdot\frac{4kc}{b^2-4ac} \implies (4a+b-2kc)(4b+a-2kc)=4kc(b^2-4ac).\]
Thus, $4a+b=2kc+d$, $4b+a=2kc+e$, and $de=4kc$, so that $d,e$ are of opposite sign. Hence, $2kc=(2k)(2\sqrt{c})(-2\sqrt{d})$, so $c$ must be a square, and $d$ must be a nonsquare. 
Write $c=r^2$, $d=s^2$. So, $4krs=r^2e-s^2d$, $s^2d-r^2e=-4krs$. Thus, $s^2d \equiv r^2e \mod r^2+s^2$. (Since $s^2d=r^2e-4krs$, this motivates us to make the change of variables $x=r, y=r+s$ so that we can use the Euclidean algorithm.) Note that $\displaystyle \gcd(s^2,r^2+s^2)=\gcd(r^2,s^2)$, so $s^2d \equiv r^2e \equiv -r^2s^2 \mod r^2+s^2$. Thus, $s^2 \equiv -d \mod {r^2+s^2}$. Hence $\frac{s^2+d}{r^2+s^2}$ is a positive integer.
The ratio of the constant terms is $\frac{k}{4ac}$. Thus $4ac=k(r^2+s^2)$. Since $c$ is a square and $d$ is a nonsquare, $ac$ is not a square, so $k$ is not a square. Hence $\frac{k}{4ac}$ is not a square. Letting $k(r^2+s^2)=4ac$, we see that this becomes $\frac{1}{k}=\frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac}$, and since $\frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac}$ is a positive integer, $k$ is a square. 
Now, let $k=p^2$, where $p$ is prime. Then $r^2+s^2 = \frac{4ac}{p^2}$, and $\frac{c}{p},\frac{a}{p}$ are not both perfect squares. Also, $s^2+d = \frac{r^2+s^2+d}{2} = \frac{r^2+e}{2} \equiv 1 \pmod 2$, so $s^2+d$ is not a perfect square. Thus by quadratics being conjugates \[4e = (4)(1)(d) + (2b)(2a) = s^2d+d^2+(b^2-4dc) = (d+s^2)^2+(b-2ds)^2-(b^2+4d^2),\] which implies that $b=2ds$ and that $4e-a^2-4c^2 = 4d^2$. Thus, $4ac=k(r^2+s^2)$ $=pk\cdot \frac{4ac}{p^2}$, so $p=k$, and $r^2+s^2=p\cdot 4ac$. Thus, $a$ and $c$ are not both perfect squares, and \[\frac{k}{4ac} = \frac{p^2}{4ac} = \frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac} = p = k\] and so $k=1$. It follows that $r^2+s^2=4ac$.
With $c=r^2$, we now look at
\[4a+4b=b^2-4ac \implies (2a+b)^2+b^2=4b^2+4ac.\]Since $4ac$ is a square and $\gcd(2a+b,b)=\gcd(b,r)=1$, we have:

either $2a+b=m^2-n^2, b=2mn,4ac=m^2+n^2$ for some relatively prime $m>n>0$, or,
$2a+b=2mn, b=m^2-n^2, 4ac=4mn(m^2-n^2)$ for some relatively prime $m>n>0$.

Now, we take cases on whether $a$ is a perfect square or not:
If $a$ is a nonsquare:

In Case 1, $b=2mn=2ac/(m^2-n^2)$ is not a perfect square, contradiction.
In Case 2, $2a+b=2mn$ and $m^2-n^2=\frac{b^2}{c}=4m^2n^2/(m^2+n^2)$ is not a perfect square, contradiction.

If $a$ is a perfect square:

In Case 1, we have $2a+b=m^2-n^2$ and $\frac{4ac}{m^2-n^2}=b=2mn$ is a perfect square. Set $u=m/n$ and rewrite as $2a+b=n(u^2-1), 4ac=n^2(u^2-1)^2$, so $c=n\left(\frac{u^2-1}{2}\right)^2$ and $4a+b = 2n(u^2+1)$, so $u$ is rational. Then $4ac$ is a square forces $u$ to be integral, and hence $(u,n)$ is one of $(2,1),(5,2)$.
In Case 2, we have $2a+b=2mn$ and $b=m^2-n^2$ and $\frac{4ac}{m^2-n^2}$ is a perfect square. Then $m>n>0$ are coprime and have different parity. Since $c$ is a square, $4a+b=4mn-p$ for some $p$. Also $4a-b=4(m^2-n^2)$, so $4a=(2m+n)(2m-n)$. Thus $2m-n$ is even, so $m\equiv n\equiv 1\pmod{2}$ and $m>n,x=m+n,y=m-n$ satisfy $x>y$. Then $x^2-y^2=b\not\equiv 0\pmod{4}$, so $a=x^2-y^2,q=xy/2$. Then $c=[(x-y)/2]^2$ and $b=2q$. If for some prime $r$ we define $r'$ through $r^2+s^2=4ac=r'^2$, then $r'<r<2q/r'$. We see that $r=5,q=12$ works.

Hence, the only such pair of quadratics is \[(x^2-2xy+y^2+4x+8y+16)(x^2+2xy+y^2+4x-8y+16).\]thus the answer is $16+16+8=\boxed{040}$.

$ab=(a+b)^2-(a^2+2ab+b^2)=4(a+b)-\big((a+b)^2-4ab\big)=4(a+b)-(b^2-4ac)$.Hence$\frac{b^2-4ac}{a+b}=\frac{k}{4}$forsomeconstant$k$.Thus,$4a+4b=\frac{4ac+k}{b^2-4ac}=\frac{4kc}{b^2-4ac}$,sothat\[16(a+b)^2=16(a+b)\cdot\frac{4kc}{b^2-4ac}\implies(4a+b-2kc)(4b+a-2kc)=4kc(b^2-4ac).\]Thus,$4a+b=2kc+d$,$4b+a=2kc+e$,and$de=4kc$,sothat$d,e$areofoppositesign.Hence,$2kc=(2k)(2\sqrt{c})(-2\sqrt{d})$,so$c$mustbeasquare,and$d$mustbeanonsquare.Write$c=r^2$,$d=s^2$.So,$4krs=r^2e-s^2d$,$s^2d-r^2e=-4krs$.Thus,$s^2d\equivr^2e\modr^2+s^2$.(Since$s^2d=r^2e-4krs$,thismotivatesustomakethechangeofvariables$x=r,y=r+s$sothatwecanusetheEuclideanalgorithm.)Notethat$\displaystyle\gcd(s^2,r^2+s^2)=\gcd(r^2,s^2)$,so$s^2d\equivr^2e\equiv-r^2s^2\modr^2+s^2$.Thus,$s^2\equiv-d\mod{r^2+s^2}$.Hence$\frac{s^2+d}{r^2+s^2}$isapositiveinteger.Theratiooftheconstanttermsis$\frac{k}{4ac}$.Thus$4ac=k(r^2+s^2)$.Since$c$isasquareand$d$isanonsquare,$ac$isnotasquare,so$k$isnotasquare.Hence$\frac{k}{4ac}$isnotasquare.Letting$k(r^2+s^2)=4ac$,weseethatthisbecomes$\frac{1}{k}=\frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac}$,andsince$\frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac}$isapositiveinteger,$k$isasquare.Now,let$k=p^2$,where$p$isprime.Then$r^2+s^2=\frac{4ac}{p^2}$,and$\frac{c}{p},\frac{a}{p}$arenotbothperfectsquares.Also,$s^2+d=\frac{r^2+s^2+d}{2}=\frac{r^2+e}{2}\equiv1\pmod2$,so$s^2+d$isnotaperfectsquare.Thusbyquadraticsbeingconjugates\[4e=(4)(1)(d)+(2b)(2a)=s^2d+d^2+(b^2-4dc)=(d+s^2)^2+(b-2ds)^2-(b^2+4d^2),\]whichimpliesthat$b=2ds$andthat$4e-a^2-4c^2=4d^2$.Thus,$4ac=k(r^2+s^2)$$=pk\cdot\frac{4ac}{p^2}$,so$p=k$,and$r^2+s^2=p\cdot4ac$.Thus,$a$and$c$arenotbothperfectsquares,and\[\frac{k}{4ac}=\frac{p^2}{4ac}=\frac{r^2+s^2}{4ac}=p=k\]andso$k=1$.Itfollowsthat$r^2+s^2=4ac$.With$c=r^2$,wenowlookat\[4a+4b=b^2-4ac\implies(2a+b)^2+b^2=4b^2+4ac.\]Since$4ac$isasquareand$\gcd(2a+b,b)=\gcd(b,r)=1$,wehave:either$2a+b=m^2-n^2,b=2mn,4ac=m^2+n^2$forsomerelativelyprime$m>n>0$,or,$2a+b=2mn,b=m^2-n^2,4ac=4mn(m^2-n^2)$forsomerelativelyprime$m>n>0$.Now,wetakecasesonwhether$a$isaperfectsquareornot:If$a$isanonsquare:InCase1,$b=2mn=2ac/(m^2-n^2)$isnotaperfectsquare,contradiction.InCase2,$2a+b=2mn$and$m^2-n^2=\frac{b^2}{c}=4m^2n^2/(m^2+n^2)$isnotaperfectsquare,contradiction.If$a$isaperfectsquare:InCase1,wehave$2a+b=m^2-n^2$and$\frac{4ac}{m^2-n^2}=b=2mn$isaperfectsquare.Set$u=m/n$andrewriteas$2a+b=n(u^2-1),4ac=n^2(u^2-1)^2$,so$c=n(\frac{u^2-1}{2})^2$and$4a+b=2n(u^2+1)$,so$u$isrational.Then$4ac$isasquareforces$u$tobeintegral,andhence$(u,n)$isoneof$(2,1),(5,2)$.InCase2,wehave$2a+b=2mn$and$b=m^2-n^2$and$\frac{4ac}{m^2-n^2}$isaperfectsquare.Then$m>n>0$arecoprimeandhavedifferentparity.Since$c$isasquare,$4a+b=4mn-p$forsome$p$.Also$4a-b=4(m^2-n^2)$,so$4a=(2m+n)(2m-n)$.Thus$2m-n$iseven,so$m\equivn\equiv1\pmod{2}$and$m>n,x=m+n,y=m-n$satisfy$x>y$.Then$x^2-y^2=b\not\equiv0\pmod{4}$,so$a=x^2-y^2,q=xy/2$.Then$c=[(x-y)/2]^2$and$b=2q$.Ifforsomeprime$r$wedefine$r'$through$r^2+s^2=4ac=r'^2$,then$r'<r<2q/r'$.Weseethat$r=5,q=12$works.Hence,theonlysuchpairofquadraticsis\[(x^2-2xy+y^2+4x+8y+16)(x^2+2xy+y^2+4x-8y+16).\]thustheansweris$16+16+8=\boxed{040}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Notice that by the logarithmic identity $\log(x) - \log(y) = \log\frac{x}{y}$, the equations are equivalent to $\log\frac{x}{y}=a$, $\log\frac{y}{z}=15$, and $\log\frac{z}{x}=-7$ respectively. Adding all three equations together yields $\log\frac{x}{y} + \log\frac{y}{z} + \log\frac{z}{x} = a + 15 - 7$. From the identity $\log (x) + \log (y) = \log (xy)$, we obtain $\log\left(\frac{x}{y}\cdot\frac{y}{z}\cdot\frac{z}{x}\right) = a + 8$. Cancelations result in $\log(1) = a + 8$. Since $\log(1) = 0$, we find $a = \boxed{-8}$.

Add the first and third equation to get $\log \frac xy \cdot \frac zx = a - 7.$ But $\frac xy \cdot \frac zx = \frac{x}{y} \cdot \frac{z}{x} = \frac{z}{y},$ so $\log \frac zy = a - 7 - 15 = a - 22.$ Thus, $a - 22 = \log \frac zy = -\log \frac yz = 7,$ so $a = \boxed{29}.$
