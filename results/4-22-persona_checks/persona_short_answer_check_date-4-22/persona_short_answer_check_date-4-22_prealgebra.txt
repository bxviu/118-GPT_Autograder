Let the number of losses for Kyle's team be $3x$. Thus, the number of wins for Kyle's team is $2x$. If the team had played the same number of games ($5x$) but won twice as many of its games, the team would have won $4x$ games and lost the remaining $5x-4x=x$ games. The ratio of losses to wins would then be $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.

GPT File: datasets/persona_short_answer/persona_short_answer/prealgebra/1090_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
The ratio of losses to wins is 3 to 2, which means that for every 3 losses there are 2 wins. Let's say the team played a total of 5 games (3 losses and 2 wins). If they had won twice as many games, they would have won 4 games and lost 1 game. 

The new ratio of losses to wins would be 1 to 4 since they lost only 1 game and won 4 games. 

Therefore, the ratio of losses to wins would have been 1/4.

Extracting Answer from: 
Using the 30-60-90 triangle ratios, we know that the shorter leg is $\frac12$ of the hypotenuse. Since the shorter leg is 8, the hypotenuse is $8\cdot 2 = 16$. Now using the right triangle with hypotenuse 16 and leg 8, we know that the other leg (which has length $x$) is $\sqrt{16^2-8^2} = \sqrt{192} = 8\sqrt{3}$. Therefore, $x = \boxed{8\sqrt{3}}$.

Stripped String:

Let the number of left-handed boys be $x$. Then the number of right-handed boys is $4x$. Let the number of left-handed girls be $2x$, so the total number of left-handed people is $x+2x=3x$. Since $3x$ people are left-handed and half of the girls are left-handed, there are $2x$ left-handed girls and $x$ left-handed boys. Adding up all the different groups, we have $x+4x+2x+2x+0.5 \cdot 2x=36$. Solving, we get $x=4$. So the number of right-handed boys is $4x=\boxed{16}$.

Let $d$ represent the number of days of practice. The number of miles run by each girl can be expressed as $3+6(d-1)$ and the number of miles run by each boy is $5d$. The girls will have outrun the boys after $d$ days if $3+6(d-1)>5d$. We solve this inequality as follows: \begin{align*}
3+6(d-1) &> 5d \quad \implies \\
3+6d-6 &> 5d \quad \implies \\
6d-5d &> 6-3 \quad \implies \\

Extracting Answer from: 
Each girl will have run 4 miles by the end of the first day (3 miles + 1 additional mile). After that, they will run 6 additional miles every day of practice. Each boy will run 5 miles per day. In order to determine when each girl's total mileage surpasses each boy's, we can set up the following inequality:

4 + 6x > 5x

Where x is the number of additional days of practice. Solving for x, we get:

4 + x > 0

x > -4

Since we can't have negative days of practice, we'll round up to the nearest whole number, giving us x = 1. So each girl will have run a total of 10 miles (4 on the first day + 6 on the following day) when the coach orders the new equipment.

The red triangle we've drawn has angles $\angle CAB=30^\circ$ and since the exterior angle at $B$ is $90^{\circ}$, \[\angle ABC=180^\circ-90^\circ=90^\circ.\]Angle $x$ and $\angle{BCA}$ are vertical angles and their measures are therefore equal. So, it suffices to find the measure of $\angle{BCA}$.

The angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$, so  \[\angle BCA=180^\circ-30^\circ-90^\circ=\boxed{60^\circ}.\]

Clearly the long light and dark gray strips along the four sides are identical, so they have the same area.  The only leftover dark gray pieces are the four $1\,\mathrm{in}\times 2\,\mathrm{in}$ pieces in the corners.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let the lengths of the sides of the inner strip be $x$ and $y$. Then the lengths of the sides of the outer rectangle are $x+2$ and $y+2$. 

This means that outer area of the frame is $(x+2)(y+2)$ and the inner area is $xy$. We are given that the inner area is 100 $\text{in}^2$ which means that $xy = 100$. Thus:
\begin{align*}
(x+2)(y+2) &= xy + 2x+2y+4\\
&= 100 + 2x+2y+4\\
&= 2(x+y+52).
\end{align*}
Now we must find $x+y+52$. To do this, we note that: 
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^2 &= x^2 + y^2 + 2xy\\
&= (x^2 + y^2 + 4) - 4 - 2xy\\
&= (x+2)^2 + (y+2)^2 - 4 - 4xy\\
&= (x+2)^2 + (y+2)^2 - 404
\end{align*}
since $xy=100$. Thus, $x+y = \sqrt{(x+y)^2} \approx 18.2$. Therefore, the area of the outer frame is $2(18.2+52)=\boxed{140.4}$ square inches approximately.

Stripped String:

Extracting Answer from: 
The number 1 to any power is always 1, so no matter how many times Hypatia and Euclid cube their numbers, they will both always have the number 1. Thus, Hypatia and Euclid both write down the number 1.


Now, lets take a look at Pythagoras. He keeps cubing his result 20 times starting with the number 2. The numbers he has are \begin{align*}
2^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}8 \\
8^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}512 \\
512^3&\underset{\swarrow}{=}134217728 \\
\vdots
\end{align*}We can see that these numbers get out of hand pretty quickly (no wonder it took them so long), so instead, we look at the sum of the results because that is what we are trying to find. Recall that $(-a)^3=-a^3$. Because the number Ptolemy chose is the negation of what Pythagoras chose, after a certain number of cubes, whatever Pythagoras has, Ptolemy will have the opposite of that. Thus, whatever gigantic number Pythagoras has at the end of the game, Ptolemy will have the negation of that number, and they will add to zero.

Thus, our desired sum is  \begin{align*}1+1&+(\text{some huge number}) + (-\text{the same huge number})\\
&=1+1+0=\boxed{2}.
\end{align*}

Extracting Answer from: 
Let $x$ be the average score Heidi has on her first $6$ tests. Then her total points for those $6$ tests is $6x$. Her goal is to achieve a $90$-point semester average, which means she is aiming for a total of $90 \cdot 8 = 720$ points (since there are $8$ tests worth of points total). If we let $y$ be the score Heidi gets on the final exam, then we know $y\ge 99$ since otherwise, she would achieve less than a $90$-point average. Therefore, her total score for the semester will be $6x+y$. We want this to equal $720$. Thus, we have the equation $6x+y=720$. However, we have one more equation: we know that if Heidi scores a $99$ on the final, she will achieve a $90$-point average. This means that her total score for the semester will be equal to $(6x+y)+2(99)=6x+y+198$. Setting this equal to $720$, we get $6x+y+198=720$. Subtracting the first equation from this one, we get that $198=720-6x-y-(6x+y)$ or \[
720-2(6x+y) = 198\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad 6x+y = 261.
\]So, we have a system of equations \[
\begin{cases}
6x+y=720 \\
6x+y=261
\end{cases}
\]Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $459=0$, which is clearly impossible. Therefore, there is no solution, and we cannot answer the question as posed.

This amounts to multiplying by $0.8$.  Overall, we went from $100\%$ to $90\%\times 80\%= 72\%$ of its beginning value, which means we lost $\boxed{28}\%$ of our initial investment.

From each vertex $V$, we can draw 2 diagonals: one to each vertex that is not $V$ and does not share an edge with $V$.  There are 5 vertices in a pentagon, so we might be tempted to say the answer is $5\times 2 = 10$.  However, note that this counts each diagonal twice, one time for each vertex.  Hence there are $\frac{10}{2} =\boxed{ 5}$ distinct diagonals in a convex pentagon.

There are a total of 5 vertices in a convex pentagon, which means that we can choose 2 of them to draw a straight line between, creating a diagonal. However, we must be sure not to overlap any diagonals or draw any diagonals that are one of the sides of the pentagon itself. Using this logic, we get 5 choose 2 (or 5C2) diagonals, which is equal to 10. Therefore, there are 10 distinct diagonals of a convex pentagon that can be drawn.

Subtract 3 and divide by 4 on both sides of the first inequality to obtain \begin{align*}
4n + 3 &< 25 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 4n &< 22 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad n &< 5.5.
\end{align*}Similarly, the second inequality yields \begin{align*}
-7n + 5 &< 24 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad -7n &< 19 \\
\Rightarrow\qquad n &> -\frac{19}{7}.
\end{align*}Therefore, we are looking for all the integers between $-\frac{19}{7}$ and $5.5$. Since $-\frac{19}{7}$ is between $-3$ and $-2$ and the largest integer less than $5.5$ is 5, we need to count the number of integers between $-2$ and $5$, inclusive. There are $5$ positive integers, $2$ negative integers, and zero, so there are $\boxed{8}$ integers that satisfy both $4n + 3 < 25$ and $-7n + 5 < 24$.

Remember, even powers of $-1$ equal $1$, and odd powers of $-1$ equal $-1$.  Therefore, $x + x^2 = -1 + (-1)^2 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  The next pair cancels out in the same way: $x^3 + x^4 = (-1)^3 + (-1)^4 = -1 + 1 = 0$.  Now, it is easy to see that the pattern continues for every pair of powers, all the way up to $x^{2009} + x^{2010}$.  Notice that $x^{2011}$ is the only power that hasn't been canceled out.  Therefore, the answer is $(-1)^{2011} = \boxed{-1}.$

Both the numerator and the denominator share common factors of 2 and 5, so they cancel: $\frac{3 \cdot \cancel{5} \cdot \cancel{2}}{\cancel{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cancel{5}} = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 2}$.

Convert both decimals into fractions. \begin{align*}
x&=.\overline{2} \\
\Rightarrow 10x&=2.\overline{2} \\
\Rightarrow 9x&=2 \\
\Rightarrow x &= \frac{2}{9}.
\end{align*}Likewise, $.\overline{6}=\frac{6}{9}$. Adding the two fractions yields $\frac{2}{9} + \frac{6}{9}=\frac{8}{9}$. The reciprocal of this is $\frac{1}{\frac{8}{9}}=\frac{9}{8}$. To convert this to a decimal, we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by 125. Doing so, we get \[\frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{125}{125} = \frac{9 \cdot 125}{8 \cdot 125} = \frac{1125}{1000}=\boxed{1.125}.\]

If we can express this number as a single power of 10, then we can directly find the number of zeroes at the end of the numbers. Recall that $10^n$ has $n$ zeroes at the end of it. We must start with parentheses first. Recall that $\left( a^m \right) ^n = a^{mn}$. Because of this, we can rewrite the last term as $10^{15 \cdot 4}=10^{60}$. Finally, recall the rules of division and multiplication of exponents: $a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}$ and $a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$. Using these we can carry out the multiplication and division from left to right to get \begin{align*}
(10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div \left(10^{15}\right)^4 &= (10^5 \cdot 10^{77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\
&=(10^{5+77} \div 10^{15}) \div 10^{60} \\
&=(10^{82} \div 10^{15} )\div 10^{60} \\

&=10^{67} \div 10^{60} \\
&=10^{67-60} \\

First, we simplify a small portion of the question: $\frac{8}{9} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 = \frac{2^3}{9} \cdot \frac{1^4}{2^4}$.  Multiplying these two and combining numerator and denominator, we get $\frac{1 \cdot 2^3}{9 \cdot 2^4}$, which can be made into two fractions and simplified: $\frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{2^3}{2^4} = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{18}$.

The inverse of this fraction is $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{18}} = 18$, and $18-17 = \boxed{1}$.

We know that one dragonfruit is $x-4$ dollars.  This means that one rambutan is $(x-4) + 2x = 3x-4$ dollars.  Then, one starfruit is $(3x-4) -5 = 3x-9$ dollars. We want to find $1 \cdot (3x-4) + 2 \cdot (3x-9) + 3 \cdot (x-4)$.  Distributing these three smaller expressions gives us $(3x-4) + (6x-18) + (3x-12)$. Finally, we combine like terms, yielding $(3x + 6x + 3x) + (-4 + -18 + -12) = (12x) + (-34)$.  We obtain $\boxed{12x -34}$, or $\boxed{-34 + 12x}$.

The cost of one rambutan is $(x-4)+2x=(3x-4)$ dollars. The cost of two starfruit is the cost of one rambutan minus five dollars, so it is $(3x-4)-5=(3x-9)$ dollars. Three dragonfruit cost 3 times the cost of one dragonfruit, which is 3 times $(x-4)=3x-12$ dollars. So the total cost is $(3x-4)+(3x-9)+3(3x-12)=\boxed{12x-53}$ dollars.

Suppose I am $y$ years old now.  My brother is 4 times as old as I am, so my brother's age is $4y$. Six years from now, my brother will be $4y+6$ years old and I will be $y+6$ years old. Since my brother will be twice as old as I am at that time, we must have \[4y+6 = 2(y+6).\]Expanding the right side gives $4y + 6 = 2y + 12$. Subtracting $2y$ from both sides gives $2y + 6 = 12$, and subtracting 6 from both sides gives $2y = 6$.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives $y = 3$.  The question asks for the age of my brother now, which is $4y = \boxed{12}$.  (Always make sure you answer the question.)

We first have to find what fraction of students walk to school. Since the total fraction of students is $\frac{120}{120}$ or 1, we must find:\[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{2}{5} - \frac{5}{12}.\]To solve this expression, we have to get common denominators. In this case, the common denominator is 120.

To get this common denominator for the fraction $\frac{2}{5}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 24 to get $\frac{48}{120}$.

To get the common denominator for $\frac{5}{12}$, multiply the numerator and denominator by 10 to get $\frac{50}{120}$. So now we have: \[\frac{120}{120} - \frac{48}{120} - \frac{50}{120} = \frac{120 - 48 - 50}{120} = \frac{22}{120}.\]Notice that $\frac{22}{120}$ can be written as $\frac{2\cdot11}{2\cdot60}$, so our final answer is $\boxed{\frac{11}{60}}$.

We first look for the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  (Recall that a proper factor of a positive integer $n$ is a factor other than 1 or $n$).  Since $54,\!321$ is not even, we try 3.  The sum of the digits of $54,\!321$ is 15, which is divisible by 3.  Therefore, 3 is the smallest proper factor of $54,\!321$.  It follows that the largest proper factor is $54,\!321/3=\boxed{18,\!107}$.  (Note: to see that $n/d$ is the largest proper factor of an integer $n$ whose smallest proper factor is $d$, observe that if $f$ were a proper factor larger than $n/d$, then $n/f$ would be a proper factor smaller than $d$).

It is almost always easier to use fractions than decimals when dividing. So the first task is to convert these repeating decimals to fractions. First, $.0\overline{3}$: \[
10 \cdot .0\overline{3} = .\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3}\\
\Rightarrow .0\overline{3} = \frac{1}{3} \div 10 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30}.
\]Next, $.\overline{03}$: \[
99 \cdot .\overline{03} = (100-1) \cdot .\overline{03} = 3.\overline{03} - .\overline{03} = 3\\
\Rightarrow .\overline{03} = \frac{3}{99} = \frac{3}{3 \cdot 33} = \frac{1}{33}.
\]We now have the tools to make our calculation: \begin{align*}
.0\overline{3} \div .\overline{03} &= \frac{1}{30} \div \frac{1}{33}= \frac{1}{30} \cdot \frac{33}{1}\\
&= \frac{33}{30} = \frac{3 \cdot 11}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{11}{10}\\
&= \frac{10+1}{10} = \boxed{1\frac{1}{10}}.

Extracting Answer from: 
$\angle A = x+26^\circ$ and $\angle B = 2x+10^\circ$ are angles formed by a line intersecting two parallel lines. Therefore, $\angle A + \angle B = 180^\circ$. We can write this as $x + 26^\circ + 2x + 10^\circ = 180^\circ$. Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get:

\begin{align*}
3x + 36^\circ &= 180^\circ \\
3x &= 144^\circ \\
x &= 48^\circ
