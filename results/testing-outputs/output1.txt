Answer from ChatGPT : Thelargesttwhichwillbringtheamusementparkaprofitgreaterthan\4200is100.

**Solution:**

Thecostofoneticketis\70.TherevenuefromtticketsisR=70t.

TheprofitisgivenbyP(t)=R(t)-C(t),whereC(t)isthecostfunctionforttickets.

Ift\leq60,thenC(t)=50t+800.Ift>60,thenC(t)=70\cdot60+(t-60)(50+70-(t-60)).

Wefindthatthebreak-evenpointist=70.Thus,ift>70,wehaveP(t)=70t-[70\cdot60+(t-60)(50+70-(t-60))].

Simplifying,weget

P(t)=-t^2+140t-4200=-(t-100)(t-40).

Hence,themaximumtwhichwillbringtheamusementparkaprofitgreaterthan\4200ist=100.

Theequationofthelinepassingthrough(x_1,y_1)and(x_2,y_2)isgivenbyy-y_1=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}(x-x_1).

IfweletA=(a,3a^2-5a-3)andB=(b,3b^2-5b-3),wehave

\begin{align*}
\frac{3b^2-5b-3}{b}-\frac{3a^2-5a-3}{a}&=0\\
\frac{3b^2-5b-3}{b}&=\frac{3a^2-5a-3}{a}\\
3a^2b-5ab^2-3ab&=3ab^2-5a^2b-3a^2b\\
6a^2b&=8ab^2\\
3a^2&=4b^2
\end{align*}

Wealsoknowthat(a+b)/2=0,sob=-a.Thisfurtherreducestheequationabovetoa^2=12.Therefore,

AB^2=(b-a)^2=4a^2=48

Hence,thesquarelengthofABis48.
