Let $p(a,b)$ denote the probability of obtaining  $a$ on the first die and $b$ on the second.  Then the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 is $$p(1,6)+p(2,5)+p(3,4)+p(4,3)+p(5,2)+p(6,1).$$Let the probability of obtaining face $F$ be $(1/6)+x$.  Then the probability of obtaining the face opposite face $F$ is $(1/6)-x$. Therefore $$\begin{aligned}{{47}\over{288}}&=
4\left({1\over6}\right)^2+2\left({1\over6}+x\right)
\left({1\over6}-x\right)\cr&=
{4\over36}+2\left({1\over36}-x^2\right)\cr&=
{1\over6}-2x^2.\end{aligned}$$Then $2x^2=1/288$, and so $x=1/24$. The probability of obtaining face $F$ is therefore $(1/6)+(1/24)=5/24$, and $m+n=\boxed{29}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Denote $F$ as the largest number on a die, then we have $P(F) > 1/6$, $P(7-F) < 1/6$ and $F >3.5$. There are $6$ possible values for the sum of two dice, and we wish to obtain $7$, so there are only two complementary possibilities: $F$ and $7-F$. We consider these two cases separately.

$F$ is on one die, and $7-F$ is on the other. The probability of this occurring is $P(F) \cdot P(7-F)$. There are two such cases (which die has $F$), and there are $5 \cdot 5 = 25$ possibilities total, so the probability of case 1 is $\frac{10}{72}$.

$F$ is on both dice. The probability of this occurring is $P(F)^2$. There is one such case, so the probability of case 2 is $\frac{1}{36}$.

The total probability is the sum of these two cases, which is $\frac{10}{72} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{8}$.

Finally, we substitute this expression for the probability back into the information we were given: $\frac{1}{8} = \frac{47}{288} \cdot 6$, which implies $P(F) = \frac{47}{288} \cdot 3$, and the answer is $47+288=\boxed{335}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Since $\frac{2005}{3} = 668\frac13$, there are 668 multiples of 3 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{4} = 501\frac14$, there are 501 multiples of 4 between 1 and 2005.  Since $\frac{2005}{12} = 167\frac{1}{12}$, there are 167 multiples of 12 between 1 and 2005.

Every multiple of 12 is also a multiple of 3 and of 4, so there are $668-167 = 501$ multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 12 and $501-167 = 334$ multiples of 4 that are not multiples of 12.  That leaves $501 + 334 = \boxed{835}$ numbers that are multiples of 3 or 4 but not 12.  (Note: no number can be a multiple of 3 and 4 without also being a multiple of 12.  So, no number is included twice in our count $501+334$.)

Extracting Answer from: 
We want to count the numbers in the set $S = \{1,2,\ldots,2005\}$ that are divisible by 3 or 4, but not by 12. We can do that by taking the total number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by 3 or 4 (inclusive), and subtracting the number of integers that are divisible by 12.

The number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by 3 is $\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{3} \right\rfloor = 668$. Similarly, the number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by 4 is $\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{4} \right\rfloor = 501$. However, some numbers are counted twice, because they are multiples of both 3 and 4. The number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by both 3 and 4, i.e., by 12, is $\left\lfloor \frac{2005}{12} \right\rfloor = 167$. Therefore, the total number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by 3 or 4 is $668 + 501 - 167 = 1002$.

However, we have subtracted the integers that are divisible by 12, so we need to add them back. The number of integers between 1 and 2005 that are divisible by 12 is 167, so the final answer is $1002 + 167 = \boxed{1169}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 36 possible outcomes for the two dice. Of these, there is 1 where both dice roll a six, 5 where the first die rolls a six and the other rolls something less than a six, and 5 more where the second die rolls a six and the first die rolls something less than a six. So, there are a total of $1+5+5=11$ ways the larger number rolled can be a six. Similarly, there are $1+4+4=9$ ways the larger number rolled can be a five, $1+3+3=7$ ways the larger number rolled can be a four, $1+2+2=5$ ways the larger number rolled can be a three, $1+1+1=3$ ways the larger number rolled can be a two, and $1$ way the larger number rolled can be a one. The expected value of the larger number is \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{36}(11(6)+9(5)&+7(4)+5(3)+3(2)+1(1))\\

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/counting_and_probability/answers/1044_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are $6^2=36$ possible outcomes.  Of these, there are six outcomes for which both dice show the same number; in each such outcome, the larger value is that number.  For each of the other 30 outcomes, there are two possibilities: the smaller number is larger, or the larger number is larger.  Thus, there are a total of $6+30\cdot \frac{1}{2}=21$ outcomes for which the larger number is uniquely determined.\par

In order to evaluate the expected value of the larger of the two rolls, it's expedient to consider all 36 outcomes one at a time.  We list all 36 possible outcomes and their probabilities in the table below.

\[
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{array}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c||c}
\text{First die} & \multicolumn{6}{c||}{\text{Second die}} & \\
\text{roll} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & \text{Probability} \\ \hline\hline
1   & (1,1) & (1,2) & (1,3) & (1,4) & (1,5) & (1,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline
2   & (2,1) & (2,2) & (2,3) & (2,4) & (2,5) & (2,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline
3   & (3,1) & (3,2) & (3,3) & (3,4) & (3,5) & (3,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline
4   & (4,1) & (4,2) & (4,3) & (4,4) & (4,5) & (4,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline
5   & (5,1) & (5,2) & (5,3) & (5,4) & (5,5) & (5,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline
6   & (6,1) & (6,2) & (6,3) & (6,4) & (6,5) & (6,6) & 1/36 \\ \hline\hline
    & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 1
\end{array}
\]If we therefore let $X$ be the larger of the two dice, then \begin{align*}
E(X) &= \frac{6}{36} \cdot 1 + \frac{5}{36} \cdot 2 + \frac{4}{36} \cdot 3 + \frac{3}{36} \cdot 4 + \frac{2}{36} \cdot 5 + \frac{1}{36} \cdot 6 \\
&= \frac{43}{36} = \boxed{\frac{43}{36}}.

The sum of the three integers on the drawn balls is 15 minus the sum of the integers on the two balls that were left behind.  Therefore, we are looking for the probability that the two balls that were left behind sum to an even number.  There are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose these two balls.  Their sum is even only if they are both even or both odd.  The probability they are both even is $\frac{1}{10}$ and the probability that they are both odd is $\frac{3}{10}$.  In total, the probability that their sum is even is $\frac{1}{10}+\frac{3}{10}=\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$.

There are two ways to count in this problem: either list the sum of all equally likely possibilities (conditioned on the first two draws) and count the odd sums, or list the odd sums and count the possibilities that give rise to each sum.  We undertake the latter.
\[ \begin{array}{ccccccc} &\multicolumn{6}{c}{\text{Second ball value}}\\ &&1&&2&&3\\ \multirow{6}{*}{\begin{sideways}\text{Third ball value}\end{sideways}}&1&&&\\ &2&&1&3\\ &3&&&\\ &4&&1&3\\ &5&&&\\ \end{array} \]The odd numbers that can be obtained are 1, 3, 5, 7.  
1 can be obtained by selecting (1,2,4), (1,3,5), (1,4,5), which have 3 different permutations each, making 9 possible permutations.
5 can be obtained by selecting (1,2,5), (1,3,4), (2,3,5), (2,4,5), which have 3, 6, 3, 3 permutations respectively, making 15 total permutations.
The other odd sums, 3 and 7, can easily be seen to have no solutions, so our total is 24, out of $\binom{5}{3}=10$ total possibilities, for a probability of $\boxed{\frac{12}{25}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the first book on the shelf is a math book.  There are three possibilities for the second book: it could be a history book, a physics book, or another math book.  

Case 1: The second book is a history book
In this case, there are two possibilities for the third book (a physics book or another math book).  After that, the pattern repeats: if the fourth book is a math book, then the fifth must be a history book, and vice versa.  We can visualize this as follows, where M denotes a math book, H denotes a history book, and P denotes a physics book:
```
M H P M H P M H
```
There are two possible ways to fill in the last two slots (with a physics book or with another math book).  Therefore, there are $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ arrangements of books that start with a math book and have a history book as the second book.

Case 2: The second book is a physics book
This is identical to Case 1, but with "history book" and "math book" swapped.  Therefore, there are an additional 4 arrangements that start with a math book and have a physics book as the second book.

Case 3: The second book is another math book
In this case, the third book must be a history book.  After that, the pattern repeats with math and physics books.  Again, there are two possible choices for the last two books.  Therefore, there are an additional 4 arrangements that start with a math book and have another math book as the second book.

Putting it all together, there are a total of $4 + 4 + 4 = \boxed{12}$ arrangements.

We then count the odd terms of the sequence. Subtract $3$ from the list to get $4,$ $8,$ $12,$ $\ldots,$ $92,$ then divide by $4$ to get $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $\ldots,$ $23.$ So this list has ${23}$ numbers.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can count the numbers in the list by counting the first and last terms, and then figuring out how many numbers are between them. 

The first term is 6. The last term is 98. The list goes up by 1 each time, so the next term after 6 is 7, the next after that is 8, and so on, until we get to 98. 

So the list includes every number from 6 to 98, inclusive. To count how many numbers are in this list, we can subtract the first number from the last number and then add 1 (to include both endpoints). That gives us:

$$
98 - 6 + 1 = 93 + 1 = \boxed{94}.
$$

The only way in which there won't be two dice displaying the same number is if exactly one number between 1 and 6 isn't being displayed on any of the dice and the 5 dice all display different numbers. There are 6 different possibilities for the number that isn't being displayed, and then there are a total of $5!$ ways in which the 5 dice displaying different numbers can be arranged, so there are a total of $6\cdot5!$ outcomes that result in the dice all displaying different numbers. Since each of the 5 dice can have 6 results when rolled and all of the rolls are determined independently, there are a total of $6^5$ possible outcomes, which means that the probability of all of the dice showing different numbers is $\dfrac{6\cdot5!}{6^5}=\dfrac{5}{54}$, so the probability that we want is $1-\dfrac{5}{54}=\boxed{\dfrac{49}{54}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
To calculate this probability, it's easier to calculate the probability that no two dice show the same number (i.e., all five dice have different numbers) and then subtract from 1.

The first die can show any of the six possible numbers. For the second die, there are only five remaining numbers that won't match the first die, so the probability of getting a different number is 5/6. Similarly, the third die has a 4/6 probability of showing a different number from the first two, the fourth die has a 3/6 probability of showing a different number from the first three, and the fifth die has a 2/6 probability of showing a different number from the first four. Therefore, the probability that all five dice show different numbers is:

6/6 × 5/6 × 4/6 × 3/6 × 2/6 = 5/54

So the probability that at least two dice show the same number is:

1 - 5/54 = 49/54

Therefore, the probability is 49/54.

We will use the Binomial Theorem to expand the given expression. Let $a = 10x^3$ and $b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}$. Then we have

$$(a + b)^5 = \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} a^{5-k} b^k$$

Recall that $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Using this formula, we can find the coefficient of the term involving only $a^{5-k} b^k$, which corresponds to the constant term of the expansion. For this term, we must have $5-k = k$, which means $k = 2$. Therefore, we have

$$\binom{5}{2} a^{3} b^2 = 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = \boxed{\frac{25}{2}}$$

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 6 letters in the word ELEVEN.

If all the letters were unique, without any repeat letters, then the number of arrangements would be 6! (6 factorial) which is 720.

However, in this case, there are two E's, two L's, and two N's, so some of the arrangements will be identical.

To account for this, we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways the repeated letters can be arranged. For example, there are 2! (2 factorial) ways to arrange the two E's, 2! ways to arrange the two L's, and 2! ways to arrange the two N's.

Thus, the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in ELEVEN is:

6! / (2! x 2! x 2!) = 720 / 8 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 possible ways to arrange the letters in the word ELEVEN.

Consider the $n\times 3$ grid with $n$ vertical lines each of $3$ dots. There are $\binom{n}{2}$ horizontal lines, and for each horizontal line there are $\binom{4}{2}$ squares of size $1$, $\binom{5}{2}$ squares of size $2$, and $\binom{6}{2}$ squares of size $3$. Thus the total number of squares is
\[{n\choose 2}\left({4\choose 2}+{5\choose 2}+{6\choose 2}\right) = {n\choose 2}(22+30+50) = 102{n\choose 2}.\]Thus $n$ must be such that $102{n\choose 2} = 70$. Since $\binom{10}{2} = 45$ and $\binom{11}{2} = 55$, we know that $n$ must be between $10$ and $11$ (inclusive). Also, $102\cdot 10\cdot 11 = 11,\!220$, which is too large, so $n=\boxed{10}$.

To have three distinct elements, two of $n-2$, $n+2$, $2n$, and $\frac{n}{2}$ must be equal. It is clear that $n-2$ can never equal $n+2$. However, any other equality pairing among the four is possible, so we simply check for distinctness. If $2n = \frac{n}{2}$, the solution is $n= 0$. If $n+ 2 = 2n$, $n = 2$. If $n - 2 = 2n$, $n = -2$. If $\frac{n}{2} = n - 2$, $n = 4$. Finally, if $\frac{n}{2} = n+ 2$, $n = -4$. Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ such $n$.

Let $*(n) = \{a,b,c,d\}$, where $a\leq b\leq c\leq d$. Since $a,b,c,d$ are distinct, we must have $d>b>a$ and $d>c>a$. The first of these inequalities is equivalent to $d-b>0$ and the second is equivalent to $d-c>0$. Therefore, $b<c<d$ and $c<a<d$. Thus, $d$ must be the maximum element of $*(n)$, $a$ must be the minimum element of $*(n)$, and exactly one of $b$ and $c$ must lie strictly between $a$ and $d$. We consider a few cases.

If $a = n-2$ is odd, then we must have $b=c=n$ and $d=n+2$. This gives one solution, namely $n=3$.
If $a = n-2$ is even, then $*(n)$ contains at least two even numbers. If $a = n-2$ is a multiple of $4$, then exactly one of $b$ and $c$ is a multiple of $4$. If $a$ is not a multiple of $4$, then both $b$ and $c$ must be multiples of $4$. We consider sub-cases:

If $a=n-2$ is not a multiple of $4$, then $b=c=2n$ and $d=n+2$, so there is one solution $n=2$. 
If $a = n-2$ is a multiple of $4$ and $b$ is odd, then $c=2n$ and $d=n+2$, leading to the solution $n=10$.
If $a = n-2$ is a multiple of $4$ and $c$ is odd, then $b=2n$ and $d=n+2$, which has no solutions.


Thus, the solutions are $n=\boxed{2,3,10}$.

To begin, consider the number of ways to arrange the three countries around the circle.  We can consider the English representatives a block, the Germans another block, and the French a third block.  There are $(3-1)!=2$ ways to arrange these three blocks around a circle.  We can also see this by simply drawing the two possible arrangements: [asy]

label("F",(-.75,-1));
label("G",(.75,-1));

[/asy] Within the English group, there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the three representatives.  Similarly, there are $4!$ ways to arrange the Germans and $2!$ ways to arrange the French representatives.

Treating the representatives of each country as a single entity (so there are three entities total), there are $3!=6$ distinct ways for the entities to sit.  Within each entity, the representatives can sit in $n!$ ways, where $n$ is the number of representatives of that country.  Therefore, representatives from England can sit in $3!$ ways, those from Germany in $4!$ ways, and those from France in $2!$ ways.  Thus our answer is $6 \cdot 3! \cdot 4! \cdot 2! = 17,\!280$.  Note that since there is a fixed orientation of the table, we need to divide by 9 to account for rotations, but since 9 is relatively prime to 17,280, this is not a problem: our final answer is $\dfrac{17,\!280}{9} = \boxed{1920}$.

Instead of directly finding the probability that at least two faces match, we can find the probability that no faces match and then subtract the result from 1. The results on the three dice are independent of each other, so we compute the probability for each die and then multiply the probabilities. The first die does not have to be a particular number. There are 6 possible numbers, but any number will work, so the probability is $\frac{6}{6}=1$. In order for the second die to have a different number from the first, there are 5 other numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{5}{6}$. For the third die to have a different number from the first and second, there are 4 other numbers out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that no faces match is $1\times\frac{5}{6}\times\frac{2}{3}=\frac{5}{9}$. That means the probability that at least two faces match is $1-\frac{5}{9}=\boxed{\frac{4}{9}}$.

There are $6^3=216$ equally likely outcomes when we roll three dice. If exactly three of the faces match, there are 6 ways to choose the face that comes up all three times, and 5 ways to choose the value of the other face. So there are $6\cdot 5=30$ outcomes in which exactly three faces match. If exactly two of the faces match, there are $\binom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose the dice that will match, $\binom{6}{2}=15$ ways to choose the pair of faces that come up, and $4$ choices for each of the dice that does not match, giving a total of $3\cdot 15\cdot 4^1$ outcomes. Since no more than two of the faces can match, the probability that at least two of the faces match is $\dfrac{\text{successful outcomes}}{\text{total outcomes}}$, or $\dfrac{30+180}{216}=\dfrac{210}{216}=\boxed{\dfrac{35}{36}}$.

A: There are several different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is:

- Fix one person at a vertex of the square table.
- Then there are 7 people left to be seated in 3 pairs and one individual.
- Arrange the pairs first: there are 3 pairs, so there are 3! = 6 ways to order them.
- Then the remaining individual can be seated opposite to the fixed person or next to them on either side, which gives 3 possibilities.
- However, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotations of the table, since each configuration can be rotated in 4 ways and still be considered equivalent.
- Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is (6 x 3) / 4 = 4.5, but since the number of arrangements must be an integer, we round up to get the final answer of 5.

Therefore, there are 5 ways to seat 8 people around a square table with 2 people on a side, up to rotations.

Extracting Answer from: 
Let L be the number of losses and W be the number of wins. We are given that L/W = 7/13. Solving for L, we get L = 7W/13. 

The probability of winning the next game can be expressed as the ratio of the number of ways to win the next game to the total number of outcomes. 

Since ties are not permitted, there are two possible outcomes for each game: win or lose. Therefore, the total number of outcomes is 2. 

If the team wins the next game, then the new ratio of losses to wins will be (L + 0)/(W + 1) = L/(W+1+7/13). We can simplify this as L/(20W/13 + 1), or L/(20W+13). 

If the team loses the next game, then the new ratio of losses to wins will be (L + 1)/(W + 1) = (7W/13 + 1)/(W+1). We can simplify this as (7W+13)/(13W+13).

Therefore, the probability of winning the next game is:

P(win) = W/(W+L) * [1/(20W+13) + 0.5/(W+1)] = W/[W+(7/13)W]*[1/(20W+13) + 0.5/(W+1)]
       = 13/20 * [1/(20W+13) + 0.5/(W+1)]

To express this percentage, we can compute the value of W that maximizes this expression and plug it in. Taking the derivative with respect to W, we get:

dP(win)/dW = 13/20 * [-1/(20W+13)^2 + 0.5/(W+1)^2]
Setting this equal to 0 and solving for W, we obtain:

-1/(20W+13)^2 + 0.5/(W+1)^2 = 0
1/(20W+13)^2 = 0.5/(W+1)^2
W = 13/3

Plugging this value of W into the expression for P(win), we get:

P(win) = 13/20 * [1/(20*13/3 + 13) + 0.5/(13/3+1)] = 58.44%

Extracting Answer from: 
If we have two circles, the maximum number of points of intersection is 2, if they intersect at two distinct points. Similarly, the maximum number of points of intersection between three circles is 6 if every pair of circles intersect at two distinct points.

Now, when we add the fourth circle, it can intersect each of the previous three circles in at most two points. However, each pair of circles already has two points of intersection. Therefore, the fourth circle can add at most two new points to each pair of circles, for a total of 2 x 3 = 6 new points.

So the maximum number of points where at least two of the circles intersect is 2 + 6 = 8.

Extracting Answer from: 
A: There are 5 options for the first key. After that, there are only 4 options left for the second key, because it can't be the same as the first. Similarly, the third key has 3 options, the fourth key has 2 options, and the fifth key has only 1 option. So the total number of ways to arrange the keys is:

5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

However, we are told that two arrangements are considered the same if one can be rotated or flipped to be identical to the other. So we need to divide by the number of ways each arrangement can be rotated or flipped to get an equivalent arrangement.

Each arrangement can be rotated in 4 different orientations (the first key can be in any of the 5 positions, and then the remaining keys can be arranged in any order), and it can also be flipped over (which gives a total of 8 equivalent arrangements). So we divide the total number of arrangements by 8 to get the number of distinct arrangements:

120 / 8 = 15

So there are 15 distinct ways to arrange the 5 keys on the keychain.

There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to use a probability table. We can list all the possible outcomes of rolling the two dice and adding their faces, and group them by whether the sum is odd or even:

| 3     | 6     | 9   | Odd      |

There are 18 possible outcomes, and 9 of them have an odd sum. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd sum is 9/18 = 1/2, or 50%. Another way to see this is to notice that in each pair of rows, the sum is the same but the odd/even status is different, so they cancel out. Therefore, we only need to count how many outcomes have an odd sum, which is 9.

The number of ways to roll exactly 2 6's is $\binom{5}{2}5^3$, since there are $\binom{5}{2}$ choices for which of the two dice are 6, and there are 5 choices for each of the other 3 dice. Similarly, the number of ways to roll exactly 1 6 is $\binom{5}{1}5^4$, and the number of ways to roll no 6's is $\binom{5}{0}5^5$. So the probability is \[\frac{\binom{5}{2}5^3+\binom{5}{1}5^4+\binom{5}{0}5^5}{6^5}=\boxed{\frac{625}{648}}.\]

Extracting Answer from: 
We will use the complementary probability -- that is, we will find the probability that we get a 6 in 3, 4, or 5 of the rolls, and then subtract from 1. 

The probability of getting a 6 on any given roll is 1/6. The probability of not getting a 6 on any given roll is 5/6.

To get a 6 in exactly 3 of the 5 rolls, we need to choose 3 of the rolls to be 6's, and the other 2 rolls to not be 6's. The probability of this happening is:

${5 \choose 3}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{6^3} \cdot \frac{25}{6^2} = \frac{1250}{6^5}$

To get a 6 in exactly 4 of the 5 rolls, we need to choose 4 of the rolls to be 6's, and the other 1 roll to not be a 6. The probability of this happening is:

${5 \choose 4}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^4 \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^1 = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{6^4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} = \frac{625}{6^5}$

To get a 6 in all 5 rolls, the probability is:

$\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{6^5}$

So, the probability of getting a 6 in 3, 4, or 5 of the rolls is:

$\frac{1250}{6^5} + \frac{625}{6^5} + \frac{1}{6^5} = \frac{1876}{6^5}$

The probability of not getting a 6 in 3, 4, or 5 of the rolls is therefore:

$1 - \frac{1876}{6^5} = \frac{6^5 - 1876}{6^5}$

So the probability of getting a 6 in at most 2 of the rolls is:

$\frac{6^5 - 1876}{6^5} = \boxed{\frac{55950}{7776}}$

To find the coefficient of $x^2y^2$, we can find the coefficient in each of the 4th powers. These are the only things that can contribute $x^2y^2$ terms to the final expansion.

The expansion of $(x+y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$, by the Binomial Theorem.

The expansion of $(x+2y)^4$ will have a coefficient of $2^2\binom{4}{2}$ for $x^2y^2$.

Thus the coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4$ will be $\binom{4}{2}+4\binom{4}{2}=\boxed{30}$.

We can start by expanding both terms using the binomial theorem:
\begin{align*}
(x+y)^4 &= \binom{4}{0} x^4 y^0 + \binom{4}{1} x^3 y^1 + \binom{4}{2} x^2 y^2+\binom{4}{3}x^1y^3+\binom{4}{4}x^0y^4 \\
&= x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4 \\
(x+2y)^4 &= \binom{4}{0} x^4 (2y)^0 + \binom{4}{1} x^3 (2y)^1 + \binom{4}{2} x^2 (2y)^2+\\
&\hspace{2cm} \binom{4}{3}x^1(2y)^3+\binom{4}{4}x^0(2y)^4 \\
&= x^4 + 8x^3y + 24x^2y^2 + 32xy^3 + 16y^4
\end{align*}
Adding the two expressions gives $(x+y)^4+(x+2y)^4 = 2x^4+12x^3y+30x^2y^2+36xy^3+17y^4$. The coefficient of $x^2y^2$ in this expression is $\boxed{30}$.

There are 60 distinct ways to arrange 5 beads on a bracelet, but many of them are equivalent under rotations and flips. For any arrangement of beads on the bracelet, there are 5 possible places we can start reading the arrangement (one for each bead), and for each starting point there are two possible directions to read the arrangement (clockwise or counterclockwise). Therefore, each distinct arrangement of beads corresponds to 10 different arrangements that are equivalent under rotations and flips.

Thus, the number of distinct arrangements of 5 beads on a bracelet, up to rotations and flips, is 60/10 = 6.

Extracting Answer from: 
We know that the only way to obtain a product that is divisible by 6 is if the die roll includes at least one factor of 2 and at least one factor of 3. Therefore, we are looking for die rolls that include either a 2 or a 4, and either a 3 or a 6. 

There are four possible ways to roll a 2 or a 4: 

- Roll a 1, 2, or 3 on the bottom and a 2 or 4 on top (2 ways to do this)
- Roll a 5 or 6 on the bottom and a 2 on top (2 ways to do this)

There are two possible ways to roll a 3 or a 6: 

- Roll a 1, 2, or 3 on the bottom and a 3 or 6 on top (2 ways to do this)

Therefore, there are a total of $4 \times 2 = 8$ ways to obtain a product that is divisible by 6. 

Since each of the six possible bottom faces is equally likely, and we know that we need one of two possible top faces to get a "successful" roll, the probability of success on any given roll is $\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$. 

Therefore, the probability of obtaining a product that is divisible by 6 is:

$$ P(\text{divisible by 6}) = \frac{1}{3} \times 8 = \frac{8}{3} \approx \boxed{0.267} $$

(Note that this answer is greater than 1 because probabilities cannot be greater than 1. This is because we counted all the ways to obtain a successful roll, but not all rolls are successful.)

The non-prime numbers less than or equal to 6 are 1, 4, and 6.  There are 3 ways to roll a 1 or a 4 and 5 ways to roll a 6.  So Adam can roll a non-prime on one die in $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ ways and on the second die in 3 ways.  There are $6\cdot6=36$ ways to roll two dice, so the probability that he rolls at least one non-prime number is $6/36=1/6$.  Therefore, the probability that he gets two primes is $1-\frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$.  Our final answer is thus $\boxed{\frac{25}{36}}$.

Since the sum of all these probabilities must be 1, we have that $x + 2x + \cdots + 6x = 1$, which means that $21x = 1$, so $x = \frac{1}{21}$.  Therefore \[ E = \frac{1}{21}(1) + \frac{2}{21}(2) + \cdots + \frac{6}{21}(6) = \frac{1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots 6^2}{21} = \boxed{\frac{13}{3}}. \]

Hence the expected value of a roll is $$E = 1\cdot\frac{1}{20} + 2\cdot\frac{2}{20} + 3\cdot\frac{3}{20} + 4\cdot\frac{4}{20} + 5\cdot\frac{5}{20} + 6\cdot\frac{6}{20} = \boxed{\frac{91}{20}}.$$

A: Steve has 25 cents, 10 cents (5+5), and 3 cents, so he has a total of 38 cents. 

To find out how many different-priced items he could pay for with exact change, we need to look for numbers that divide evenly into 38. 

38 has factors of 1, 2, 19, and 38, so he could pay for exact change for items that cost: 

- 1 cent 
- 2 cents 
- 19 cents 
- 38 cents 

So, he could pay for four different-priced items with the exact change he has.

We can solve the problem using complementary counting. The only possible outcomes where the number of heads from flipping the two coins is the same are (HHH, TTT) and (HHT, TTH, HTT, THT), where H represents a head and T represents a tail. The probability of getting the first outcome is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{64}$, and the probability of getting the second outcome is $\binom{4}{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4\cdot\binom{3}{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{3}{16}$. So the probability of getting the same number of heads is $1-\left(\frac{1}{64}+\frac{3}{16}\right) = \boxed{\frac{49}{64}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 11 letters in the word MISSISSIPPI.

First, we can start by considering the number of arrangements if all 11 letters were distinct. This would be 11! (11 factorial), or 39,916,800.

However, in the word MISSISSIPPI, there are repeated letters. Specifically, there are:

- 4 S's
- 4 I's
- 2 P's
- 1 M

When we arrange the letters, we need to take into account that we are overcounting some arrangements because the repeated letters can be interchanged without giving a new arrangement. To correct for this overcounting, we can divide by the factorials of the number of repeated letters.

Specifically, there are 4! ways to interchange the S's, 4! ways to interchange the I's, and 2! ways to interchange the P's. We don't need to worry about the M, because there is only one of them. So, the total number of distinct arrangements is:

11! / (4! * 4! * 2!) = 34,650. 

So there are 34,650 ways to arrange the letters of the word MISSISSIPPI.

Extracting Answer from: 
We solve the problem by finding the probability that the product of the two dice is less than or equal to the sum of the two dice. Call this probability $p$. Notice that $(1,1)$ is the only pair of numbers for which the product is less than or equal to the sum, so we have the following cases:

Case 1: The sum is 2. The only possibility is $(1,1)$, which occurs with probability $\frac{1}{64}$.

Case 2: The sum is 3. The possible pairs are $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$, each of which occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$. In both cases, the product is less than or equal to the sum.

Case 3: The sum is 4. The possible pairs are $(1,3)$, $(3,1)$, $(2,2)$. Each pair occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, and $(2,2)$ has a product equal to its sum, so we are left with two pairs whose product is less than their sum, and each of these occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$.

Case 4: The sum is 5. The possible paris are $(1,4)$, $(4,1)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,2)$. Again, each pair occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, and none of the pairs have a product less than their sum.

Case 5: The sum is 6. The possible pairs are $(1,5)$, $(5,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(4,2)$, $(3,3)$. The first and second pairs each occur with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, and the third and fourth pairs each occur with probability $\frac{4}{64}$, for a total of $\frac{12}{64}$. Only the pair $(2,4)$ has a product less than its sum.

Case 6: The sum is 7. The possible pairs are $(1,6)$, $(6,1)$,$(2,5)$, $(5,2)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$. The first pair occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, the second and third pairs each occur with probability $\frac{4}{64}$, and the fourth and fifth pairs each occur with probability $\frac{6}{64}$, for a total of $\frac{22}{64}$. Only the pair $(2,5)$ has a product less than its sum.

Case 7: The sum is 8. The possible pairs are $(1,7)$, $(7,1)$, $(2,6)$, $(6,2)$, $(3,5)$, $(5,3)$, $(4,4)$. The first pair occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, the second and third pairs each occur with probability $\frac{6}{64}$, the fourth and fifth pairs each occur with probability $\frac{8}{64}$, and the last pair occurs with probability $\frac{5}{64}$, for a total of $\frac{35}{64}$. Only the pairs $(2,6)$ and $(3,5)$ have a product less than their sum.

Case 8: The sum is 9. The possible pairs are $(1,8)$, $(8,1)$, $(2,7)$, $(7,2)$, $(3,6)$, $(6,3)$, $(4,5)$, $(5,4)$. The first pair occurs with probability $\frac{2}{64}$, the second and third pairs each occur with probability $\frac{8}{64}$, the fourth and fifth pairs each occur with probability $\frac{10}{64}$, and the last two pairs each occur with probability $\frac{12}{64}$, for a total of $\frac{52}{64}$. None of these pairs have a product less than their sum.

Therefore, the probability that the product of the two dice is greater than their sum is $1-p = 1-\frac{2+4+2+1+1}{64}=\frac{54}{64}=\boxed{\frac{27}{32}}$.

A: There are 36 rectangles in the array. 

To see why, we can count the number of ways we can choose two horizontal lines and two vertical lines to form a rectangle. 

There are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the horizontal lines and $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose the vertical lines. This gives us a total of $6 \times 6 = 36$ rectangles.

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/counting_and_probability/answers/64_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are 8 possible outcomes for each of the two dice, so there are a total of 8 x 8 = 64 possible outcomes for the sum of the rolls.

To calculate the expected value, we need to multiply each possible outcome by its probability and then sum up the results.

The probability of rolling any given sum is equal to the number of ways that sum can be achieved divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

Here are the possible sums and their corresponding probabilities:

- Sum of 2: there is only one way to roll a 2, by getting two 1s. The probability of this is 1/64.
- Sum of 3: there are two ways to roll a 3, by getting either a 1 and a 2 or a 2 and a 1. The probability of this is 2/64 = 1/32.
- Sum of 4: there are three ways to roll a 4, by getting either a 1 and a 3, a 2 and a 2, or a 3 and a 1. The probability of this is 3/64.
- Sum of 5: there are four ways to roll a 5, by getting a 1 and a 4, a 2 and a 3, a 3 and a 2, or a 4 and a 1. The probability of this is 4/64 = 1/16.
- Sum of 6: there are five ways to roll a 6, by getting a 1 and a 5, a 2 and a 4, a 3 and a 3, a 4 and a 2, or a 5 and a 1. The probability of this is 5/64.
- Sum of 7: there are six ways to roll a 7, by getting any of the following pairs: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, 4 and 3, 5 and 2, or 6 and 1. The probability of this is 6/64 = 3/32.
- Sum of 8: there are five ways to roll an 8, by getting any of the following pairs: 2 and 6, 3 and 5, 4 and 4, 5 and 3, or 6 and 2. The probability of this is 5/64.
- Sum of 9: there are four ways to roll a 9, by getting any of the following pairs: 3 and 6, 4 and 5, 5 and 4, or 6 and 3. The probability of this is 4/64 = 1/16.
- Sum of 10: there are three ways to roll a 10, by getting any of the following pairs: 4 and 6, 5 and 5, or 6 and 4. The probability of this is 3/64.
- Sum of 11: there are two ways to roll an 11, by getting either a 5 and a 6 or a 6 and a 5. The probability of this is 2/64 = 1/32.
- Sum of 12: there is only one way to roll a 12, by getting two 8s. The probability of this is 1/64.

Now we can calculate the expected value:

E(X) = 2 x (1/64) + 3 x (1/32) + 4 x (3/64) + 5 x (1/16) + 6 x (5/64) + 7 x (3/32) + 8 x (5/64) + 9 x (1/16) + 10 x (3/64) + 11 x (1/32) + 12 x (1/64)

E(X) = 5.5

Therefore, the expected value of the sum of the rolls is 5.5.

The distances between corners of a unit cube are 1, $\sqrt{2}$, and $\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and 1, the third side has to be $\sqrt{2}$. If the two shortest sides are 1 and $\sqrt{2}$, the third side must be $\sqrt{3}$. If the two shortest sides are $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{2}$, the third side must also be $\sqrt{2}$. There is no case where the shortest side is $\sqrt{3}$. This gives $\boxed{3}$ non-congruent triangles.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are two cases to consider: triangles whose vertices lie on three adjacent corners of the cube, and triangles whose vertices do not lie on three adjacent corners.

For the first case, there are 8 choices for the first vertex, 3 choices for the second vertex (it cannot lie on a face adjacent to the first vertex), and 2 choices for the third vertex (it must lie on the only remaining corner). However, this counts each triangle 3 times (once for each vertex), so we must divide by 3. Thus, there are (8 x 3 x 2)/3 = 16 non-congruent triangles in this case.

For the second case, any such triangle must have two vertices that are diagonally opposite each other on the cube, and a third vertex that lies on one of the four faces not containing those two vertices. There are 12 choices for the pair of diagonal vertices, and 4 choices for the third vertex. However, this counts each triangle twice (once for each choice of diagonal vertices), so we must divide by 2. Thus, there are (12 x 4)/2 = 24 non-congruent triangles in this case.

In total, there are 16 + 24 = 40 non-congruent triangles that can be drawn with vertices on the corners of a unit cube.

This problem can be solved using stars and bars. Imagine that we have 5 stars (representing the balls) and we need to split them up into 2 groups (representing the boxes). We can do this by placing a divider (representing the division between the two boxes) in one of 4 spaces between the stars. For example, if we place the divider between the 2nd and 3rd stars, we have:

**|***

This represents 2 balls in one box and 3 in the other. There are 4 spaces between the stars where we could place the divider, so there are 4 ways to divide the balls into 2 boxes. Therefore, there are 4 ways to do this.

Extracting Answer from: 
We proceed by finding the probability that the product will be negative and subtracting that from 1. If $a\cdot b$ is negative, then either $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, or $a$ is positive and $b$ is negative. We will split this into two cases, one where $-3\leq a\leq 0$ and $-2\leq b\leq 0$, and the other where $0\leq a\leq 1$ and $0\leq b\leq 4$.

Case 1: $-3\leq a\leq 0$ and $-2\leq b\leq 0$

From the given conditions we see that the possible values of $a$ form an interval of length 3, and the possible values of $b$ form an interval of length 2. Thus, the area of the rectangle that this region forms is $3\cdot 2 = 6$.

Since we need $a$ to be negative and $b$ to be positive, we will reflect this region about the $x$-axis. Thus, we want the area of the region of the parallelogram with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, $(-3,2)$, and $(-3,0)$, which is a rectangle with dimensions $3$ by $2$. So, the probability that $a\cdot b$ is negative in this region is $\frac{3\cdot 2}{4\cdot 5}=\frac{3}{10}$.

Case 2: $0\leq a\leq 1$ and $0\leq b\leq 4$

The possible values of $a$ form an interval of length 1, and the possible values of $b$ form an interval of length 6. Thus, the area of the rectangle that this region forms is $1\cdot 6 = 6$.

Since we need $a$ to be positive and $b$ to be negative, we will reflect this region about the $y$-axis. Thus, we want the area of the region of the parallelogram with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,-4)$, $(1,-4)$, and $(0,1)$, which has area $\frac 12\cdot 4\cdot 1 + \frac 12\cdot 1\cdot 4 = 4$. So, the probability that $a\cdot b$ is negative in this region is $\frac{4}{6\cdot 5}=\frac{2}{15}$.

Therefore, the probability that $a\cdot b$ is positive is $1-\frac{3}{10}-\frac{2}{15} = \boxed{\frac{13}{30}}$.

Consider the decimal part separately, so we're trying to find the greatest integer less than $(10+0.3)^3$. By the Binomial Theorem in the above expansion, this is equal to  \[10^3+3(10^2)(.3)+3(10)(.3^2)+.3^3\] Expanding these terms, we have that $(10.3)^3=1000+90+2.7+.027$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We calculate the probability that he does not draw a card from at least three of the suits. To do this, we calculate the number of sets of 5 cards from at most two suits and divide by $\binom{52}5$, the number of sets of 5 cards. Since there are $\binom42=6$ choices for the two suits, and $\binom{26}5$ ways to choose 5 cards from the 26 in those two suits, our answer would appear to be $6\binom{26}5$. But this triple-counts the ways to choose the cards from a single suit: 5 hearts is included in 5 (hearts and spades), 5 (hearts and clubs), and 5 (hearts and diamonds). So we subtract twice the number of ways to choose cards from a single suit: $6\binom{26}5-2\cdot4\binom{13}5$. We divide this by $\binom{52}5$ to get $$\frac{6\cdot26\cdot25\cdot24\cdot23\cdot22-8\cdot13\cdot12\cdot11\cdot10\cdot9}{52\cdot51\cdot50\cdot49\cdot48}=\frac{88}{595}.$$Therefore, the probability that he draws three or four of the suits is $1-\frac{88}{595}=\boxed{\frac{507}{595}}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are $\binom{52}{5}$ ways for Mike to draw 5 cards.  There are $\binom{13}{5}$ ways for him to draw all 5 cards from one suit, $4\binom{13}{4}\binom{39}{1}$ ways for him to draw 4 cards from one suit and 1 card from a different suit, $6\binom{13}{3}\binom{13}{2}\binom{26}{1}$ ways to draw 3 cards from one suit, 2 cards from a second suit, and 1 card from a third suit, and $4\binom{13}{2}\binom{13}{2}\binom{26}{1}\binom{26}{1}$ ways to draw 2 cards from two suits, and 1 card each from the other two suits.

Therefore, the probability that he does NOT draw cards from at least three of the suits is:

$$\frac{\binom{13}{5} + 4\binom{13}{4}\binom{39}{1} + 6\binom{13}{3}\binom{13}{2}\binom{26}{1} + 4\binom{13}{2}\binom{13}{2}\binom{26}{1}\binom{26}{1}}{\binom{52}{5}} \approx 0.4614.$$

There are 5 white balls and $5+k$ total balls, so the probability that a white ball is drawn is $\dfrac{5}{5+k}$.  Similarly, the probability that a black ball is drawn is $\dfrac{k}{5+k}$.  So  \[ E = \frac{5}{5+k}(1) + \frac{k}{5+k}(-1) = -\frac{1}{2}. \] Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(5+k)$ to get $10 - 2k = -5 -k$, and we see that $\boxed{k = 15}$.

There are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but we can start with the definition of expected value.  Let $X$ be the random variable representing the amount of money the player wins or loses, with $X=1$ if a white ball is drawn and $X=-1$ if a black ball is drawn.  Then the expected value of $X$ is
\[E(X) = 1 \cdot P(\text{white ball}) + (-1) \cdot P(\text{black ball}) = P(\text{white ball}) - P(\text{black ball}).\]We want the expected loss to be 50 cents, or $E(X) = -0.5$.  Substituting in the above expression, we get
\[-0.5 = P(\text{white ball}) - P(\text{black ball}).\]Since the total number of balls in the bin is $5+k$, we have
\[P(\text{white ball}) = \frac{5}{5+k}.\]To find $P(\text{black ball})$, we can use the fact that the probabilities of all the possible outcomes must add up to 1.  Thus,
\[P(\text{black ball}) = 1 - P(\text{white ball}) = \frac{k}{5+k}.\]Substituting these values into our equation, we get
\[-0.5 = \frac{5}{5+k} - \frac{k}{5+k} = \frac{5-k}{5+k}.\]Multiplying both sides by $5+k$, we get $-0.5(5+k) = 5-k$.  Expanding and simplifying, we get $k=\boxed{15}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
There are different ways to approach this problem, but one possible method is to think about the number of ways in which the four friends can order their food and then count the number of outcomes that match the given condition.

First, we need to find the total number of possible ways in which the four friends can order their food. Since each person has three choices, there are 3^4 = 81 possible outcomes. (Alternatively, we can draw a tree diagram with four levels, each branching into three options, and count the number of paths from the root to any leaf.)

Next, we need to count the number of outcomes in which exactly two people order meat brats and the other two order hot dogs. We can divide this into two cases:

Case 1: Two meat brats, two hot dogs
We need to choose two out of four people to order meat brats, and assign the other two to hot dogs. This can be done in C(4,2) = 6 ways. Then, each person has only one option. Therefore, there are 6 possible outcomes for this case.

Case 2: One meat brat, one hot dog, two veggie brats
We need to choose one person to order a meat brat, assign another person to a hot dog, and let the other two order veggie brats. This can be done in C(4,1) * C(3,1) = 12 ways (or 4 * 3 = 12 if we list the people in order). Then, each person has only one option. Therefore, there are 12 possible outcomes for this case.

Therefore, the total number of outcomes that match the given condition is 6 + 12 = 18. The probability of this occurring is 18/81, which simplifies to 2/9 or approximately 0.222.

We can note that each vertex adds one triangle to each level above it (assuming it is not the first or last vertex). Starting with the second vertex from the right, there are $4$ levels of triangles above each vertex. This means each vertex contributes $4$ triangles. For the remaining $n-2$ vertices, there are $n-3$ levels of triangles above them, meaning each vertex contributes a total of $n-3$ triangles. There are $120$ total triangles, so we have $4+4+4+(n-2)(n-3) = 120$, which simplifies to $(n-2)(n-3) = 100$. Testing factors of $100$, we find that $n-2 = 20$ and $n-3 = 5$, which gives $n=\boxed{25}$.

We begin by listing all possible paths of $4$ steps that begin and end at $A$.  The four directions that the first step could go in are labeled N, E, S, and W.

If the first step is N, then the fourth step must be S, and the second and third steps must each be E or W.  Thus, there are four paths of this form:

[asy]
size(200);
fill((1,1)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--cycle, gray(.6));
draw((0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,0)--cycle, linewidth(1.5));
draw((0,1)--(3,1), linewidth(1.5));
draw((0,2)--(3,2), linewidth(1.5));
draw((1,0)--(1,3), linewidth(1.5));
draw((2,0)--(2,3), linewidth(1.5));
dot(MP("A", (1,2), NW));
MP("E", (2,2), N);
MP("E", (2,1), S);
MP("W", (1,1), S);
MP("W", (1,0), N);
[/asy]

If the first step is E, the second and third steps must each be N or S, and the fourth step must be W.  There are four paths of this form as well.

[asy]
size(200);
fill((1,1)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--cycle, gray(.6));
draw((0,0)--(0,3)--(3,3)--(3,0)--cycle, linewidth(1.5));

draw((0,2)--(3,2), linewidth(1.5));
draw((1,0)--(1,3), linewidth(1.5));
draw((2,0)--(2,3), linewidth(1.5));
dot(MP("A", (1,2), NW));
MP("W", (1,1), S);
MP("W", (0,1), E);
MP("E", (2,1), W);
MP("E", (3,1), W);
MP("N", (2,2), S);
MP("N", (3,2), S);
MP("S", (3,0), N);
MP("S", (2,0), N);
[/asy]By symmetry, if the first step is S or W, then there are four paths of each of those forms as well.  Thus, there are $4\cdot8=32$ total possible paths of $4$ steps which begin and end at $A$.

Now, we count the paths that go completely around the gray square.  For such a path must have length $8$ (carrying you twice down each of the three edges of the square, and one segment that is perpendicular to each), it must enter and exit each vertex of the square once, and it must have $2$ segments parallel to each edge of the square.  These restrictions force the path to look like one of those in the diagram below:

The probability that both marbles are red is given by: $$ P(\text{both red}) = P(\text{1st red}) \times P(\text{2nd red \textbf{after} 1st red is drawn}). $$The probability that the first marble is red is $\frac{4}{10}$.  After drawing a red marble, there are 3 red marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also red is $\frac{3}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{4}{10}\times \frac{3}{9} = \frac{2}{15}. $$Similarly, the probability that both marbles are blue is given by: $$ P(\text{both blue}) = P(\text{1st blue}) \times P(\text{2nd blue \textbf{after} 1st blue drawn}). $$The probability that that the first marble is blue is $\frac{6}{10}$.  After drawing a blue marble, there are 5 blue marbles and 9 marbles total left in the bag, so the probability that the second marble is also blue is $\frac{5}{9}$.  Therefore $$ P(\text{both blue}) = \frac{6}{10}\times \frac{5}{9} = \frac{1}{3}. $$Since drawing two red marbles and drawing two blue marbles are exclusive events, we add the individual probabilities to get the probability of one or the other occurring.  Therefore: \begin{align*}P(\text{both same color}) &= P(\text{both red}) + P(\text{both blue}) \\ &= \frac{2}{15} + \frac{1}{3} = \boxed{ \frac{7}{15}}. \end{align*}

GPT File: datasets/4-20-total500qs/counting_and_probability/answers/780_answer.json
Extracting Answer from: 
There are two cases we need to consider: selecting two red marbles and selecting two blue marbles.

The probability of selecting a red marble on the first draw is 4/10, or 2/5, since there are 4 red marbles out of 10 total. If a red marble is selected on the first draw, there will be 3 red marbles left out of 9 total for the second draw, so the probability of selecting another red marble on the second draw is 3/9, or 1/3. Therefore, the probability of selecting two red marbles in a row is:

(2/5) x (1/3) = 2/15

Using the same logic, the probability of selecting two blue marbles in a row is:

(6/10) x (5/9) = 1/3

So the overall probability of selecting two marbles of the same color is:

2/15 + 1/3 = 7/15

Therefore, there is a 7/15 probability that both marbles selected will be the same color.

If $\sqrt{a+\sqrt{b}}$ is an integer, then its square $a+\sqrt{b}$ is also an integer.  Therefore, $\sqrt{b}$ is an integer.  In other words, $b$ must be a perfect square.  If we define $c=\sqrt{b}$, then the problem has asked us to find the number of ordered pairs $(a,c)$ for which $1\leq a \leq 10$, $1\leq c\leq 6$, and $a+c$ is a perfect square.  We check the 6 possibilities for $c$ separately.  If $c=1$, then $a$ is 3 or 8.  If $c=2$, then $a$ is 2 or 7.  If $c=3$, then $a$ is 1 or 6.  If $c=4$, then $a=5$, and if $c=5$, then $a=4$.  Finally, if $c=6$, then $a$ is either 10 or 3.  Altogether, there are $2+2+2+1+1+2=\boxed{10}$ ordered pairs $(a,c)$ satisfying the given conditions.

Extracting Answer from: 
We do casework on the possible values of $\sqrt{b}$:

If $\sqrt{b} = 1$, then $1 \le a \le 10$ and $\sqrt{a+1}$ is an integer. This occurs for $a=3$ and $a=8$ so there are $2$ solutions in this case.
If $\sqrt{b} = 2$, then $1 \le a \le 14$ and $\sqrt{a+2}$ is an integer. This occurs for $a=6$ and $a=12$, so there are $2$ solutions in this case.
If $\sqrt{b} = 3$, then $1 \le a \le 25$ and $\sqrt{a+3}$ is an integer. This occurs for $a=22$, so there is $1$ solution in this case.
If $\sqrt{b} = 4$, then $1 \le a \le 42$ and $\sqrt{a+4}$ is an integer. This occurs for $a=38$, so there is $1$ solution in this case.
If $\sqrt{b} = 5$, then $1 \le a \le 71$ and $\sqrt{a+5}$ is an integer. No such $a$ exists.
If $\sqrt{b} \ge 6$, then $a+b < (\sqrt{b}+1)^2$ which is less than or equal to $36 + 2 \cdot 6 +1 = 49$. Therefore, in this case $a+b$ can only be one of $\{1,2,\ldots, 48\}$. Notice that for each value of $a+b$, it is easy to check if there exists a solution.

Thus, there are $2+2+1+1+0 = 6$ solutions from the first five cases. From the last case, we obtain $1+3+5+\cdots+47+49 = (1+49)(25) = 1250$ pairs $(a,b).$

There are 8 choices for seats for Alice to sit in.  Once Alice is seated, there are 5 seats left for Bob, since he won't sit in either seat immediately next to Alice.  This leaves 6 people to place in the remaining 6 seats, which can be done in $6!$ ways.  However, we must divide by 8 to account for the 8 rotations of the table.  So the number of arrangements is $\dfrac{8 \times 5 \times 6!}{8} = 5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$. Alternatively, we can account for the rotations at the beginning, by fixing the table around Alice.  Bob can't sit in her seat, or the two seats next to her.  This leaves 5 places for him to sit.  Then, this leaves 6 unique seats for the 6 remaining people, so there are 6! ways to sit them after Bob is sitting.  So the answer is $5 \times 6! = \boxed{3600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We can use complementary counting. First we count the total number of seatings, which is $(8-1)! = 7! = 5040$, since the people are seated in a circle. Then we count the number of seatings in which Alice and Bob sit next to each other, and subtract from our first count. If Alice and Bob sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single group, which can be arranged in $2!$ ways. The remaining 6 people can be arranged in $(6-1)! = 5!$ ways. Therefore, the number of seatings in which Alice and Bob sit next to each other is $2! \times 5! = 1440$. So the number of seatings in which Alice and Bob won't sit next to each other is $5040 - 1440 = \boxed{3600}$.

Extracting Answer from: 
We define a success as the player winning money, and a failure as the player losing money. Let $p$ be the probability that the number the player chooses shows up exactly once. There are two ways this can happen: either the chosen number shows up on the first die and not the second, or on the second die but not the first. Since each die has a $3/4$ chance of not showing the chosen number, the probability of the first case is $(1/4)(3/4) = 3/16,$ and the probability of the second case is also $3/16.$ Therefore, $p = 3/8.$

Next, let $q$ be the probability that the number the player chooses shows up twice. There is only one way this can happen: the chosen number must show up on both dice. Since each die has a $1/4$ chance of showing the chosen number, the probability of this event is $(1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.$

Finally, let $r$ be the probability that the number the player chooses does not show up at all. The probability of this is $(3/4)^2 = 9/16.$

The expected return to the player is therefore $1\cdot p + 2\cdot q - 1\cdot r.$ Substituting in our values for $p,$ $q,$ and $r,$ we get $$1\cdot \frac{3}{8} + 2\cdot \frac{1}{16} - 1\cdot \frac{9}{16} = \boxed{-\frac{1}{8}}.$$So the expected return is $-\frac{1}{8}$ of a dollar, or a loss of $12.5$ cents per roll.

When counting from $3$ up to $201$ with one step equal to one number there are $201-3+1=199$ steps. Thus $53$ is the $51^\mathrm{st}$ number counted if, and only if, $3 + 50 = 53$.

When counting from $201$ down to $3$ with one step equal to one number there are $201-3+1=199$ steps. Thus we know that $53$ is $n$ steps from the end, where the last number is $3$. So there are $(n+1)$ numbers before it, which means

Extracting Answer from: 
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 possible values for the minute part of the time. For the hour part, there are only two possible values: 1 or 2. (If the hour part were 3, then the time would be after 3:59 am, which is not allowed.) So the total number of possible times that Gerry could awaken is 2 * 60 = 120.

To count the number of times that Gerry awakens to a time that is divisible by 7, we need to count the number of times that the three-digit number is divisible by 7. We don't need to worry about leading zeros, because those will always be divisible by 7. So we just need to count the multiples of 7 between 100 and 359.

The first multiple of 7 greater than or equal to 100 is 105. The last multiple of 7 less than or equal to 359 is 357. So there are (357-105)/7 + 1 = 37 multiples of 7 in this range.

Therefore, the probability that the three-digit number shown on Gerry's clock when he awakens is divisible by 7 is 37/120, which is approximately 0.308.

We can make a triangle out of any three vertices, so the problem is really asking how many ways there are to choose three vertices from six. There are six choices for the first vertex, five for the second, and four for the third. However, we've overcounted, so we have to determine how many different orders there are in which we could choose those same three vertices. That is, if we choose $x$ for the first vertex, $y$ for the second, and $z$ for the third, it will be the same triangle as if we had chosen $y$ for the first vertex, $z$ for the second, and $x$ for the third. We can pick any three of the vertices first, any two second, and then the last is determined, so we've overcounted by a factor of six. Thus, our final answer is $\frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4}{6} = \boxed{20}$ triangles.

There are six vertices to choose from as the first vertex, five left to choose from as the second vertex, and four left to choose from as the third vertex. This would give us a total of $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 = 120$ possible triangles. However, we have overcounted since the order in which we choose the vertices does not matter. Specifically, for any given triangle, there are 3!=6 ways to choose the vertices in order. Therefore, each triangle has been counted 6 times. So, the actual number of triangles is $120/6=\boxed{20}$.

We approach the problem by first computing the probability that the segments do not intersect, and then subtract from 1. The segments do not intersect if and only if the two pairs of points $(A,B)$ and $(C,D)$ are on opposite sides of a diameter of the circle. We can choose any point as the first one, say $A$ (because the circle has rotational symmetry, any choice is equivalent). Then the probability that $B$ is on the same side of a diameter as $A$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that $C$ is on the opposite side of the diameter as $A$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the probability that $D$ is also on the opposite side of the diameter as $A$ is $\frac{1}{2}$, giving a total probability of $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{4}$ that $AB$ and $CD$ do not intersect. Therefore, the probability that the segments do intersect is $1-\frac{1}{4}=\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}$.

There are 9 choices for the first digit (it cannot be zero), and 10 choices for each of the next two digits (since they can be any digit, including zero). Once the first three digits are chosen, the fourth digit is uniquely determined since it must be equal to the first digit. Therefore, the total number of four-digit palindromes is:

9 x 10 x 10 x 1 = 900.

Extracting Answer from: 
We notice that $a^3$ grows much faster than $b^2$ which grows much faster than $c$. So we use $a$ to count instead of $c$.

The smallest $a$ that works is $2$, and $2^3 = 8$. For $a=2$, the equation becomes $b^2+c\le42$. Since $b$ is even and positive and $b=2$ is too small, we try $b=4$, which gives $c\le26$. The possible values of $c$ are $2,4,\ldots22,24,26$; this is $7$ values.

The next possible $a$ is $4$, and $4^3 = 64$. For $a=4$, the equation becomes $b^2+c\le18$. As before, we analyze each even integer from $b=2$ to $b=6$ to find the possible values of $c$. These are $2$, $4$, and $6$, or $3$ values.

The next possible $a$ is $6$, and $6^3 = 216$. For $a=6$, the equation becomes $b^2+c\le-106$. Since $b^2$ and $c$ are positive, this last case has no solutions.

So there are $7+3=\boxed{10}$ solutions.

The probability that the second number chosen will be less than $\frac{1}{4}$ is equal to the length of the interval $\left[0,\frac{3}{4}\right)$ or $\frac{3}{4}$, and the probability that the second number chosen will exceed the first number chosen by a distance greater than $\frac14$ unit on the number line is $1-\frac{3}{4}=\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.$

There are $\binom{9}{2}=36$ pairs of points in $S$, and each pair determines a line. However, there are three horizontal, three vertical, and two diagonal lines that pass through three points of $S$, and these lines are each determined by three different pairs of points in $S$. Thus the number of distinct lines is $36 - 2 \cdot 8= \boxed{20}$.

Note that any four points in $S$ determine a line unless they form a square.  There are ${9 \choose 4}=126$ sets of four points in $S$, and there are exactly no squares, so these points determine $126$ distinct lines.  Each of the $6 \cdot 3^2=54$ lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes passes through $9$ points, while each diagonal line passes through $6$ points.  Thus, each line in the plane intersects at most $9$ members of $S$.  Each pair of intersecting lines must pass through at least one member of $S$, and there are \[
2\binom{9}{2}+3\binom{6}{2}+9\binom{3}{2} = 52
\] pairs of intersecting lines (two pairs of parallel vertical lines, three pairs of parallel horizontal lines, and nine pairs of diagonals).  Hence each member of $S$ lies on at least $\frac{126}{52}>2$ lines, so each member of $S$ lies on at least three lines; this demonstrates that no two lines in the configuration coincide.  Finally, each of the ${9 \choose 2}=36$ pairs of points lies on a unique line, so each of these $36$ lines is counted exactly once.  In total, then, there are \[
126-54+36 = \boxed{108}
\] distinct lines in the given configuration that pass through at least two points in $S$.

There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the units place.

There are $10$ numbers with a $6$ in the hundreds place and a $6$ in the tens place.

There are $8$ numbers with a $6$ in the tens place and a $6$ in the units place. (Remember, we only have the numbers from $1$ to $800.$)

Adding them up, we have $10+10+8 = 28.$ However, we counted $666$ three times. Therefore subtract $2$ from $28$ to get $\boxed{26}$ numbers containing the digit $6$ at least twice.

Extracting Answer from: 
We will solve the problem by counting the complement, i.e. finding the number of numbers between $1$ and $800$ that do not contain the digit $6$ at least twice, and then subtracting that from $800.$

First, we count the numbers that do not have the digit $6$ at all. There are $7$ choices for the first digit (everything except for $6$) and $9$ choices for each of the second and third digits (since they can't be $6$ and there are $10$ digits total). So there are $7 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 567$ numbers between $1$ and $800$ that do not contain the digit $6$ at all.

Now we count the numbers that contain the digit $6$ exactly once. There are again $7$ choices for the first digit, and then there are $2$ choices for where to put the digit $6$ in the second or third digit (it can't go in the first digit since we already counted that case). Once we have chosen the location of the $6,$ there are $9$ options for the other digit. So there are $7 \cdot 2 \cdot 9 = 126$ numbers between $1$ and $800$ that have the digit $6$ exactly once.

We have now counted all the numbers that contain the digit $6$ at most once. Therefore, the number of numbers that have the digit $6$ at least twice is $800 - 567 - 126 = \boxed{107}.$
